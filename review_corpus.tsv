rating	review
1.0	Let's face it. Nintendo only made one good system. That was the Game Boy Advance Sp. I have to admit that the graphics on this are pretty good especially on Nintendogs. But the Psp has better graphics and better games too. Also, the Psp can do more than the Ds. I see on point in the touch screen. You have to be in the same room as the other person for the pictochat to work. And even if you didn't, talking on the phone is much better. Well, Psp rocks! Ds sucks! Just more crap from Nintendo
1.0	I enjoy the Wii sports games and when I purchased two sets of these, one for me and one for my wife.  We both found the items to be cheaply made, not well fitting and not comfortable to use. Don't waste your money
1.0	This Game Sucks The First Was Better. It Has More Guns And Monsters But The Online And Offline Co-Op Make It Worse. The Graphics Are Slightly Better Than  The First But The Interface Is Bad. Buy The First! Disappointment In 2
1.0	"First, there is nothing about this to really write home about. It is a memory cart. You have to have it else your PS2 is worthless as a game machine. Most games won't even play unless you have one, so you have to have one.
My main gripe is the memory size. 8MB? C'mon! WRC and GTA3 both take up almost 1/3 of the capacity of this cart for their save games. And it is going to get worse.
Where are the 64MB carts?
Save yourself some money and don't buy this single pack. There is a twin pack of cards for only a few dollars more. What's to like?"
1.0	This was much better on Nintendo 64. This is just Nintendo milking like they usually do. The 3ds doesn't work well for this game. milking
1.0	"As a big fan of the KOTOR series, I've been looking forward to playing this game.

Then I read about the DRM ...

I didn't buy Bioshock --- because of DRM. I didn't buy Spore --- because of DRM. And now I'm not going to buy Mass Effect --- because of DRM. When will these companies learn? You can't treat your customers like criminals. Intrusive DRM = No sale"
1.0	"Got this as a gift, the game seems to be designed very lazy, definitely NOT worthy of a FINAL FANTASY, i grew up on FINAL FANTASY games since #1 on NINTENDO - and i can assure you, this falls well below standards for the brand name - its so clunky and BAD -

i can't even imagine paying a subscription for this garbage I've played smoother HTTP games - where the creators actually seemed to care about what their presenting and their gameplay content.

its pretty clear from the 1st few days you spend playing this garbage if you can stomach it that long, that the designers clearly are just milking a brand name with absolutely zero care factor to actually the game itself, the combat, and even movement of your character in general is SO BAD it reminds me of pre-diablo 2 clumsiness its like the creators have never played a single MMO but just kinda had an ""idea"" what an MMO is and tried to abstractly create it - which i could accept IF they actually stuck with what a Final Fantasy should be, a THRILL RIDE of AWESOME that leaves me wanting to continue to play it each step along the way with over-the-top epicness, like FF7, followed through with attention to detail and stunning cinemas - this game is NONE of that

after a little research you'll find out just how lazy the creators of this game are and who they have overseeing things, for example 3 YEARS ago apparently they messed up the ability to buy single quantity out of stacks placed on the market place - so literally if you want 1 of something you can't buy it, you'd be FORCED to buy the entire 99 stack for an obscene amount which leads to a lot of market-place scamming and just general badness and its remained that way for 3 years - 3 YEARS - and hasn't been corrected so no i doubt any fundamentals in this game are scheduled to improve - ever - they patch stuff - mess stuff up, and thats it - its DEAD JIM. - their so clearly just milking the brand name its disgusting.

for example the cinemas are extremely poorly done, words fail to describe it, maybe a 5 year old could like them, but definitely not 8-10+ their not even voiced, and the text is so corny and BAD its not thrilling or exciting in the least, the best cinema so far is the trailer, go figure. *makes a fishing reel sound*

They ""tried"" to do a Gold Saucer, i guess... the few games they do have are so lame, sadly as previously stated just a huge disappointment  FF7's Gold Saucer for example puts FF14's Saucer to shame.  They even managed to ruin Chocobo Raceing to the point that its a dead aspect in the game.  It defies logic how FINAL FANTASY could be so LAZY and PATHETIC that their predecessor game from 7 ENTIRE generations back, is better designed and more fun then their current Saucer and i think that speaks for itself with how the entire game is created and maintained.

Character Creation, is also a joke in this game - you get like so few choices on what you look like overall you end up looking like everyone else, there is ZERO ability to manually tweak your physical characteristics for example you get a set slide of choice 1-6 and thats it, so expect alot of other people to look EXACTLY or nearly exactly just like you.

I Wish i could of wrote a better review on this game i love most of the Final Fantasy games, sadly this garbage will never come close to being a real Final Fantasy.  its just a badly designed MMO ""wannabe"" with a brand name it'll never deserve.

If you want a REAL MMO i'd suggest Guildwars 2 - smooth/fluid combat, a marketplace thats actually well designed. Oh and yeah, you can actually tweak every detail about your face - nearly - its not as extensive as skyrims character creation, but you can fiddle with enough of the parts manually adjusting enough aspects that your face won't likely be someone else face. this falls well below standards for the brand name - its so clunky and BAD - i can't even imagine paying a subscription for ..."
1.0	I was pretty pumped for this game as im sure everyone else was, until my second day. The first day i spent trying to figure out what guns and perks were the best. I thought the game was really fun and had a 2.60 ratio by the end of the day. My second day i played with some friends and thats when i started to hate the game. Many guns were extreamly over powered and the i did NOT have fun. I got killed by people sitting in corners with heartbeat sensors and recon. I didn't pay $60 for 1 day of play. I was level 37 and haven't touched it since. I do not recommend this to any COD fan. discrace to the cod series
1.0	I bought a Playstation 4 in September of 2014, and here it is 14 months later and its broken. Your only solution is for me to pay 149 + taxes and shipping to repair what is a know defect from launch day. This is supposed to be a 10 year cycle for this system and here we are 2 years in, and people are having the same issues they were on launch day. This as a consumer is unacceptable, and I don't understand how Sony can feel good about charging an additional fee to fix a problem they knew about before launching this product back in 2013. You have just turned a happy Playstation customer into a soon to be Xbox customer. I don't know if you remember the red ring of death issue Xbox had several years ago with their 360. Well, about 2 years into owning a 360 (1 year OUTSIDE of the warranty), I got the red rings and my 360 was dead. You know what XBox did? Sent me a brand new one free of charge and a box to send my damaged one back, also free of charge. That is customer service and pride in your product. Sony has demonstrated to me that they don't care about their customers and are ok with shipping defective products AND charging them 3/4 of the price of a new product to fix it. Thanks for nothing Sony. and I don't understand how Sony can feel good about charging an additional fee to fix a problem ...
1.0	Worst headset I've ever owned,especially from Turtle Beach! My 50.00 360 headset sounds better than this junk. Definitely 160.00 I'm not getting back...what a waste. Worst headset I've ever owned
1.0	"MAJOR MISSING FEATURES THAT WERE IN TS3:

No create a style (CAST)  NOT possible in future expansions (x)
No modifications to world/public spaces  The park in the demo is a mix of a community lot and public space (x1) (x2)
No normal careers  Law enforcement, Medical, Business, etc. were removed (x)
No open world  You must incur a loading screen between each active lot; each neighborhood has 1-5 lots total (x1) (x2)
No pools (x)
No terrain tools other than paint; everything is perfectly flat (x)
No story progression  Sims in the neighborhood age, but do not have children, get jobs, move, get marriedetc. without player intervention (x)
No toddlers (x)
No way to create/place new lots  And you only have 2 empty ones at the start of the game! EA wants you to spend 100s of dollars on expansions."
1.0	This game is pretty unenjoyable, it's boring and inear with puzzle solving thrown in to make it seem less so. I have no idea how this game got such good reviews. It's truly awful. Boring.
1.0	Hey developer......how about you take your time and test your sloppy product before you spew it onto the masses?  People spending this kind of money on a pre-order shouldn't receive a game filled with bugs and glitches.  Ubisoft sucks and they really need to take some of the money we give them and spend it on game testers, QA and better game development.  Looks good on the outside but the inside is garbage all day do not waste your money. BUGS EVRYWHERE
1.0	"The device was not recognized by my Xbox 360 Slim (which is the unit this device was meant for).  Error E 68 - which according to Microsoft means that the HDD is unusable.

Cannot recommend this device - it is most definitely NOT an official Xbox hard drive, and appears to not be a functional 3rd-Party drive either. Do not buy this item, it is not compatible"
1.0	i only bought this because i believed infinity ward is an very good company...not anymore. they went the black ops route and get ready to pay. WW3 still is the best game in the history of the world and Black ops2 is among the worst. They went with techytrone garbage. now pay the piper. Horrible game same gameplay as Black ops and it sucks! Black ops 2 reincarnated
1.0	I'm sure this controller would be awesome... if it worked. Two in a row didn't, and were subsequently sent back, so I'm going to recommend spending a few dollars more on something higher quality. Even had they worked, the shell was pretty flimsy and the buttons kind of stuck down. Pass.
1.0	Wow! This is quite an amazingly bad game. But it was put together in a few weeks, so it is not surprising. Many of the things in this game are not in the movie at all, such as the stupid pits that are impossible to get out of, and this game has the most amazingly unresponsive controls and bad graphics (even bad for an Atari game) ever produced. This is easily and without a doubt the worst video game ever made. What else can I say about it that hasn't been said about other such 'classics' as the CD-I Zelda games, Sewer Sharks, or even Superman 64? It was so bad that there was a special landfill in Mexico made just for this game, of which everything in entertainment that sucks goes to die! Don't pay any attention to anyone giving this five stars-just look at their other reviews, and you'll know they are liars! Worst. Game. Ever.
1.0	This is for people that want sound quality headphones and that are loud. And I'm sorry to say,but these are really bad in sound and open back headphones like these are horrible cause you can hear the background noise like fans etc that are in the room. Fps players looking for loud boomy crystal clear headsets. Please look somewhere else. I recommend getting the vmoda m100 Horrible sound quality
1.0	sadly i didn't see the spot that says you have to have XBOX gold to play this. Grandson was very dissapointed. Cant use this game.
1.0	"They still force you to configure the driver online.  This was the main reason why I returned my last Razer mouse and stayed away from their products.  The only reason I tried this keyboard was because I was told the driver did not require an online account for configuration.  What slimy middle manager came up with this scheme to gather customer information?  There is absolutely no reason for an internet connection to configure a keyboard.  I guess this one is going back too.  I had a feeling things hadn't change, but the guy who told me is usually very knowledgeable.

Razer, you won't get a third chance with me.

For the same price, I bought an Azio keyboard with a metal body and LED lighting and slightly better switches. Razer still FORCES you to open an account with them to configure your keyboard."
1.0	"WARNING: Spoilers! Read at your own risk!

Stop deceiving people. Many people like myself, have bought this game due to good reviews. It sounded cool, it looked cool. Why not. But when you actually get into about 5 minutes of playing this ""game"", you realize that there is much more dialogue with blowhard, unlikeable characters whining a hurricane instead of gameplay. The protagonist, Neku whines so much that he isn't even likeable, and Shiki is anorexic and annoying. The gameplay is awful! You have to control Neku and Shiki at the same time (fighting two battles on two different screens) You control Neku with the stylus on touchscreen and the anorexic girl on the top with ABXY or UDLR, depending which hand you prefer using. Seriously, how can you make a battle system like this? Especially SQUARE ENIX!

Here's a protip, before buying a game, look at the negative reviews before bothering. Stay away from this garbage. No excuse. It was made by one of the most popular game developers and it had so much potential.

Oh, and the music sucks too. I usually turn off the sound most of the time. Joshua shoots and kills Neku at the end!"
1.0	wheres the garbage can....... One Star
1.0	"I am extremely dissatisfied with this game and with EA. Their customer support is no help at all and the game plain out did not work.

After I installed the game and excitedly launched expecting something similar to the old Need For Speed Most wanted I had logged countless hours on with my old PS2... I was met with a loading screen.
After five minutes I closed the program and launched again... same thing. I let it sit for 10 minutes before going to the internet for a possible solution.
This was a known bug and after a lot of digging with no solution presented I decided to open a ticket with EA.
The response from EA was soon received. It supplied a link and informed me that the ticket was now closed.
The link took me to a moderator response on their forums that said they were aware of the issue and may fix it someday...
Thankfully Amazon was gracious enough to refund my purchase.
Needless to say, when all the uproar over the new SimCity game started up I was not at all surprised. Got this refunded."
1.0	I'm feeling a bit burned on this one. I was expecting tracks, races and such stuff like all the other gran turismo's that I've played since the PS1. I couldn't find a single track or race on this thing. So I'm not entirely sure what the point is other than go through and get all the licensees for races that you'll never race on tracks that aren't here....at least not that I have been able to find on the game. I don't play with others on the internet. I prefer the AI competitors I am used to that are no longer there that I can find. If you like the MMORPG stuff with a bunch of 10 year olds running you off the track in every race then this will be for you. If not this looks like the end of gran turismo series. Feeling seriously burned
1.0	Ok, first of all I never finished the game, but that is because it is so frustrating and boring to the point where you can't possibly finish it without having dreadful thoughts of putting a gun in your mouth. Actually, the thoughts I had of putting a gun in my mouth were much more entertaining than this piece of shiz. I mean seriously, at least if I put a gun in my mouth I get to have complete control of the gun and where the bullet ends up. The latter statement brings me to my main point, and that point being, if I can't control the aiming process of my gun then what am I actually doing? Why do the gaming companies feel like they have to cater to people by implementing a lock on aiming system rather than a manual one. It completely takes the fun out of the entire experience. Whats truly amazing about this game is the fact that even with automatic aim implemented it's still a freaking hard game! So lets backtrack, the game is boring, frustrating, and flat out stupid! why I ask? why?
1.0	"This game is quite possibly the stupidest game I have ever played.  From the first (and ONLY) time I played it, it got on my nerves.  The voice acting is terrible and really annoying. In the very beginning on the boat, you walk into a room and the girl whines ""Ohh NOOOO, my jeans are RUINED!"" That did it for me, I just snapped the game off right there. The graphics are bad for the PS2, and the way the characters move is all jerky and repetative. They wave their arms when they talk and then kinda forget to stop waving them after they finally shut up. The combat system not very good, you just stand in one place and idly blast enemies with badly-animated spells. If you see this one on the shelf, don't even give it a second glance, just move on and get something else. ANYTHING can be better than this. This ""game"" is terrible, don't even bother"
1.0	If you like induced vomiting and have eye diseases than by all means buy this product. It's just a fad that will disappear in a year and lose support from Sony. Just like the PS vita If you like induced vomiting and have eye diseases than by all ...
1.0	"This is one of the most poorly designed RPGs I've seen on the PSP. The camera controls are especially heinous by binding movement to the analog stick and camera to the D-pad. This may not sound too bad if you have two left thumbs, but for those of us with normal digits, it causes enemies, which constantly bolt back and forth across the field, to get out of your FoV with the only way to turn is to stand still and operate the D-pad. There is a lock on function, but because of the speed many enemies move, they frequently break the lock on and leave you staring at a wall. This is especially noticeable with a dragon-type boss very early on who has 8 different target spots but you'll never hit any of them because of how often it rips across the screen, leaving you to chase after it just so it can do it again and plow into you.

Normally broken controls would be enough, but the difficulty, dear god the difficulty. You'll be effortlessly hacking your way through groups of enemies, despite the camera, only to come onto a boss who will kill you before you even realize you're taking damage.

Sadly, the rest of it is rather fun. The sci-fi fantasy style of the game is interesting and the combat, when enemies are actually where you can see them and aren't insta-killing you, is quite enjoyable.

Maybe I'm just doing it wrong, maybe I'm just some noob who doesn't know how the series works. But, I can't get past the unwieldy controls and completely random difficulty. Boarderline garbage"
1.0	"Before you go thinking that I'm one of those cranky people who leaves a one-star rating because of some fluke issue that only applies to me, you should know that the experience I'm about to describe was shared by a friend of mine who bought this game (we were going to play the online co-op) as well as countless other people on discussion threads you can look up on Google with keywords like ""mercenaries ps3 freezing"" or ""mercenaries ps3 not working.""

As I said, my friend and I each bought our own copy of this game through Amazon.com. I was able to download the latest update to the game, but when I clicked the Start button, a message came up saying ""Connecting to EA Servers..."" and then everything froze. Not only the game, but the entire PS3 console froze. I had to reboot. Every time I tried to get into the game, it kept freezing my PS3 console. I never even got a chance to PLAY the game.

My friend and I have since done some research on Google. Apparently, EA has taken down its servers for this game, and/or it's no longer supporting this game. In other words, they're happy to continue selling it, as is Amazon, and taking your money -- but whether you can actually play the game seems not to matter to them.

If EA gave a damn, they would simply recall the game entirely, or add a disclaimer on the Amazon detail page for this product saying that they no longer support the online functionality on this game. But no such disclaimer exists. Instead it says ""Play solo or in cooperative multiplayer mode"" as if that functionality still works properly. And it DOESN'T.

I contacted Amazon customer service and they are allowing me to return the game for a full refund, even though I already opened it (never played it). Kudos to Amazon for that, although I'm still rating this a one-star product. Of course the hours my friend and I spent trying to make this game work, we will never get back. Don't make that same mistake. Stay away from this game. This Game No Longer Works"
1.0	First of all this game is way too hard(on the 3rd leverl for godssakes) and you don't care whether the character lives or dies. I like games that are challenging like Zelda and Metroid but to have something be really difficult on the 3rd level is just ridiculous. Youre much better off with Resident Evil if you want a good game that is rated M.Im so glad I rented this thing instead of bought it. I already want to return it its so horrible. Frustrating. I hate it.
1.0	"Good points ---  Game arrived in perfect condition , loaded well.

 Bad points ---- Game in NOT user friendly, game manual is not comprehensive enough, game picture on monitor fades in and out frequently, and
 purchasing is frustrating with the bar selector.

 Selling was impossible, as I could not transfer my purchases out of my warehouse to the ship for resale.

 The controls in this game are insane !!!!!

 Do not purchase, even at the discounted rate of $ 7.00 its a RIP OFF !!!!! Irratating experience"
1.0	One of the worst far cry games I've ever played. Had it in for an hour and traded it for The Order 1886. How it got so many 5 stars I'll never know how the mighty have fallen
1.0	E3 showed footage of this game that was absolutely false compared to the release.  The released game is horrid.  Bad graphics, scrip, glitches bugs.  Basically everything.  You could get more enjoyment by burning your money in front of you.  This game will quickly go to the $5 dollar bin, and it is not even worth that. Horrid Game
1.0	The disk arrived with no apparent damage to its packaging or scratches on the disk.  However, when placed in my Xbox 360 it says unrecognized disk.  It appears to be a genuine game disk in normal packaging.  I am stuck in a remote place and returning a twenty dollar product isn't a realistic option.  So I put it in a drawer and hope that maybe the disk will work in my Xbox 360 at home.  I am guessing this is just a rare bad disk. Didn't work in my Xbox.
1.0	No campaign mode!!!! Did not now ,did not say.  They should had made it clear that it's multiplayer only this game sucks!!! Multiplayer only!!!!!
1.0	Stopped working about 20 minutes in, signal just completely cut out, no button response.  Tested it twice to verify. Junk
1.0	This is the second pair of these I've gotten and I thought maybe I got a bad pair the first time but these also died really quickly. They are comfortable though Poor
1.0	this in maybe the worst game released for ps4 console so far !!! looks to me that this is a joke game , a total humiliation for a new GEN gamers !... Joke !!!
1.0	"What happend!? Suikodan 3 was probably one of the most inventive RPGs I've ever played, but Suikodan 4 stinks.

The characters are boring, the story is dull and without any plot twists or inspiring hardships. The music is quiet, non-existent or boring. The gameplay lack challenges and the enemies constist of roughly 13 or so models in the whole game  colored in different variations. Traveling from one island to another is slower than mud (literally hours if you want to explore the sea chart). Plus while getting most the 108 characters was optional in Suikoden 3. In Suikoden 4 it's practically required to continue the boring story. Basically it's: find people, watch a scene, find some more people, watch a scene.

I would rather watch pait dry, it's faster paced. A waste of time and energy..."
1.0	"When the Transfer Pak was initially introduced for the Nintendo 64, there were very few games that used it. Pok&eacute;mon Stadium and Mario Gold (see reviews) were the first ones, and Mario Tennis was coming. At the time, I had recently bought Perfect Dark for the N64, and I'd heard that the GBC version would use the Transfer Pak. Based on that, I bought the GBC game. Oops.
My first mistake was expecting an N64-type experience from this game, and that's simply not possible. Perfect Dark was so good for the N64 that it couldn't be translated well for the Game Boy. However, it could still be a good game in its own right. Well, it's not.
The controls, to say the least, are poor. It's difficult to aim, difficult to tell where you're aiming, hard to tell what's happening, hard to see where items are to pick up. It's just difficult to play. I couldn't even force myself to go through the first level.
The sound is nothing spectacular, and while the cut scenes are interesting, the graphics themselves are poor. The cartridge also comes with a built-in Rumble feature, but that really doesn't add anything to the game other than weight.
I can't recommend this game in any way, even for its ability to unlock features in the N64 game (which I couldn't find in the GBC manual and will accept on faith). It's simply not worth it. If you need to get into things in the N64 version, find some cheat codes on-line and save yourself some money. Don't bother. There are other games out there."
1.0	Product design has issues.  Read the other reviews and believe them, can't turn back on until the power dies.  Then you have to wait to recharge.  Annoying! Battery has major flaws!
1.0	"Sonic the Hedgehog on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 has gotten arguably the worst rep. of any Sonic game out there, but there's one game I can easily recall that deserves as much negativity. That game is THIS monstrosity. I was at least able to find Sonic 06 to be a guilty pleasure of some sort, but THIS game is just BAD! There's a lot of questions raised that shouldn't even be here in the first place! Why does Shadow have to have weapons? Why do the characters curse all of a sudden? To make the game ""edgy""? Give me a break! Arguably the worst offender in this is: Why do there have to be branching paths?

Truth be told, I bought Shadow the Hedgehog (via FeaturePoints for Amazon gift cards....Didn't exactly use real money) just to play through its ""neutral"" pathway in the game, which only requires me to get to the end of each level, and nothing more. There was a bit of fun to be had (In fact, the gunplay isn't too shabby), but that fun was bombarded with tons of unnecessary things!

The level design is bad. In the first level, Westopolis, don't be surprised if you run straight into several inexplicable explosions while just trying to get a move on. Other levels don't exactly have as much frustrations, but there are still general problems like not being able to get a good view of where to jump at certain points, and control that feels slipperier than in Sonic Heroes. Instances such as the Shadow clones to fight in one of the later levels, though, get very tedious. Playing through the game would really suck if you do not grab a gun to shoot with, because Shadow's Homing Attacks don't deal damage nearly as quick, and you can FORGET about his punch/kick attacks!

If you thought the voice actors in Sonic Heroes were too cringing for you, then you're going to be absolutely ANNOYED with the new 4Kids/Sonic X voice cast's work done here! At nearly every turn in a level, a character Shadow meets earlier in the level feels the need to say something! And if you're not doing what he/she says you should do, the character will just complain or scold at you for not doing so. Leave me alone, NPCs! Either way, the voices here are AWFUL (With the lone exceptions being Sonic and Dr. Eggman)! Yes, I even disliked Shadow's new voice actor. He didn't even sound much like Shadow in the game!
You'd think at least the music would be good right? Welll.......not really. Shadow the Hedgehog's soundtrack is mostly crappy, with few exceptions.

If all of that wasn't bad enough, you apparently are not supposed to be happy with the ending you get after playing through the handful of levels you've chosen to play through. YEP! In one playthrough, you just have to play six levels, but for the sake of replayability, doing a Hero or Evil mission will lead you to different levels entirely, but each and every mission in this game (With exceptions being to just make it to the end of a level) is a boring, dull, painful chore. Most of them consist of nabbing excessive amounts of objects. I'll leave it at that.
Oh, did I say ""for the sake of replayability""? Oh I'm sorry. What I meant to say was ""for the sake of UNLOCKING THE FINAL STORY SEGMENT"". Yeah....Like Sonic Adventures and Heroes, there's a Final Story segment. They really shouldn't have done that for this kind of game! It completely throws the whole premise out the window!

Ugh.....I believe I've gone long enough here. Just stay away from this title if you're looking for an even decent Sonic title. Whether it be the Adventure titles, Heroes, or even recent ones like Sonic Colors, Generations, or Unleashed, they're ALL better than this game. Steer clear. Simply terrible"
1.0	compared to XBox controllers the buttons are mixed up, the left is the top and the top is the left buttons...also the right is the bottom, and the bottom is the right...wanted to return this piece of junk...but most of my money was sunk into the shipping...no return for that! buttons are messed up

1.0	"ANY songs you download with this game will be tied to the machine you downloaded them to. They cannot be redownloaded or repurchased on any other machine even with the master account you used to purchased them. This is a SERIOUS problem for anyone who makes a significant investment into additional songs, especially if you ever have to replace your PS3.

There are multiple postings in the PSN newsgroups about this problem--wish I knew about it before making my purchase.

The game is tons of fun, but until the copy protection is fixed consider investing elsewhere if there is an alternative. DRM Warning!"

The million dollar question was ""How do you spell conscience?"" Their answer was concience. Obviously wrong.

This is just the first time we played too! We will be returning this game. More than one wrong answer"
1.0	Orphen was another prime example of a rushed game that wanted to be a launch title. It contains a little bit of [bad] voice acting at the beginning, then from there they gave up and no one moves their mouth. As for gameplay, it's very limited, pretty boring, and overall lacking. ... I don't even know why they call it orphen. You just live out someone elses adventure as you join their party. The story is one of the worst ever made. ... my point is the story [is bad], and everything else about this game [is bad], it's the ... game that ever ... . Use the disk as it was obviously intended to be used as. A frizbee. Worst RPG ever made?
1.0	This product is pure garbage. It is made of cheap plastic (typical Nintendo everything is low grade) with tiny metal pins that hold the opening joint together. These metal pins eventually pop out and get lost rendering the case useless. I cannot believe this product gets a high average rating because it is pure junk waiting to fall apart. I've had the two I bought for my kids fail completely in this manner. Garbage. Avoid at all costs.
1.0	I played the 1st DA frequently. I liked the action in that game, but was let down from the graphics and glitches while doing playthroughs. I thought it was awful sometimes. I expect more from EA and sincerely believe that EA has let down their standards producing good to excellent games with realistic life or nearer to real life game characters. Its not an easy task to do it, but that is what I expect when I spend $60 - $100 for a game. Again, I want to reemphasize that I'm disappointed, I am considering other games made by other companies and that EA is disgraceful in promising me and other customers a great fantastic game(s) but this is not the case. I would give this DA1 game a thumbs down and if I could throw them (EA) to the hungry lions, tigers and bears if I was Ceaser. We want and deserve more bone crunching, blood spurting, flesh tearing and blood curdling screams, and more realistic dialogue and screen shots to, than the short cutting, short selling EA SOB's are giving us. Pathetic, disgusting.... I don't think I will ever get this game.
1.0	It is a beautiful game, but contains nudity, and monsters also a naked woman, this is contrary to our religion It is a beautiful game, but contains nudity
1.0	The graphics were okay, but the server problems even with a 50 Mbps connection and a Windows 8 Computer made it a horrible experience. Guild Wars:  Good Value - No Monthly Fees = I won't try it again.
1.0	"First of all the product used to work great. However I have been tracking down a problem with my computer and had to reinstall windows 7 around three times. Now the card game will not activate. The message from the site says ""Result Code: 1 (cprcNoActivationsRemaining)"".

I can not find an email link to customer support, if there is a link they should make it easier to find. I had to use google to find the page to try to reactivate the program because the links on the support site would only take me to self help items that did not mention my activation problem. I have also tried to login in to my account on the site and can not. By the way I have also tried the forum and that had a lot of dead links.

The bottom line is this product used to work great and my wife loved it until it refused to work any more. I am running Win 7 64bit. The customer service is very limited and that is being nice. I reinstalled windows to try to fix a problem with random crashes (BSOD). Then again to install windows on an SSD drive and then again when the SSD drive failed. That is all it took for the program to refuse to work. Please be aware. Very limited activations."
1.0	"Buyer beware - the product description does not describe some important aspects of the game:

This game secretly installs copy-protection software called SecuROM which can cause many problems for your computer, some of which are:

1. When installing the game the user is not informed that SecuROM is being installed.

2. SecuROM denies administrators full access to their PC, and blocks the administrator from editing certain parts of the registry.

3. SecuROM can interfere with the operation of hardware, specifically disc drives.

4. SecuROM can interfere with the proper operation of software.

5. When the game is uninstalled SecuROM is not uninstalled - it remains permanently on your computer.

6. The manner in which SecuROM runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware, and many people do indeed consider SecuROM to be malware.

Currently two class action lawsuits have been filed against Electronic Arts (EA) for their use of SecuROM. This game installs malware"
1.0	"I am surprised at the high rated reviews this product has gotten. I am a fighting game enthusiast and know a good Dpad when I try one. I loved the old-school Nintendo Dpad, and the Playstation 2 Dpad is also very good. They offered precise feel and control. When I got my Xbox 360, I was shocked at how poor the Dpad was on that controller. Everything else, including the analog sticks are so perfect, but the Dpad is clumsy and ineffective. I'd try to hold back to block and end up jumping or doing some other random direction.
So after reading some reviews on different products, I thought I'd give the Madcatz fightpad a try. When I received the package, I already had a gut-feeling that it was no good. This was confirmed moments later as I tried to play with it.
1) The diagonals were very difficult to locate and I couldn't hit them with any consistency. Very bad news in a fighting game. I found that I had to hit a precise 30 degree angle from the down position to get down-back, and that should be 45 degrees, not 30. But this could have been a defect in the particular controller I got, and might not be an issue in others.
2) However, I'm sure for all of these controllers, the feel of the pad would be the same. The floating Dpad is very loosey-goosey. While this makes it very easy to throw fireballs, any slight pressure will move you away from your intended position. So if you needed to hold back to block, you might accidentally jump or duck.
3) The construction/material of the controller feels very light and cheap. This wouldn't have bothered me too much if the controller worked great but it didn't, and this only added to my disappointment. Low-quality Dpad"
1.0	Great sculpt... but not enough functionality in Nintendo games across all systems. Peach burnt this cake.
1.0	"UPDATE***
While the Headset is good it's not something I'm interested in. The package itself was not the original package. The headset was stretched in the wideness department. So it doesn't fully close or cup together properly. Comfort wise the headset is so-so. I normally wear these for about 9 hours a day with some periodic breaks. At first it was good because the cushion was new and had to settle in. These aren't good for extended wear for as long as I wear them for.

UPDATE for the Update.
The headset actually broke. First the right speaker started to go out and then finally the bands on BOTH sides of the headset cracked and to put the icing on the cake the left side of the band came apart which left the cup dangling. I've been nothing but good to this headset. I still have my x12's which have been abused more than this piece of crap headset. DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL.

Update for the update of the last update.. Yeah.
While I still have it, it's incredible it's lasted with the amount of damage it has. I had to literally remove on of the cans, I believe the right side in fact. I then replaced the right side with the left can because the left band was severely damaged to the point where it just would go on your head without you getting pissed. So after modifying the headband, left can, surprisingly the mic and left can still work, however I'm pretty sure the left can has a blown speaker.
I got to admit it has lasted longer than I gave it but my x12's are still kicking 2 years later.. with blown speakers I'm sure. But they are still holding up. Good for gaming, but... (Update)"
1.0	Conker's Bad Fur Day may look like some cute Banjo Kazooie game, but guess what? It is far more complex than Banjo Kazooie. This little twerp pees on his enemies, swears, gets drunk, posses as an army guy, and does other stupid things. This is not a game for children to be playing. He even has sex with girls in some movies. Parents, don't even consider buying this for your five year old. Infact, not even when they're seventeen. Kids, don't look!!!
1.0	"*Update* I just got a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fulton-Espresso-Corner-Media-Stand/dp/B002WRI4HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fulton Espresso Corner Media Stand</a>&nbsp;last night, assembled it, and decided to try moving my Kinect to the edge of it with the Zoom attached to see if it would fix the issue my Kinect kept reporting about it being ""unable to see the floor""... Nothing. Even after getting a new TV stand and placing the Kinect with Zoom RIGHT at the edge of it, it made no difference. So, for me, that was the last possible thing I could've tried to get the Zoom to work for me, and it still doesn't.

I've already initiated my return of the Zoom to Amazon. Nyko's Zoom does NOT work for me.

* ~ *

Okay, so, like most everyone else out there that had preordered the Zoom, I couldn't wait to receive mine. It's simple to set up: cut tape tabs on box. Remove Zoom-containing green box inside of protective, informative product sleeve. Remove instruction guide & insert. Remove Zoom from casing & plastic bag. Remove antistatic film from Zoom. Slide Zoom... wait, turn on Xbox, go to Kinect settings, adjust tilt of Kinect. Turn Xbox off. NOW tilt Zoom over Kinect camera/lenses. Turn Xbox on. Grab calibration card. Stand 4' from Kinect. Calibrate Kinect. Yay! It worked! Choose game. Start game. Wait, what the Hell?!? Why the Hell does it look like I'm halfway sunk into the floor?!? Crap for crap! Ugh!

*Sigh*. Fiddle with TV mount on which Kinect is seated. Remove Kinect from TV mount. Separate plastic frame piece from stand. Use Dremel & flex shaft to cut away plastic from front of frame against which Kinect is bumping when Kinect tries to find the floor in normal game calibration. Reassemble stand & replace Kinect into stand. Put back on top of TV. What?!? What the Hell do you MEAN the Kinect STILL can't see the floor?!?...

THIS was my Zoom experience, and it only got worse. And no, before you start asking, I'm not a total and complete idiot, technologically speaking or otherwise. I simply found that the Zoom shortened ""distance"" enough that the Kinect now couldn't see the floor, because, now that the camera's ""view"" was perpetually zoomed in, the floor was blocked by the edge/lip of my entertainment center, REGARDLESS of whether I placed the Kinect below my TV, or in the mount that I have attached to the top of my TV. Neither position made any difference. And I found that placing my Kinect (with the Zoom attached) below my TV, on the edge of my entertainment center, only served to move the Kinect's focal point further down. My Kinect focused on my knees as the center of the screen when placed below the TV, so adjusting positioning with the Zoom attached didn't help at all.

After trying everything that I could think of for an hour and a half, I gave up on trying to ""tweak"" it. SUPER disappointing, because I was just CERTAIN that the Nyko Zoom was going to fix ALL of my limited apartment space issues with the Kinect. Thankfully, the only game that I'd played pre-Zoom that seemed truly affected by the distance was/is Your Shape: Fitness Evolved. That was the game that, with the Zoom in place, now showed me as halfway submerged in the floor... Interesting, but not fun for workout purposes.

Long story short, if you happen to have your Kinect mounted to the top of your TV via one of those clips, and you want to use the Zoom, you'll need to ensure that your TV is flush with the front edge of your entertainment center/TV stand. I have a stand upon a stand, and my TV is set further back from the edge of my entertainment center in order to ensure the safety of the equipment beneath it. Therefore, in my case, the Zoom doesn't work.

Great as it may be for others, Nyko's Zoom just might not work for everyone out there. Case in point: me. *Sigh*. Bummer. Doesn't work for me, regardless of placement or TV stand (even with the NEW one, the Zoom doesn't work)!"
1.0	Would not play on my PC because of outdated driver. Microsoft no longer supports this simulator or its driver. Nor does its manufacturer. Not supported. Would not play on XP or Windows 7
1.0	Arrived with a broken base. Unfortunately my item arrived with a cracked base making it unstable.
1.0	"Okay I'm going to start off by saying that I have played 5 out of the 7 Spyro games I know of.  The first three for the original PS and Enter the Dragonfly as well as A Hero's Tail.  I found that I loved these games until Insomniac quit being involved in making them and Universal/Vivendi took over.  A Hero's Tail was better than Enter the Dragonfly which had so many bugs and not enough of the subworlds I was accustomed to.
I bought this game figuring maybe, just maybe Universal had listened to the customer's who said they miss the Spyro from the original games but no, they didn't listen.
This game is the polar opposite of the Spyro games for PS in that all you do is walk a little, kill some enemies, walk a little more and.... you guessed it kill some enemies.  There's no collecting of items just fighting.  If I wanted a game that only involved fighting I'd buy Mortal Kombat (which I loved back in the day).  This game was so boring and disappointing I didn't finish it.  It was a waste of my money and I'd sell it but I do not want to torture anyone with a game this boring.  If you like fighting games then this is for you but if you've been a fan of the Spyro series from the beginning you're probably going to say the same thing I did and that is that this game stinks.  Please, Universal, listen to the customers if you plan on making anymore Spyro games and if not, then just quit making them because these last few games are horrible! Where's the Spyro I loved?"
1.0	Well I do not know how this game plays because it crashes sometimes in the game menu or about 5 minutes into the game. There are no patch fixes out that I can find for this. Does not work on Vista 64 bit
1.0	Came super bent pay attention
1.0	"If you are like me, a father just trying to make his child happy, DO NOT BUY THIS!

First, there are no Childrens titles for the 360.  Maybe in a few years there will be some.

Second, this console IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE with most games.  Check the Microsoft site and they will confirm this (about 15 levels deep into the X-Box site).  However, no where in the XBox manual do they tell you this.

Third, Toys R Us will sell you Xbox games(not 360) and claim they will work with the new X-Box.  They simply do not!  In the rare case they do work, you must first download and install a software patch!  DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE!!

Finally, the XBox 360 is a decent DVD player and has great graphics for those with HDTV and the hookups (MS supplies the component cables).

I was a huge fan of Microsoft until this product.  Don't waste your money.  Also, don't waste your child's time. NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE"

1.0	"It is about 2 hrs of gameplay for $40. Not worth it at all. You can get far more entertainment in other games for the same money. AC IV for example. Got mine for $40 on sale and that was $40 well spent and it still provides me with hours of entertainment.

I really just want to caution everyone. You are buying a fix for a game that was released broken and to top it off Diablo 3 right now without RoS is almost unplayable. To want to play D3 means you have to get RoS due to the loot 2.0 patch changes.

They are charging $10 more then expected and there isn't even a ending cinematic. Sorry but if you are going to ever pick this up. Please wait for it to go on sale. I still don't think it is worth even $20 but atleast you are picking it up for a more reasonable price for what your getting.  It sure isn't worth what they are asking right now. So please wait! You will be glad you did.

When you waste money ""unless you just don't care"" you do tend to feel bad. It is my hope that I helped you to not feel this way. Blizzard and/or Activision just isn't releasing quality games. The extra mile is gone. Blizzard games while we all know are about profit they also used to be games made by gamers for gamers. It isn't like that anymore. That crew is long gone. Not sure it deserves even one star."
1.0	Not the game.  A method of joining a site that will provide the game for you; none of which is mentioned in the specs. Game junk
1.0	"The game looks great and runs fairly smooth with only 2 ctd's so far.
It just isn't fun and the battle mechanics are questionable at best.

As an owner of all of the Total war series and all expansion packs and DLC, this game just doesn't have the factor that the other titles with the exception of Empire Total War possess, which is the ""fun"" factor.
This game is more of a chore to play than anything else and you'll find it frequently cheating you which is just irritating.

I swore that Empire Total War was going to be the last Total War game I bought but like an idiot, and because of some good reviews and being a Nepoleonic history buff and an oldtime Avalon Hill hexagon grognard I made the mistake of buying this
mess thinking it would be fun, well,...it isn't.

I give this game two stars, 1 for the production value of the graphics and another because I can feel poor Napoleon rolling over in his grave. Avoid this game if you're a true old time tabletop wargamer, and if you just want something mindless and dumb to play buy it.

After further play I have to lower my star rating from 2 to 1. This game is terrible. Be warned.
I was thinking of buying Shogun2 Total War but after this mess, no way. Nice production poor execution"
1.0	Price is high and only works with some games. Watch out.
1.0	To be quite honest, I found this to be the most tedious role-playing game I've ever played. The narrative sequences are ridiculously long, the graphics are mediocre, and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed. I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it, and I was terribly disappointed. Not worth the money.

1.0	"You would think that such a beloved franchise would receive the care and attention to detail that games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, X-Com, etc. get.  At least!  But this is an utter failure and disgrace.  The a.i. is stupid.  The gameplay is monotonous and boring.  The aliens are not challenging.  They are not encountered in horrifying, interesting, or thrilling ways.  The entire game feels like it escaped a 1980's arcade and someone is trying to steal our money with it in 2013.

If you want to battle aliens and have a lot of fun, buy X-Com or Dead Space.  This is just another spit in the face of all of us Aliens and Predator fans.  When has anyone done a good job making a game out of those franchises?  It boggles the mind.  The world LOVES Aliens.  The idea of being immersed in that world is exciting.  They could have taken the time to produce a spectacular, detailed, story-heavy continuation of the franchise: a feast of our dearest monsters and marines.  Instead we get an undercooked floppy piece of greasy meatloaf with a dead fly on top.

I am sick of waiting for a great game about Aliens.  I declare the franchise dead within the gaming world.  R.I.P. Absolute Garbage"
1.0	I have played every game from the Heroes of Might and Magic Series, and I still play Heroes III occasionally. Even Heroes IV, which brought down the original maker of the series is more engaging and fun.

If you've never played a Heroes game you may find it interesting, but to me it is just too much failed expectations. Dissappointing...

1.0	"This was bought for my brother. I watched him play, I even tried it a few times, and I can not stand it. The ""story"" mode was flawed and not very interesting. The challenge on some of the levels is extreme, my brother could not get past Hulk's level, I could not, and even my dad (who beats Xbox 360 RPGs within a week) could not beat it. It is was challenging because of poor controls, bad camera, and terrible level design. Some levels used the Wii's motion control, but that element was put in so poorly it was nearly impossible. Battle mode was a bit better, but nobody wants to go against a computer so it only gets used when company comes. Battle Mode felt like a Super Smash Bros clone. In conclusion, this game is just the average movie platformer. Some kids may enjoy this, but adults will be shaking their fist at the TV when the kids ask for help. The Wii has a lot better kid-friendly platformers such as:
Super Mario Galaxy
Kirby's Return To Dream Land
Donkey Kong Country Returns
New Super Mario Brothers Wii

1.0	"I miss the days you could pop a disc in, type in a product key, and you were ready to play within 30 or so minutes. No internet connection, no online authentication, no proprietary game launchers. Just the game you bought and you. Bought this game for my wife and it is a damn nightmare to get it up and running. So many problems, I couldn't believe it. Let me break it down.

1. You need to set up an Origin account. This one isn't the worst, but I find it annoying that I need to create an EA login and password just to play a game I bought. I don't plan on using Origin for anything else, so this is definitely an inconvenience.

2. Origin constantly crashes. I tried installing this on my wife's computer, which is windows 10. Origin would crash a few seconds after launching so I tried a few things - restarted the PC, checked for any updates, checked drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled Origin. Nothing worked. Tried googling the problem and it seems to be a common occurrence - Origin does not play nice with windows 10. So I tried launching Origin through compatibility modes for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. None of them were stable. They all crashed. Great. I then tried installing it on MY laptop, which is still windows 7 by default and after a few brief crashes, it finally loaded the store and let me type in the product code. THANK GOODNESS.

3. There is no way to install from the DVD that came with the game. When you insert the disc, an autolaunch window pops up telling you to install Origin, set up EA account, and then install Sims 4. Ok. I did the first two things....let me install Sims 4. But it won't. There are no options. If you click continue, it will just try to install Origin again. So you close it, pop the disc out, pop it in....and it loops the same prompts. Install Origin, Set up account...I GET IT. I already did those things. SO...I look through my Origin launcher for options. Nothing about installing from disc, only lets you download. Great. Now I gotta wait HOURS for this thing to download 10 gigs of data so I can play the game I ALREADY BOUGHT AND HAVE A DVD INSTALL DISC FOR. What a waste of time.

Don't bother with this crap. Just play the old games. EA is too worried about making sure the costumer jumps through hoops to authenticate their purchase that it just is not worth it in the end. Never again When Did PC Games Get So Complicated to Install?"
1.0	Do not buy this game on PC, its a complete waste of money its just another bached consol copy that had no revision before release to PC, its technically unable to run on a PC, because it was never meant for it, am fine with that, but what really gets to me is that they advertise it for PC and stole my money when the game is not designed to properly run on a PC! I couldn't play even 20% of story mode, online is another story, this will be the last time i ever buy a game from COD, this game is dead to me its a complete waste of money its just another bached consol copy that ...
1.0	This game has not aged well.  This is a bad game and unplayable for all but the most nostalgic. Awful
1.0	"Oh, I was so excited when I saw this headset.  See, I have a small head, but not child sized, so over the top headsets are either likely to slowly slide off or be too tight.  I also have small ears, so the earbud included on this communicator is perfect for me.

It looks really cool and it worked for exactly one minute before everything went terribly wrong.

The people I was playing with said the mic made me sound like a Dalek that even the other Daleks wouldn't be able to understand, causing them to label me as ""imperfect"" and exterminate me with extreme prejudice.  Or at least that's what one of them told me later when I went back to using a different headset, because I couldn't make out what they were saying to me either.

Throat mics are a viable technology to send your voice clearly to other people, I've met people who use them for paintball several years ago.  I got this one for $20, which seemed like a good price at the time...  However, after examining the construction and experiencing the performance, I'm guessing the markup between the cost to manufacture and the retail prices is pretty huge.

I'm very disappointed.  Mad Catz used to be my favorite third party peripheral maker.  It's very sad to see them come to this. Crushing dissapointment"
1.0	Dont like the story line mode. its too long and theres no face to face fight mode. I pass. ... . Marvel: Ultimate Alliance
1.0	"I believe this game does actually have the honor of being the worst game yet made for Nintendo DS.  I had the (mis)fortune of renting this game on the day it was released, and I actually had high hopes for it.  Being a big Godzilla/giant monsters fan I desperately wanted this game to be for the DS what ""Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters"" was for the Gamecube.
I was sorrily disappointed when I found that this game in NO WAY makes use of the capabilities of the DS.  Really, this game looks like something that should have been released for the original Nintendo system.  The graphics look about as good as graphics did in 1990, and the gameplay consistes of a neverending assault of cookie-cutter clone enemies constantly sapping miniscule amounts of your energy.  This game is the penultimate realization of frustration.  Think cheap shots, uninspired opponents, and a ultra-repetitive gameplay.  This game honestly looks and plays like one of the games you can play for free at the flash arcade website.  The only good thing about this game I found is the music.  I would not recommend this game for ANYONE other than Nintendo DS or Godzilla completionists.  You have been warned. In the running as the worst game for Nintendo DS"
1.0	This would be a very cool game but it requires Internet  witch totally  ruinous  the whole  experience You need Internet!!!
1.0	Sad it did not work on my new xbox 360. Apparently this is for the old xbox, and I wish that was stated on the cover. Sad it did not work on my new xbox 360
1.0	You gotta be kiddin' me.  What a sorry excuse to use the GoldenEye title to sell games.  Automatically, gamers will think about the original GoldenEye for the N64 (...)to this day in comparison to other shooter multiplayer games.  If I wanted to see cartoons, I'd watch Bugs Bunny.  This game took a major step backwards.  Nothing seems lifelike.  Forget about stealth.  You can basically go blasting through levels without any thought and make it through with little resistence.  This is another game I rented and returned the next day.  Why can't anyone make a decent James Bond game? Don't Let the Smooth Title Fool Ya
1.0	Nothing special. Much Smaller than the original VCR Xbox One. The white it ugly. I would suggest sticking with your original or just waiting for the Playstation Neo Two Stars
1.0	Terribly boring and quite honestly not very fun. The game can entertain you for the first hour or so. Very repetitive and unfortunately BORING. The main character is a walking clich and the controls are clunky. The storyline is incredibly weak. I would pass on this or wait for a deep discount. Boring and Repetitive
1.0	"What started great with AC1 and AC2 was ruined by following releases. I really liked the series since that point even know that not many people (especially here in the US) really liked it that much. So AC depended on its initial fan base in order to get the series and Ubisoft where they are now. Then the plan to gain the US market was completed with AC3. I really believe after Brotherhood the series became trash.

Now we have an unfinished product called ACUnity. We got a half baked disc that needs updates an internet to keep updating it. Well at least you might be able to find less glitches in the Season Pass.

The story is uninspiring and mediocre. The graphics are great, but the gameplay is definitely not running at 30fps. Tons of pop-ups and well a lot of freezing scenes.

I will gave this game (AC Unity), Ubisoft, and the series a 1 out of 5.

I really appreciate franchises like Uncharted, Mario Kart, Grand Theft Auto, etc did not became trash after their fame. What started great with AC1 and AC2 was ruined by following releases"
1.0	"In theory, FIFA 12 should be an awesome game.  You have a ton of leagues and players, ultimate teams that allow you to make your own team from scratch, a build your own pro player feature, and on line play.  Unfortunately, as usual, EA manages to screw it all up.

First and foremost, EA screws the game right off the bat by demanding that you connect to their servers.  EA's form of DRM that takes the game 10 minutes just to start up.  Then you have the problem of being disconnected from EA's servers constantly.  So all those coins you earned in ultimate team -- gone.  The game you just won, now a lose because their servers lost the connection.  I've also had to reset and re-setup by Wifi because the game has screwed up my connection.  Pathetic.  Even more pathetic is EA's response to problems which is usually fix the problem yourself.

Single player is broken.  This had been a problem since FIFA 1 and EA still has refused to address it.  The computer opponent AI continues to act like 5 star players no matter what the star rating while computer teammates still continue to act like complete and utter retards.  Why is it that opponent AI can strip the ball from me by just being within 5ft while my players run away from loose balls?!?!?  In addition, skill moves do not work against the AI, the AI never is caught out of position on tackles, the computer does not understand the offsides rule, slide tackles are rendered completely useless, etc, etc.  Also, things like Ultimate Team functionality and level advancement are ""void"" if you are not connected to EA's servers.  Again, pathetic.

Controls are a positive and negative at the same time.  The game gives you a lot of control and options but it feels like you need to be an octopus to be able to fully control the game.  On one hand, it gives you a sense of accomplishment mastering different things, on the other, the game has been nullified as a pick up and play sports game.  In other words, you cannot just pick up the game a few months from now and play like you did before nor can you play with friends who have never played before as the controls are ridiculously complicated.

Where FIFA 12 shines is really only in the on-line component.  This is the only place where the game actually feels fair and balanced for the most part.  Well, that is until you run into the cheaters.  Laggers, guys with 0.5 star teams that act like 5-star teams, glitch exploiters. It can get really sad.  Probably only 2/5 matches seem like your playing a far match.

In conclusion, I love soccer and I really wanted to love this game.  Parts of this game I really love like create-a-pro and ultimate team but in the end, I felt more frustrated with this game than I enjoyed it.  Do I suck at this game?  Absolutely not.  That is not why I have come to dislike this game.  Most of my dislike for this game comes from EA's refusal to fix problems that have been present since the beginning, EA's complete disregard for people that want to play single player, and that EA is more concerned about it's DRM than the actual game. A big pile of flaming sh...."
1.0	"Update - from two stars to one.

OK, this game is officially pure S&*#! Even the platforming is broken. There's a spot where you need to jump on narrow ledges later in the game and it is a FREAKING herculean feat to just jump forward. You 9 out 10 times (and I know from experience, *REAL STATISTIC!) will jump either just a little too far right, or just a little too far left and die again and again. AND THAT'S JUST STANDING STILL! Next you'll have to do it while avoiding obstacles. At 10 bucks, this game isn't worth it.

I just bought a PS3 after being an xbox 360 owner for years. Don't get me wrong I love my 360, but the PS3 price is in an OK range now, plus the Blue Ray, Wireless, free online play et all hooked me, not to mention the PS3 exclusives. I love my PS3.

Uncharted 2 was a huge hit, and I got uncharted 3 with my system, so I figured I'd get this game to play em in order. This game is a huge disappointment:

The pros:
Good story
Platforming (what little there is of it) is mildly amusing

The cons:
 - Jet Ski up rapids while getting raped by by dudes with guns, grenade launchers and exploding barrels, while FIGHTING the current, goes from fun, to tedious, to frustrating in about 10 seconds (seriously, you'll be thinking, ""Oh God, not that jet ski again"". If the jet ski portions were actually fun, they'd be a nice break, but as is, they're breaking up crap with a few crap sequences.

- Wave after wave after wave of enemies. On the surface this looks like an Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider genre game - well no, it's not, it's a freaking Gears of War clone. Gears of War was all about fighting waves of enemies, you expected it. This game  - jeeze - you'll kill off like  15 bad guys (and that takes a while, a long while) from behind cover and you'll think for a second that was fun now time to explore - NOPE - you'll hear a bad guy yell and another wave will hit, and you'll be pinned down fighting them off - then you'll do it one more time. There's a fine line between fun combat and GRIND, this game leaps over that line, you'll be GRINDING through bad guys thinking, ""Shouldn't I be doing some platforming?"" Usually if they just had one less wave it would be bearable, annoying, but bearable - as-is, it's just tedious, the combat ain't that great.

- What little platforming there is, isn't all that original, but compared to fighting wave after wave of bad guys you'll enjoy the five or six ledges you get to jump around on your way to the next 3 waves of bad guys.

- Later in the game, guys with one shot kills - they have laser sights - when you first meet them there is insufficient cover so they bum rush you. Seriously, who thought one hit kills was a good idea.

Graphics -
(A) Cut scenes - Can you say PS2? The cut scenes, (what drive the story) look like ass, like something from PS2, or XBOX
(B) Game - Graphics on backgrounds are nice, but get repetitive. I mean the jungle looks nice, but after about 20 minutes get's old.

End Boss - Anticlimactic quick time event let down. Lame ending, lame.

-------------------

I hope the sequels are better, I wanted to like this game, but feel the modern tomb raiders are far superior in too many respects. This is a terrible game. Craptastic Gears Of War Clone wih some humdrum platforming thrown in"
1.0	I like all of the major Assassins Creed games made before this one and love part 3 and Black Flag but this one was a step back. I would give it more stars but it's a one star for the series. It felt like they were just making a game to push out and make money. Stuck in one city that every block looks the same. The game controls are terrible every time you get near a wall you get stuck to it. This often times makes the stealth parts impossible. If this don't step their game up I'm done with the series. Come to think of it this is becoming a problem with every game Ubisoft has made lately. If they want to be the new EA then screw them too. Worst Assassins Creed game
1.0	This game is as fun as sliding down a razor blade into a vat of lemon juice.... One Star
1.0	Blizzard is nothing but a greedy company. And as a pc gamer,if you buy this you will be hurting pc gamimg forever. Paying 60 dollars for 1/3 of a game is pure stupidity. You can bet other game companies are watching this to see if it sells. If it does you can bet that other companies will start doing this. Don't let Greedy Blizzard do this to pc gaming. For this one game you will end up paying 180 dollars for the full game. Don't buy 1/3 of a game.
1.0	will it dose not work its a fake controller don't by this stuff its gunk crape it is the trouth. nes controller
1.0	I paid extra because i thought it was by Nintendo as advertised. It's generic. What a bunch of bull. NOT NINTENDO.
1.0	"The Medal of Honor series has been popular for a long time.  After all, who doesn't like playing the same event (World War 2) 25 times?

Anyway though, ""Rising Sun"" is an example of how a company can get away with making trash, and still have it get decent reviews, and have it sell well.  ""Rising Sun"" is a horrid game, and is considered a letdown even to most Medal of Honor fans.

""Rising Sun"" does absolutely nothing new, with a series that had already been around for years, upon years.  At the point of ""Rising Sun"" Medal of Honor was already considered an established series for Sony.

Anyway, when it comes down to it, Medal of Honor's ""Rising Sun"" game is a disappointment on all levels.  The gameplay is linear, and is often totally ridiculous, and the story is well.....nothing new either.

Only pick up ""Rising Sun"" if you want yet another horrid first person shooter, with nothing special in it. A Horrible Game"
1.0	"Doesn't work... stuck at the 'checking for software updates' notification.
Says servers are offline.
HP netbook, win 10 64, 4GB RAM, 2.48Ghz 2 core, 4thread Celeron. Doesn't work."
1.0	"I would agree with anybody that the 1999 Soul Calibur on Dreamcast was a Masterpiece. I really loved that game. But that was 6 years ago!

There is nothing new about Soul Cabibur 3. It's just the same old stuff that you had already played for hundreds of hours years ago.

There are a few new moves and combos, but the new moves just turn the game into a ""Button Masher"". Which means you can easily  beat the game by rapidly mashing the attack button. The previous games made you think a little about your strategy, but now there is NO strategy or real skill involved.

Plus it's on Playstation, so you know what type of graphics your getting (the worst graphics out of the 3 systems). Feels like a 6 year old game !!!"
1.0	this one was unlike any other R&C game their were to many big enemies and not enough weapons to beat them I played all R&C games only 3 I couldn't get past size matters agent clank was ok didn't finish and into the nexus I didn't get past the first world I was really disappointed when I did buy it for full price and found out it didn't play like the other R&C games I love them. ... didn't get past the first world I was really disappointed when I did buy it for full price and ...
1.0	Maybe I am used to the ease at which protective films attach to IPhone and ITouch, but this was a disaster.  There were bubbles, and you couldn't see clearly through the product, and the bubbles and waves were too distracting.  Would not recommend. Difficult to apply and lots of bubbles
1.0	When the servers were up it was a epic game..many years of fun..lots of friends..but now the game is gone..no on-line connection...all you can do is just enjoy the spectacular physics of the game. GONE game
1.0	This piece of trash does not work. Waste of time and money. Didn't work
1.0	"I love the idea of non standard genre story being told in the form of an open sand box... But this is not that.

The best thing one can say about this game is that it is a good idea, executed very poorly. As someone who is interested in the idea of using a sandbox game as a story-telling engine this game was a compelling purchase (though i still held off on getting it until i could purchase it for 3 bucks from the steam post christmas sale). Unfortunately after a few hours of playing it, i've found that what really lets this game down is the game. It over uses cut scenes (constantly usurping control), it handles like arse (regardless of your inclination to vehicles or being on foot) & the combat is ardious: Any game that requires me to pin point shoot a target sure as hell better give me a responsive enough set of controls to actually achieve the result.

But most damning is the fact that this game is not a open world sand box, so much as it is a rail shooter set on a open world sand box map. Apparently there are two ways to do every mission:
1. The way the game wants you to do it.
2. The way that restarts the mission so you can do it the way the game wants you to do it.

Its actual gameplay is repeditive, tiresome & boring after only a few hours of gaming. Nope."
1.0	When I received the controller I installed the software and immediately my sound on my computer sounded horrible. I immediately uninstalled it and did system restore to get my sound back. $40 bucks wasted. Screws up sound on computer
1.0	"This controller could have been fairly useful, but the d-pad is unresponsive and tends to stick in the direction you push it when it actually decides to respond. You can't use the analog sticks as a replacement for the D-pad either, so if you're looking to do so look elsewhere.

In addition, the three buttons in the middle are very difficult to press, and the home button on mine doesn't activate at all. If you want a good classic controller, buy the official Nintendo hardware or look for a different product. Unresponsive D-Pad"
1.0	ok nwn1.....loved it to no ends. still have it installed on my computer to boot. it was an amazing game, and still is. then this comes out........where do i begin. right off the bat, i knew bioware didn't make it playin it....oh well i still had hope. *huge bioware fan* i then go into the OC mode. play that all the way. story wise, good. love the companion setup. and the influence is great....sadly your choices of char don't afect the story line at all. i played it multiple times in spped mode of course, with different classes, and races, and aside from like 3-4 line changes it the same exact game....in nwn1 your class/race/alignment changed the storyline alot. and i think it made that a good thing. almost like playin a while new game with a new char. next the camera.....omgwtf!!!!!!! you accidentally move the mouse to the left too far, bam your char is in the bottom corner, gettin attacked, and you cant see. to play though the maps, i had to be switchin the camera like you wouldnt beleive. up, down, sides to side. and all around. now when i got to MoB....wow. like 4 companions to the bunches from the OC. the story line blew....you had no idea what was goin on. at the end you still had holes in the story line. and its short.....amazingly short. compared to NWN, SoU, & HoU this doesent stand up to it....would i have bought it again givin the chance.....maybe. if your a hardcore d&d fan...youll be disappointed, if your an rpger, the expansion will let you down. Golden letdown.....
1.0	It  doesn't pay to buy cheap on the 360 controller. Got my son this as an extra for Christmas. I asked him how it worked 3 days later and he said the rb button quit working. He's been using his official xbox controller for a couple years now. Don't waste your money on knockoffs. Clunker. Don't waste your $$$
1.0	Loved the Tiger Woods golf games on the xbox 360. Figured on the Xbox1 this game would be great. This game sucks, and like someone posted its basically an overpriced demo. Sucks SUCKS!!!! :(
1.0	"Let me preface this review with the fact that I only play the single player (campaign) part of the game. I have no opinion on how  the multiplayer performed.

This game is way to short, probably less than five hours total if you don't count all the times I was killed. The graphics are so-so and a bit hard for me to see what was going on. The enemies were very difficult to see and sometimes seemed to come out of nowhere, even places I had already cleared. The story is hard follow and really makes little sense. The actions of the AI squad are sporadic and they sometimes get stuck in certain places. There is a large variety of weapons, most of which you have to unlock by scoring points during the level or picking them up from dead enemies. I could not figure out how to use the weapon upgrade system. I played this game on the ""Normal"" level and it was still quite difficult. I did see several bugs throughout the game but I never experienced any lock ups. The first time I played I had to download some upgrades and install a 2 GB portion of the game to the hard drive. Not a big deal, really, but annoying for a high profile game like this. One would think all the bugs would have been worked out before release. I agree with other viewers that this game was released before it was ready. On the plus side the audio was great.

On a personal note I find the trend of these games to emphasize the multiplayer and pretty much provide a token attempt at a single player campaign is very discouraging. If they want to release a multiplayer only game then just say so and we single players will buy something else. No problem. Disappointing."
1.0	Dont plan on playing this game if you don't have internet connection at all times! Thats right single player requires full time internet too!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!! Diablo Online
1.0	Like the title says this trash!!! I see why they sold it for 6 dollars brand new, Not enough customation, limit clothing you can buy or even wear for that matter, the mission are all basically the same go retrieve this item or go same this person, go across the map to save them, only to find out they not thier have to go across the back to find them. It's basically dead rising with grind and parkour elements, with mutants. Do buy this it not worth the 6 dollars I paid for it. Don't Recommend this. Trash
1.0	This is possibly the worst controller I have ever had. It was horribly uncomfortable to hold. If you look at the pictures you'll notice that sections of the back are flat, and this makes it really awkward to hold and press the trigger buttons while also using the analog sticks. Because I want to feel like I didn't waste my money I'm going to try and make myself get used to the controller, but for anyone who hasn't bought it, don't. You'd honestly be better off buying any other controller. Worst controller ever
1.0	Worst game ever all hype! Why the hell does everyone support bethesda. They glitch their games and make the same game over and over. Open your eyes everybody this game isn't 5 stars! So bad
1.0	They make you play the game to unlock functionality of the maker. Out of box you can't do squat. What could be an awesome sandbox is a gated experience and hours of play time to unlock all the maker features.
1.0	Terribly boring. I have almost every next gen game out for both consoles and this rates the worst thus far for me, sad. I really wanted to like it. bad...
1.0	"This review does not reflect the game play.  I placed it on Pre-order because of the Wired Mag story I read about the movie and this games creation.  I purchase every title I own, however I still play games that are now long since not supported.  COD2, CODUO, Novalogic Multi-role Fighter F-16, Novalogic Mig29, Novalogic F22 Lightning 3, Postal, Doom3, UT2003 and 2007. AVP Gold.  Black Hawk Down. These are older games and many are not supported anymore exepcially the Novalogic games.  Since many of these games came out I have updated my system from P3's, to P4's
to AMD Athlon, to AMD Athlon Dual core, then Dual core 2, and video cards from Creative Annilator 256 $429. TO Geforce MX200, 400, Geforce 6300, 7800, 8600, 9800GTX+, 260.  Guess what??? If these games had DRM, I would no longer be able to play any of them.  So this goes back, unopened.

When are they going to learn.  The same was true of Crysis Warfare, and so many other awesome games that they lost tens of thousands of sales.
I have two son's. They is 3 legal copies of each of these games I will not buy.  Oh, I want to check the game out, so I will wait until the cracked version comes out tomorrow, check it out, then uninstall it from a test system I can restore the harddisk from image so to not risk
a virus.  Something I would NEVER do if I owned 3 copies purchased from Amazon....

The irony here is that the Pirates are not paying and they are playing.  We want to pay for legit copies, and we are left out.
If they think that the console games are not crackable,  man they really just are losers.  These must be the same guys that
said VCR's would put Movie theaters out of business.  They said the same about CD""s.  Now they say it with online music. Itunes seems
to be making artists a lot of money.  In fact, many artists skip going with a label and produce the album themselves and sell it on Itunes.
(They should have thought of that... Who needs a record label????)  If you have a PC, M-Audio interfaces, or even buy a $400 16 channel mixer, and mic's, either way, you can produce your own albums, sell them, and screw the company.

It was nice seeing some new movies being released to FIOS on-demand before it even came out in the theaters!  Smart!
People who like the theater experience will buy it and see it on PPV, then go see it in the theater.  These are the
guys earning the big bonuses. Losers, with MBA's from Harvard, Princeton.

They make movies about a kid running a toy company R&D department.  Well there is some truth in that
and some reality that needs to go in. But my God, these morons are killing their own game sales! I pre-ordered this and now I am returning it - DRM!!!"
1.0	I really enjoyed all the mega man x series growing up, and decided to purchase this to replay my child memories. The game is still fun overall, however this switch port is really disappointing in the fact that more then 2 or 3 enemies on the screen lags it down noticeably, to the point it is playable, but completely unfun. I love the megaman series, but I can not recommend this title unless nintendo patches this. I would recommend checking online if this issue has been fixed or not. Poor switch port, game lags bad
1.0	"I have had this POC for 1.5 years.  Most of the time sitting on a shelf since it is unusable.
It looks nice.  And for the price I paid, it should work flawlessly.  It doesn't work consistently.
It will freeze and certain (apparently random) keys will not work.
Just now, I was typing and in the middle of my sentence the 't' key wouldn't work.  A fundamental and profound flaw in any keyboard.  This happens to me about every 10 - 20 hours of operation.
The backlighting only illuminates part of the character, especially on the numbers row across the top.  Partial illumination is not what I signed up for.
The tactile feedback is almost nonexistent.  Perhaps some will not mind, but that together with the failure of keys to work at all makes this a lemon.
Finally, it is very thin, so I don't like the angle my hands/ wrists are at when typing.  I believe this is just my preference and may actually make me more prone to carpal tunnel since I like a higher keyboard.
OK, thats it.  Very unhappy with this.  Razer DeathAdder mouse by same company is wonderful. But this is really really bad.
It could be my Windows 7 64 bit OS has something to do with it, but I just pulled the keyboard off the shelf and downloaded the most recent driver (3.0) and no joy, it still pulls the same stuff it did a year ago.  THe keyboard I'm using to type this isn't programmable, but its also 10 years old and works great (Dell).  SO for the price you should avoid like HIV. Do NOT buy this"
1.0	I would like to begin and say Battlefield: Bad Company is one top favorite multiplayer games.  I would come home from a day at work and would play with a friend online.  We would have a competition to see who would get more kills.  Pure gaming bliss....  I enjoyed that game so much, that i tried to buy another game from the same series.  Big mistake....  The only pleasure i could see someone having from this is either from unlocking achievements or flying the overpowered helicopter in multiplayer.  The controls were horrible, the weapons were worse and your AI squad were next to useless.  The multiplayer servers are going offline for good on 08/11/2011.  The only pleasure i have in playing this game is knowing that once i beat the game, I won't ever play it again.  YESS!!! Do not buy this game
1.0	"Honestly, once your Sim decides to become one of the 3 professions (acrobat,singer,magician)....all you do with them is have them try out for gigs, perform for tips & then perform at the gigs they booked.

Watching them do the tricks or juggling is fun...a couple times....but when that's all they do....it's a bore. In the normal Sims game, your Sims can form a band. You'd think the new singer career would fit right in, right? Wrong. A singer is an all alone profession. No duets (unless you get another Sim to sing karaoke with you)...no back up singers, no bands. Just your singer....out there on the stage.

If you singer Sim decides to switch careers to something else...then their singing days are over. Can't sing on any stage or even to their own kids. Other than the also boring karaoke...if you want them to sing....even as a hobby....you have to switch them back to that profession.

Expansion after expansion only adds a few new things to do...that are only fun for a short time. Your Sims basically have nothing else to do during their Sim day. The previous game of Sims 2 seemed to have much more creative people involved with it....this one tends to have people who do 'just enough' and no more. This expansion could have been much better...but they stopped short of producing a great game & instead...settled for just OK.

Disappointing and not worth the $40 price tag. If you can wait....try to hang in there till you can receive a price drop. I purchased my copy at Target because they offered a $10 gift card. Another bore"
1.0	"I've been a NFS fan for years, and have to say this is the worst of the worst.

The pros:
FINALLY, we get a story driven game. First time in years that they've done this, and the story is kind of decent

The cons:
Once you get to a certain point (I made it to about lvl 10), the game is all about drift, nothing more. This has to be one of the worst adaptions of a racing game known to man, and 'drift', well, yeah, it's horrible.

The UI is probably one of the worst I've seen for a NFS game. So many distractions when in a 'race' it's not even funny.

Network lag is horrible. Like, you just sit there for seconds and the game jumps at points

Required online for a racing game? Yeah, that's a joke

If you ENJOY speeding around corners, collecting points for random garbage, this is the game for you. Unfortunately, that's all this is at this point. EA has taken 'fun' and just ruined it. more like NFS: Drift"
1.0	"EA games.  It's not in the game.

EA games has ruined many games in the past, and this is yet another one.  Need for speed is a RACING game.  It's the most fun when you're playing with friends in split screen mode.  No I don't want to play online.  I want to play in split screen mode.

Don't buy this game and don't give EA money for releasing such crappy games.  If you keep buying this crap, they'll keep releasing more of this crap. A racing game that doesn't have split screen mode.  Don't waste your money."
1.0	"The keyboard was comfortable to use for long periods of time. It was also responsive. I was worried that the red light would become annoying after a while (my last keyboard had a blue light), but it did not. I had no issues with it for the first month.

However, one month and three days later it simply stopped working. The lights would come on when I would plug it in to any computer then go off only seconds later. Windows claimed that a broken USB device was connected. I had my previous keyboard (a saitek) for about three years and decided to get rid of it because the letters were wearing off.

I was very disappointed in how quickly the keyboard died. I recognize that it may have been a lemon, and maybe most people have been extremely happy with their Cyborg keyboard, but my experience was less than satisfactory. 1 month of normal use"
1.0	My PC picked it up as an actual PS3 DualShock.  However, it is not friendly to third party controllers.  When I plugged in a controller [that wasn't Dual Shock 2], on my PC only Button 13 blinked.  Did not pick up any other input. Rhythm Gamers, beware
1.0	You can download call of Duty 2 on the internet and it will run. But this one the mp would play but the sp will not run at all. What is the matter.
1.0	"To answer the first question on everyone's mind, yes.  This newly redesigned PSP 2000 case WILL fit your PSP game console even if you have the 2200mAh battery with extended back-plate.  There is designated cutout in the rubber that allows the PSP 2000 to rest perfectly in place with or without the extended battery cover.

Now the explanation for the one star rating:

The case itself looks a lot sleeker in the package and in pictures than envolped around the PSP system itself.  It has a cheap plasticy feel to it complete with a second rate, floating hinge that always seems as if its on the verge of breaking loose.

Also, unlike other PSP cases I've owned, the PSP logo isn't etched or inscribed onto the case lid, even though it looks that way in pictures.  The PSP trademark on top is just a thin piece of printed cardboard placed underneath the clear shell.

This case also comes complete with small rubber grips that, when opened properly, can be used to stand the case upright so you can view video files without holding the PSP in your hands.  Only problem is the rubber grips never seem to hold onto whatever surface its standing on.  It will slowly start to slide downward unitl it is laying flat on the table, the counter, the desk...etc..

This case looks, feels and performs more like a $5.00 cheapo instead of a $20.00 quality product.  For this price I would find something better (and you can...very easily) instead of settling for this lesser product. CHEAPLY REDESIGNED FOR THE PSP 2000"
1.0	"Honestly I think this is pretty bad, and let me explain why.

It says you can customize the opponents, the style of the tournament etc...
This is all true. However other than the tournament settings, the changes seemed to have no effect. I wanted to simulate more of a real table with at least 1 bad player, an aggressive player, a tight player... etc. So I go in and change the parameters.

However the opponents played the same way no matter what I did with them. I even changed the strength of each hand to total opposites of their defaults, and the opponents all played the same way. I don't think changing anything has any effect.

I tested this thoroughly, I went and changed each opponent at a full table with various settings, playing with them for hours and still... they played just as they were playing before I altered them.

It's ok as a simulator to play somewhat competent opponents under any style of tournament you want, but since that's all it is, and it doesn't do as advertised, I give it a 1. Don't believe the hype.."
1.0	"Unlike Rogue Spear and Urban Operations, which were developed by the very talented people at Red Storm Entertainment, Black Thorn was developed by a team of UbiSoft employees in their Montreal office who were trained by people from RSE, but who obviously lack their talent. The level design, modelling, and particularly the texturing were second-rate and amateurish, and doesn't compare to the quality of RSE's work on the previous installments in the Rainbow Six/Rogue Spear series.
If you are a fan of Red Storm Entertainment's work then it might be worth buying for the bonus CD (American version only) that contains a feature on the making of Ghost Recon, but don't expect Black Thorn to be on par with Red Storm Entertainment's previous work in Rogue Spear or Urban Operations, or even Covert Operations for that matter. If it weren't for the bonus CD about Ghost Recon, I would have returned it and asked for my money back, it's that bad.
Contrary to the rave reviews that UbiSoft employees have been posting around the net posing as fans and customers, Black Thorn is by far the worst in the series - hardly ""the best"" as they have been claiming. Second Rate and Amateurish"

1.0	"I had, unfortunately, very high expectations of this game. I mean, Final Fantasy... MMORPG? Whoa! The best of two worlds collide!

Unfortunately, the result of the collision is a horrid mess.  Square smashed this game out of the park graphically, and the sounds effects and music are decent too. Unfortunately as well, that's where the positives stop.

- The UI is awful and unintuitive.
- Play control is ruthlessly cumbersome.
- Players are (mostly) unhelpful to new players.
- Race/Class combination is pretty boring. Each race has a ""best"" class and most people go that route.
- Did I mention play control is horrible?
- The combat system is, also, unintuitive. I *highly* recommend playing a melee character as a first. Any casting class will be killed over, and over, and over. And apparently this is just blindly accepted.
- The chat system is pesky.
- Oh yeah... the play control? Don't even get me started on it.

Now, the reason I weighed Play Control so heavily is because, in ANY MMORPG, you're going to spend a LOT of time traveling around. A *lot*. That, mixed with the horrible UI and combat system just make for a very frustrating experience. If you want a game with any sort of substance? Do yourself a favor and check out World of Warcraft. Or even Dark Age of Camelot. Bag... of ..."

1.0	"Diablo 1 and 2 were excellent games, as was the LOD expansion, and Diablo 3 cannot be reviewed without it's prequels factoring in. 90% of what made the Diablo franchise great has been  removed from Diablo 3. The art style is colorful and ""cartoonish"" and the music in game is equally forgettable. The games mature content has been greatly reduced, most likely to appeal to a younger audience. The single player (which you are forced to play online) is relatively brief and feels unsubstantial. If you were a fan of the ""lore"" and story of the old games you'll be very disappointed, many characters are spoiled or just made laughable, many times during the game you'll find yourself shaking your head. I tried to enjoy this game going into it. In spite of it's terrible release (servers were malfunctioning for a week or so) and the continued interruption of lag, during a single player game, I withheld any judgment until I had beaten the game. I don't recommend buying, certainly not for the sticker price anyway. The combination of cartoon art, cliche dialogue (""you'll never defeat me HA HA HA!"")and oversimplified game play makes it mediocre at best; its just not the same franchise any more. Liked Diablo 2? Don't play 3"
1.0	"One of the listed features for this game is ""Accessible and Fun"". The game is neither. The single-player uses the worse catchup A.I. I have ever seen in a racer. Couple this with the fact that you have to place first in order to progress and you end up with a game that is neither fun nor accessible, it's just frustrating. The issues don't end there though--even if you only want to play multi-player you will be frustrated by incredibly long load times. Sometimes the load is longer than the actual race! The developer promised to fix this but 2 months post release and not a single patch has been released for the game. Finally the cart handling is just too sensitive. You will find yourself frequently over-steering and bouncing into walls because of the controls. Eventually you may adjust to them but it still is not fun to drive in this game. This game could have been brilliant but the developer spent too much time focusing on the creation tools and not enough time on the core game-play. Skip this game. Not Accessible nor Fun"

1.0	ICK One Star
1.0	"I wanted to update my opinion this game because of glitches that were present and unfortunately now notorious among gamers. I had previously given this game 3 stars just because I've been a huge fan of the ""Battlefield"" series especially with both Bad Company games and Battlefield 3 from 2011. I was very excited for ""Battlefield 4"" since I was still playing the multiplayer of it's predecessor ""Battlefield 3"" long after finishing the campaign mode of that very game. Since I was excited for BF4, I was hoping for another great addition to the franchise.

Sadly, now that months have gone since the original game came out, and there are so many technical problems with the entire game, that couldn't be any farther from the truth. I had previous defended this game for a while as I had enjoyed it despite the technical issues that had surrounded it.

However, thanks to some 'patches' and DLC issues, the games functionality has now deteriorated to the point that it now actually freezes up the entire console to where I had to restart the entire system as many as six times in a single day. I don't know what on Earth is going on at EA, DICE, or whatever companies were involved in the production and release of ""Battlefield 4"" but this game's glitches and terrible lag issues have now been compounded to the point that they are now virtually irreparable and killed anything that I previously liked with the game.

First off, the graphics take way too long to load up. I found myself having to wait in order for the graphics to load up right as the iron sights on the respective weapons were nothing more than 'opaque plates' that blocked the view of the target enemy players. But that's not the worst of the issues. At least when it finally loads up, I can actually play the game and have a good time. Right?

WRONG! Beyond just that, the game engine's are so messed up. I've lost track of how many times I've aimed the damn gun at the enemy players and the gun just will not fire, even after I pressed the button. Then there's the problem of no hit-markers. I can't tell you how much this has just about ruined the entire game experience.

The campaign version has beautiful graphics but the damn game will not save over and if you turn off the console or switch to multiplayer, the campaign mode has to be completely restarted. This literally puts entire weapon categories out of the question. There is NO excuse for this kind of glitch to go on this long! NONE! I've unlocked all the weapons from the Co-Op version of BF3 and for the most part, are fun to play multiplayer with. Yet they are out of reach due to this horrendous glitch that deletes the campaign saves. I had to restart the campaign mode at least seven times because of the saves being lost. I finally simply gave up on the campaign mode. This was the first time I ever truly gave up on a campaign mode of a video game in over 15 years.

Finally, and likely the two most inexcusable glitches that have turned BF4 into a horrendous pile of electronic cyber-debris is that the first is the graphics suddenly turn into a bizarre palette of psychedelic colors similar to when a camera does not work properly and all of the environments in the games servers turns into a visually-disorienting screen full of colored shapes. Even aiming down the sights, such as sniper rifles gives you an opaque shape of colors that obscure the targets. There is no excuse for this! It is 2014 and these graphics at times looks either like 2003 or earlier-quality (no offense to Battlefield 1943) or like some amateur's prototype beta that was made in someone's bedroom computer. The second, and ultimately fatal glitch is that the entire game freezes up along with the entire console, which can only be dealt with by shutting off the console and restarting. This happened as many as eight times in one day for me and finally after a second consecutive day of this happening at least six times within a single day, I have had enough of dealing with this.

As I said earlier, I have no idea what on Earth is going on at EA but there was zero, I repeat, ZERO excuse for screwing up so badly on handling this game, especially a game that is part of a series as popular and loved as ""Battlefield"" is.

I gave this game many chances hoping that something would be done to make this game finally worthy of my time and functional again but as mentioned earlier, too many instances of it freezing up, and potentially damaging the console's very system, has made BF4 into a gaming disaster of near-monumental proportions. Much worse than ""Aliens:Colonial Marines"" and worse than any other EA title, BF4 has left me incredibly angry and let down on all fronts. I had very high expectations for another great additions to the Battlefield saga but this game and all of it's horrible glitches has really damaged my faith in EA, DICE, and the Battlefield series. There were other games in the past that had problems but eventually were fixed and previous disasters were finally made playable. Not BF4. The game was glitchy when it came out but the problems have only gotten worse since and now after so much anguish, I'm ready just move on to other games.

It pains me to say this but BF4 could just about cause greater damage to the Battlefield series than even ""Medal of Honor: Warfighter"" which I actually enjoyed, did to the ""Medal of Honor"" series over a year earlier. ""Medal of Honor: Warfighter"" did not deserve the harsh criticism it got. ""Battlefield 4"" deserves to be taken out of circulation, the entire EA/DICE house needs to be cleaned out, a fresh new crew needs to be brought in, and either ""Bad Company 3"" needs to be released or else an entirely new Battlefield spin-off series needs to be started in order to salvage this franchise as BF4 is hands down, the worst handled game I've ever dealt with and probably one of the worst games to have infected my console.

I'm so angry right now, that the Battlefield series has been damaged, if not nearly killed, by such a crushing and ignominious disaster such as this. Avoid ""Battlefield 4"" and stick with BF3. Even ""Need for Speed: Rivals"", as problematic as that was, was light years above this.

Now excuse me while I go back to playing both ""Bad Company"" games and BF3 and try to erase this disaster from my console and make it a painful chapter that has finally closed in my gaming history. EA/DICE has a huge mess to clean up from. Update of my review: THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE!"

1.0	"I'm kicking myself - because there it is - on Amazon's page - these won't fit into the Nintendo DS stylus slot on the back. Wish I would have noticed that sooner - as cool looking as they are - I probably wouldn't have bought them.

I'm also a little miffed that the packaging says it's specifically made for the DS Lite - which clearly it is not.

What's the point of making a stylus like this if it doesn't fit? I can understand making a big ""hard to loose"" stylus - but it's like they got almost everything they needed to do to make it the right size - and then just cheaped out at the end (handle). They even went so far as to make a little nub that sticks up like a regular stylus - but it's not even close to where it needs to be to fit.

Perhaps they couldn't offer the level of detail they wanted if they made it fit into the stylus slot. However, I would have been happy if the stylus fit snugly into the opening - and then had a portion sticking out - that would have been fine.

As it is now, it's just waiting to get lost. And I definitely won't be buying this product again. what's the point if the stylus doesn't fit?"

The wrestlers are just laughable to look at it. Pass on this game. It's not even worth a dollar in my opinion.

1.0	I cannot believe how horribibly atrocious this arcade stick was. I say was, because I put the p.o.s. out of it's misery for good, instead of returning it for a refund. Upon destroying that hunk of junk, I plugged in  my regular ps2 controller and dominated opponents that had only moments before put me to shame. The joystick was so chintzy in it's design it would only pull off the command half the time. I must mention that it was nothing like an actual arcade stick, which is fluid and accurate. Imagine trying to draw a smooth circle in an octagonal plastic stencil, and that's how the stick felt. The buttons worked fine, but also felt cheap. I honestly don't know what they were thinking here. The only reason I bought the thing was for the accurate stick movement that a normal controller lacks, but shocked was I as to how much worse this handled than my normal ps2 controller. Had I returned it, it would simply be re-sold to some other poor shmuck, I could not allow that to happen in good conscience. WORTHLESS!!!
1.0	"I cannot tell you how much I hate to rate this product so low. As a child's toy (maybe around 10 years old). It might not be so bad, but if you're over 15 years old. This product will most likely be a disappointment to you.

The issue I have with uDraw is the tablet itself. It's pretty terrible/cheap. You will never be able to draw a one to one ratio with this tablet. Your ability will always be hindered by this tablet.

If THQ would have partnered with a tablet company, or just let you plug in our own tablet. This product would have been greatly improved. The software is primitive but useable by all standers.

I'm not going to nitpick this tablet as it under performs the cheapest PC tablet (25 dollars tablets), but I would suggest you buy a PC tablet and download MyPaint (free drawing software).

I really like the idea of uDraw and I would love to see a refined version of this product, but with the poor sales and the lost THQ took with this product. I just don't see anyone else in the near future doing something similar.

I give this product, uDraw Game Tabel, by THQ a 1 out of 5. Great Idea, But Poor Execution"
1.0	"This Sequel/Movie Tie-in is short and bitter.

The game is not a true sequel as the whole game takes place after War for Cybertron but before Fall of Cyberton. It's a side story really, it starts in the Movie fictional world and it's about certain event that happens in the past and you replay those events that occured in the Games universe.

The Movie universe parts of the game are events that happen just after the movie.

Graphics are probably the worst of the whole series, super pixelated paired with the poorest AI and voice acting possible. Even the PS2 and Original XBOX could have pushed out a similar looking game.

The game and it's story serves no purpose other than to sell something titled Transformers at the same time a slew of Toy and Movie comes out the same time and to gouge every dollar from you.

**** - BEWARE - SPOILERS BELOW - *********

They talk about Multiverses and your not sure if the events of the game really relate to each other in the movie world because everything is super vague in details. The main object in the game you really never see it in it's true glory, it's more of a tease than a plot.

The ending is the worse as it basically says that your time is wasted in the game *****SPOILER***** because The Dark Spark (The Decepticon Matrix) travels the multiverse and when it leaves the movie universe at the very end it goes back the Game universe and then the credits roll. So it may be the next TRUE sequel to Fall of Cybertron.

Your never sure that the two universes are really part of the same continuity or if their separate tales woven together and the ending makes it more confusing to know what you exactly played for. More of Side Story than a full game"

I do have the original, patch it, use mods, and play on my windows 7 pc, without any problems at all. None.  I have the expansion packs as well, and of course Oblivion too.  I noticed there are those trying to rip others off by Morrowind and offering it for over three hundred dollars, what a shame, Bethesda should offer the original Morrowind since its old, and stop that nonsense.  If you never have played it, perhaps it will seem dated but with the new mods, overhauls, rebirths, or rebuilt type of mods, its a delight all over again and Im enjoying it once more. I loved it the first time, love it now, and love the additional mods available too.  Thank you modders, you made the world off Morrowind alive again.  If Bethesda ever came out with a new Morrowind, I have no doubt people would buy it in a heart beat. This one has to play through the Steam Client, just FYI"

1.0	"I am not reviewing the actual video game in this review.  What I am reviewing is the crap that they call special in which you pay an extra 30-40 dollars for in this limited/special edition.  First off, the outer case is made of cheap and flimsy plastic.  When I opened it up, I expected the batarang to be at least somewhat cool.  I thought it would be made out of metal and be detachable from the display stand.  The batarang is in fact made of fat plastic, the kind that toddlers toys are usually made of.  The batarang is also undetatchable from the stand. When you hold it, it feels light and very cheap.  Mine is not even able to be displayed as there are several deep gouges in the face of the batarang.  I wouldnt want to display the piece of crap anyway.  The leather bound book is also nothing special.  It is basically a thin piece of fabric wrapped around an average instruction manual sized book with no useful information in it.  Everything about this set screams CHEAP!!!.  It is an insult that whoever produced this limited edition set, decided to ""stick it"" to unsuspecting fans by charging 40 dollars more for 2 dollars worth of extras. My opinion is for you to save your 30-40 dollars and put it towards something else.
  On another note, I have not yet played the game, but I have heard nothing but good things about it. cheap garbage"

When I went to play again with this linked to my account, I realized it basically finishes the game for you in a massive immediate cheat code.  I'm not sure what the point is when all the vehicles are already unlocked.  That seems to eliminate about 80% of the whole point of the game.  As far as I know, you can't get rid of this once it's locked onto you account either, so Burnout Paradise is basically unplayable now for me. This is a cheat pack that ruins the game
1.0	"Don't waste your money!  I have bought MANY Amazon download games in the past and I have never had a problem downloading.  Now I get an error message with this game.  It seems that I am out $5.  I have tried over and over and I still get the same message ""requires elevation""  I have no idea what that means.  I will be contacting Amazon to try to get a refund. Impossible to download"
1.0	"Run and jump and fall - repeat.  I just quit the game, having spent an hour trying to get past one point.  It's supposed to be a simple wall run and grab a bar, but I just fall and fall.  Run up the escalator, run down the hall, jump into the attic space, go break the glass, wall run to the bar - which is right there, in her stupid face - DO NOT GRAB THE BAR!! - fall to your death.  Repeat this 50+ times, snap game disk in half and write a review on Amazon.
I did find this section on YouTube and the guy playing it just ran along the wall and she grabbed the bar on the first try.  What am I doing wrong? I have no idea and that's the problem.  The so-called tutorial at the beginning is a joke.  There's the gas pedal, there's the brake, use the round thing to steer and there's the freeway.  Try not to get killed.
I will admit that I hate climb and fall games like Assasin's Fall and Prince of Falling.  I also hate games with a wimpy character who can't fight and is also stupid.  I especially hate games, like this one, with a loud mouth who nags you from a safe place while you get shot at.  They never even let you kill them when you finally meet.  It's just not fair. I'm falling!!!"
1.0	It never worked for me on the 4 computers I tried it on. (Windows 98, ME, XP, and XP) even when my computer lived up to all the specs on the box. A definite do not buy! Just a heads up for anyone looking at this game..
1.0	My first and foremost beef with SFV is that there's no arcade mode whatsoever, only online multiplayer. Secondly many of the classic characters are only available if you pay an extra $29.99 to buy the SFV season pass. And what little Single-player game there actually seems to be is in the form of three to five fights per character in the worst excuse for a story mode I have ever seen in a video game this far. I've heard more content will become available in the future through updates, but how long are we going to have to wait for that?! I mean you pay $49.99 plus tax for a game that's not even anywhere near complete! Capone should be ashamed of themselves for this insult to all their longtime SF fans. After this garbage I don't think I'll be purchasing the next SF game, of that I'm pretty certain. I would give Street Fighter V zero stars, if that were possible.
1.0	"I have played Tomb Raider since the original came out in 1996.  I've played most of the games in the franchise.

This one doesn't feel like a Tomb Raider game.  It feels more like cut sequences with a little player control in between.  I realize that there are other popular games like this.  That formula doesn't work for me.

It's frustrating to have control taken away every few minutes for another cut scene or another semi-controlled falling or running away scene where it's pretty much guaranteed that you're going to die at least once if not more.  There's so much of the game where you have no chance to check out your new surroundings before you're dead.

I also absolutely hate quick time.  I never get used to it.  It annoys me in other games too.

BTW, I completed the game.  At least some puzzles showed up, but not that many for a TR game, really. This one doesn't feel like a Tomb Raider game"
1.0	Never would connect to my Wii U while official Wii controllers will One Star
1.0	You get killed way to easy in this game.  It really is no fun! STALKER
1.0	"I rarely hand out the 1 star but these headphones have failed me.  The 7.1 Surround Sound is only possible if you can get the software drivers to install.  Cruising through all the current Windows 10 forums (even though the Sades website has windows 10 specific drivers) there seems to be a significant issue with anyone's PC recognizing the headphones for the installation to complete (Windows just makes them generic pnp headphones).  And even when it does, for the few who have succeeded just get stereo sound options.

I took the advice of others and utilized these with the Razor surround sound drivers.  They work, generally well, but then I get to the sound quality.  Anything over 20% volume sounds horrible (and way too loud).  I'm not an audiophile by any means.  I was using the Logitech G35 for years before one speaker gave out and I was totally 100% happy.  My best pair of regular headphones is a set of Amazon basics over ear :P  But these sound like the external speaker of an early smart phone.  Maybe that was a consequence of the surround sound driver that wasn't intended for this product, or maybe it was something else all together, but the sound quality was very weak.

The design Is fine. I actually really like the blue lights on the side and the ear cups feel OK.  Lots of folks said they hurt their ears, mine just got sweaty.  I come from fabric ear-cups and these are leathery.

So to summarize - 1 star review is because this product is not as advertised (7.1 Surround Sound USB Gaming Headset).  There is an expectation for any gaming headset with this feature to have software to install to manage the functional but in this context that software is not functional and hasn't been for months (for Windows 10, which they released windows 10 specific drivers, providing the assumption that there is Windows 10 support).  Also this is not a defective headset, the issue i'm experiencing is well documented on forums. Surround sound not possible on Windows 10."
1.0	"The game is fine for a first walkthrough, you will get about 30-50 hours of a good expirience, the problem is that when you get games as DIABLO 3, you do it for it to last years, not some 30 hours. The game suffers from HORRIBLE itemization and Bobby Kotick's hand on it, with the stupid DRM, and the absolutly garbage RMAH, and the stupid itemization that blizzard putted, forcing players to get stuff from the RMAH.

THE GAME SUCKS, BLIZZARD sucks as a gaming company, long gone are the days of jewels like SC and BW, WC3 and TFT, and WOW vanilla and original.

Everything since ACTI MERGE has been bad, with the only possible exception being Starcraft 2, because of the extremely active and massive community iteraction that went to the game, making it the only one ""decent"" but nowhere near as good as BROODWAR. Everything else, CATACLYSM and DIABLO 3 are absolute garbage, specially diablo 3.

And the final nail in the coffin is MOP, lol, seriously ?, PANDAS !? Horrible itemization RUINS the game"
1.0	This game was meant for the PS4/Xbox One. It should have never been released for the current consoles. The graphics are horrible, the weapons are underpowered, overall...complete waste of my money. I am pissed. I wish I listened to the Gamestop employee when he told me not to get it. Worse graphics than BF3, don't get it.
1.0	"I bought this for my PS3 because of the high rating (4.5). I have read the other reviews and most mention that it is ""uncomfortable"". I actually find it too painful to wear. If I remove it from my ear canal then it is not very clear. In fact, the audio quality is poor whether it is in my ear canal or not. I also find that there is poor audio separation between the mic and the ear-piece. Every time someone else talks, I can see my mic being activated.

1.0	"UPDATE: Good news is PDP will stand behind their product, I kept my receipt and was able to get a full refund because it was still under manufacturer warranty.

After less than a month of very minimal use (10 hours of use total) the triangle button no longer works. It recognizes the button press about 50% of the time if that. Triangle button only works half of the time"
1.0	So I saw the commercial for Flight Simulator and it looked pretty cool. Reading all the reviews here on Amazon, it seems like I was one of the more lucky ones to have a smooth installation. Everything thing went well, game booted smoothly, graphics looked nice, but there are a few big major flaws to this game. First off, Microsoft took great lengths into detail, like how the baggage carts move, the gate opens, and it's almost like real life. However, your plane cannot blow up...COME ON! What ever happened to real world problems? Landing gear fails, out of gas, etc.?? All your plane does is keeps on rolling when it hits the ground. Now here's the catch. You really need to cough up the extra $$$ for a joystick to really get the MAX enjoyment out of this game. The mouse and keyboard don't cut it. Personally, there seems to be a lot of problems and it's just not what I was expecting for $50. I've only played this twice and I'm bored already. Not what I expected, plus there's a catch!
1.0	I heard that they reduced the number of servers to support online play.  My other online games play great just not this one.  Read up before buying this game, make sure to read recent reviews regarding online play.  The story mode is fine but if you like  online play then this is a pass.  Issues started just a few weeks ago.  Its not a modem issue. I loved this game but now the online play seem laggy/wonky :(
1.0	This product was defective even before I bought it. Look up reviews for this PC game elsewhere before you buy this garbage. DONT BUY!!!!!! Look up reviews for this PC game elsewhere before you buy this garbage. DONT BUY
1.0	"I have 4 xbox controllers at home. The battery pack does not work on any of them besides my black controller, the same goes for the play and charge cable. My old battery pack works on these other controllers though. This product is faulty. Also, the cable does not charge my battery pack! It just connects to my xbox without charging the pack. The only reason I decided to keep this product is because the battery pack can charge with my old charger I have lying around.

DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMENDED. Buyer Beware, does not work in every controller!"
1.0	game is not on steam yet and will not download. have fun not playing the game. sure wish i could play the game i paid for do not buy
1.0	Ok I like all game systems, so I'm not some nintendo fan boy saying this is bad just because it is not nintendo. The Playstation 2 was my favorite console and may very well still be. But the PS3 was doomed by it's own name. When your on top, there are those who say you can only go down from there, and I feel that right now this is what is going on with the ps3. I kept hearing talk of the graphics. People were talking about how amazing they would be. Often people hear this and just have in there heads that the graphics are outstanding. While the graphics do look good, you will not notice much unless you have a high deff tv. I know alot fo people have them but I choose not to spend over 1500 dollars on a tv. So unless your a person with a really great tv the graphics will not be as good as they could be. Sony cut alot of there market by doing this. You must think of every one in order to succeed. Then I hear people talking about the sound. Well once again sony took off alot of fan base with the sound. Unless you have a receiver and surround sound, you will not hear what is ment to be heard. Now to the games. From the reviews I am reading, both fans and media, there are only a few games out that are any good. I know this is how most systems are when they launch but if I am going to pay 599.99, I want gold. Every game I play sound be as amazing as the last. That is another thing. The price. I don't know how many people can just throw out 600 some dollars for a toy. I hear the 20 gig Playstation 3 was discontinued. If Sony is so secure about it's product then why would it do this. I hear that there are game companies with Playstation 3 games finished, but they will not release until the fan base grows. So even after companies spend all the time and money on the ps3 games they still will not let sony sell them. They would rather loose money. That is how low the sales of the ps3 are. The reason the price is so high is because Sony is failing in there $1000 blu-ray dvd players. So they put one in the ps3 to get people to buy dvds to use it with. Then I'm sure they think people will buy a blu-ray player. So what it comes down to is Sony is failing in psp,blu-ray,umd,and ps3 sales. I chose not to take a risk of wasting my money on something that I am not sure will stay in the industry. I'm not saying don't buy a ps3. If you want to, go for it. I will just sit here and be happy with my nes,snes,nintendo 64,game cube,wii,game boy sp, nintendo ds,ps,ps2,xbox,xbox360,plug n plays and my pc. Lemme tell you why you may want to stay away
1.0	Did not work. Disney no longer has the website for it working, but you can't log into this without the website. not worth downloading. Don't bother.
1.0	"The Sims 2 was a direct, undeniable sequel to the Sims that took everything from the base Sims game and added onto it. The Sims 3 feels much less like a direct sequel but an off-shoot of the series, more like a console version of the game but done right.

That said, considering the new gameplay experiences the game itself as a new incarnation of the Sims would be good but I can't help but feel there is much missing from the previous version.

For starters, you're buying a game with content withheld. You don't have a hot tub or even that many appealing hairstyles because EA decided to withhold these items from the game to coerce you to spend more money immediately after purchasing the game on their website. Additionally, you aren't only unnecessarily spending money for content that should've shipped with the game but you are forced to install the EA Download Manager which is how EA will infect your computer with their invasive Securom virus. While some may argue this unfair practice is A-okay, it's not, and as a consumer you should be appalled and find this absolutely unacceptable.

Secondly, the create-a-sim is extremely disappointing. Based on the ground game of S2 and S3 I found the customization tool in 2 to be far more advanced allowing greater customization. I'm sure in time as the community releases custom content we may have a greater degree of power in customizing our Sims to our likings but from the getgo I found the Sims 2 to be far superior. The only real improvement with 3 is the personalities and how we can tailor them.

Thirdly, the UI... I find the UI to be extremely tacky looking and I loathe the way the job requirements look (A smiley face, for reals?!!?). I can't help but feel EA has undermined the intelligence of those of us who play The Sims. When I first went into Buy mode I was taken aback by how the items are listed by ""room"" but fortunately you can switch to a category view, however, in Build mode you cannot... The listing of categories in Build mode is little pictures of the wall/fence/roof/etc... Very tacky and annoying and an insult to the intelligence of Sims players.

Less Realistic: Sims no longer visit the fridge to get a baby bottle, they magically swipe it from behind their back and diapers magically vanish in thin air... Rather upsetting at first but considering you can take your baby around town it makes sense (You don't want diapers all over the streets). However, you can call a repairman at any time and he'll be over within an hour. In previous Sims he'll be over the next day which is far more realistic. Children also can't call for repairs or even delivery anymore.

The graphics are far less realistic as well. I feel the Sims look very cartoony as does the entire town in comparison to the Sims 2. In 2 everything looked far more detailed and realistic where as in 3 it looks cartoony, dumbed down and far less realistic. Back to customizing your character, it's impossible to get a decently built male Sim without an oversize neck and it's impossible to get a female Sim with a proportionate bust-size without being obese, this was not the case in 2.

Overall I'm extremely disappointed in the game as I can't help but feel they took away too much. The only obvious improvement is the open town and the personalities but it certainly doesn't make up for what is missing. Also, the heinous practices of EA are unacceptable. Withholding content to charge consumers after paying a premium price (Would be okay if there was a price break in the game itself but at the regular price... No). Also, if you have to do reinstalls good luck trying to replace whatever you bought from EA's store, it's never as simple as claimed.

I would probably issue this game a 2 or 3 star rating but considering all the kool-aid drinkers that are just going to 5 star it blindly I'd prefer to even out the rating some. Nonetheless, the actions of EA easily warrant no stars or a call to boycott until it hits the sales bin.

It should also be known you can only have ONE active household in your town. You can switch to another home but it's almost like having to remove the battery from your cell phone just to switch memory cards, a hassle. You also lose wishes/promises when you switch so it's not at all as easy as it should be.

BUGS: I've experienced two freezes where I had to manually turn off my computer and one crash to desktop, all three incidents were pretty much isolated and not something I would say I fear from the game as I do believe they were attributed to a particular driver that when changed seemed to have resolved the problem.

There is an issue in sound, major issue. For one, 5.1 does not work, at least not for me. I get sound out of the three front speakers, mostly the middle, and that's it. Only when switching to stereo or using my speakers upmixing do I get ""surround"" which then sounds crappy. Also, an even greater issue, the music in Buy and Build mode sometimes does not play whatsoever which makes you feel very lonely and empty when building/decorating. An even greater issue is the sound cutting out when in Live mode. There are times when two Sims are talking and their voices just cut out and it takes some dramatic maneuvering of the camera to hear them again... It's extremely annoying.

I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs and don't believe I will as I find myself pretty bored by this game already but what I did encounter is just annoying at best and hopefully will be resolved by a patch. Not Really A Sequel, Many Disappointments"
1.0	"This Cute, Light mouse is definitely designed for MOBA games, i have been using is for dota during the last 7 months. I like its size and weight very very much. The tracking is awesome, the buttons have wonderful feeling on touch.
***************
HOWEVER, i won't recommend anyone to buy this Daedalus Prime only if you know how to DIY replace a micro-switch for this mouse. I got double-clicking problems twice on both buttons, twice during 7 months, and each time i had to ship it back to Logitech and wait for 2 weeks for a replacement. Double-clicking problem is series on this mouse.
I used to have G1, G5, G400, G100s and DeathAdder. They all could at least be used for RTS/MOBA games for at least 2 years before they got a problem. But this G302, I am done with you. DOUBLE-CLICKING problem"
1.0	I actually bought this elsewhere but want to try to warn others - this is terrible.  I tried it with Street Fighter 2 Turbo and it was useless.  The lag and the lack of input detection made fighting impossible.  I tried the same gamepad (original SNES controller) with another converter I happen to have and it worked perfectly, so it's for sure this product that's no good.  Look elsewhere! Lag makes it useless
1.0	So I finally talked myself into playing this game again, and after 3 hours I am so DONE. I shouldn't be amazed at the crap that I had to deal with but come on, really, I have to pay to have more bars on my UI. I can't open a ticket unless I am a subscriber so now I have a toon that crashes every time I try to log into him. I cant post on forums to get help unless I pay. This game is not free to play it is free to log in, walk around and site see. I should have expected nothing less then the crap the game was broken at launch and still just as broken. Even at free to play the game isn't worth it. I was hoping that things would have been better but I was wrong and at this point this is my final straw with EA I will NEVER purchase anything by EA again they have taken enough of my money and wasted enough of my time. Even at free to play the game isn't worth it
1.0	Same ol same ol. fun for a day or two just for the new maps but nothing has changed. Bored of the COD franchise
1.0	"This was a long awaited title and one of the most hyped launches of its kind ever, and for that reason I found it brutally disappointing. Its just 2-bit gangsters in LA California all over again. Somewhere new would have been nice for starters. The location and the plot is just too repetitious for a title this big! So why not change the theatre to Space, Underwater, History? I don't care, just something new! Why not be brave and even set the next game in.......China: ... The Great Wall, Leshan Park / Big Budda, Longman Grottos, Hong Kong, Shangri-la... Don't like those? Then how about Italy: Venice, Florence, Rome, Monselice, Italian Alps? Still don't like any of those? Then how about Japan or Dubai? Either way folks, treat yourselves to some travel, you definitely have the resources!

The same 2-bit characterless gangster portrayals bring few surprises either. In fact this game does no one any favours. Hello? The world has moved on! My lady has a suggestion for a change of plot. Why not use the film Taken (2008) as a base? ...Justifiable on-screen violence against bad guys trafficking women. There's an emotional angle too for anyone interested in emotioneering in video-gaming! It would be better than dumb gangsters bring cynical corporate profits! Some people might think this is unduly harsh, but the video gaming talent pool is unbelievably high. However, GTA V is more like Hollywood and its endless cycle of reboots, reshoots and sequels.

Sure, the GTA V map terrain is a little more detailed, the mountains have higher peaks, and the cars look and handle a bit better. But Driver-SF still pips it with a higher frame-rate, and Saints Row III is just more fun. The rest is just bland, bland, bland. They've long run out of ideas, much like the twin-studios that kick out Call-Of-Duty titles every year on a corporate schedule! Yes, there are 3 GTA characters to follow this time, each with their own special skill, but its so gimmicky its not even half-hearted RPG. Overall, 3 messes just make more of a mess! No thanks!

========================================
Update April 2014
========================================

To those who argue the graphics are great and that negative reviewers have never played the game...

First off the graphics aren't first rate. They were back in 2008 with GTA4 maybe, but not now! At best GTA5's graphics are an incremental improvement over GTA4, but not enough considering the long development time. There are now vastly superior open-world driving titles with better graphics such as Driver-San Francisco, and even that isn't anything new. (And no, I'm no fan of Ubisoft and their DRM from hell before you ask).

The graphics are poor in GTA5 and its because they've failed to develop their Rage engine. You can see it in the frame Rate and Rendering. During a chase scene especially, the graphics of GTA lack clarity and are more blurry than Driver-SF, and this is primarily because the frame rate is much lower in GTA, and because the rendering system lacks clarity!

Its possible there are more meshes and varying terrains and landscapes with more animations in GTA. But Driver-SF is just more clever in how it renders the scene, and ultimately this is a high-paced driving game and so clarity really matters. The game could have been improved upon before release. But I think the development team have become decadent and lazy because of past success. Also, a lot of their better developers have left, especially in Rockstar North!

I played the game for 60+ hours, so I think that counts as having played it. Yes, there's a lot to do as there was in the GTA3 series and which GTA4 lacked. But its all very repetitive and not well thought out. In short there's nothing new here, and it lacks the charm of earlier titles. For example aircraft in the game still handle poorly. And while you can steal a jet from the military base and take it for a ride, you only get seconds of fuel to go joyriding! The tanks are too slow and boring too and there's only incremental improvement in the bikes and cars. I prefer driving real cars in open-world driving games, and there's too few exotic and interesting cars in this franchise to keep my attention. Who wants to drive a Truck? This is a video game, so I want to drive a Ferrari!

Don't get me started about the AI either. Rockstar just haven't done anything new in this area. Player actions on the city are non-existent also, and this is a wasted opportunity if ever there was one.

There's a lot of swearing because the game is shallow with its never ending 2-bit gangster portrayals. The earlier series had lots of swearing too but they had more charm. When swearing exists just to hide a dearth of new ideas, that's when the series becomes stale and should be dropped. Italy?... China?... Underwater?.... Space? ... No its seedy 'LA' all over again"
1.0	I would have gave this game a zero if it were possible and I haven't even played it yet, and probably won't or can't. I had been wanting this game for awhile now and finally bought it only to be kept from gameplay by Steam Works/Valve. I know this is a good game because I bought and played the first one endlessly it was so great. But Monolith totally destroyed their product by partnering with Steam/Valve. First, Steam wants you to go on-line just to play so you go on-line. Then it says its going to update the game whether you want to update it right then or not. When it supposedly starts the update it gives you no indication of just how big the update is. It could be 5 Megs or 5 Gigs for all we know. Meanwhile, they bombard you with ads for other games eating up bandwidth as you're trying to download the update. The Steam software supposedly gives you the option to play offline but when you tell it reload in offline mode it just seems to hang up will running your cpu at 100% even after you've exited the software in frustration. You have to go to the task manager and end the process in order to shut the thing down. I'm ticked off at Amazon as well as Monolith over this. There is no way Amazon should allow it's customers to be subject to such a horrible experience as the one you will experience with software bundled with Steam. It reflects badly on Amazon. The very least they could do is post a warning to the customer. And what was Monolith thinking? Certainly not about the gamer. Pirating is not destroying gaming, the game makers themselves are destroying gaming by allowing ridiculous schemes such as this to be bundled with their products. Game makers be on notice: I will never again buy a game with Steam Works/Valve on it. This is going back to Amazon. Don't Buy!
1.0	"I had conservative hopes for this game but still, unfortunately, it was a let down.  This should of shipped as a 29.99 game.  The coop matchmaking does not perform well at all.  Hard to explain why it fails it just never really ""makes"" it.  It almost has really fun movement and skills but there isn't enough variety or reasons to be doing all of the jumping and crawling you can do.  Combat is very simplistic and even the advanced tactics are really just irrelevant unless you feel like using them for whatever reason.  As others have said, game is short and depthless.

With another 6months of design and tweaking maybe this would have made it - as it stands, ill finish the story and I highly doubt it will ever see play again.  Sad. A Miss"
1.0	"The only reason I bought an Xbox One was because of this stupid game and after 2 1/2 weeks I returned the Xbox one and selling this game on ebay because it sucks that bad. The maps are huge, everyone just camps and literally every other game hits the time limit....... Save yourself the frustrations......don't buy it!!

[...] All time Worst COD game EVER"
1.0	The charging banks for the controllers never worked.  The fans used to cool down the PS4 stopped spinning after a few months.  This product was cheap garbage. It broke within six months.  Very cheap do not waste your money.
1.0	Great One Star
1.0	This is by far the worst game I have ever played. The camera angles suck, I turned down the volume so I wouldn't have to hear my character grunt constantly. The fighting is senseless, there is no control what so ever. You just wiggle the stick and the character does what it wants. You can easily defeat enemies without looking. just stand still and wiggle the right stick. The camera is zoomed out so far that when you do have to navigate an obstacle that it is sheer luck if you are successful. I wish I could think of a horrible game to compare this to, but I just can't. If I had the choice of being made to actually suffer to the end of this game or have my pinky toe chopped off, I would chop off two toes just so I felt like I wasn't getting off to easy.  But if you don't believe me check out the reviews on any respected gaming site. I should have just paid someone 30 bucks to punch me in the face.
1.0	Game blowd Good  condition
1.0	To complicated Hate it
1.0	i got an xbox one for the soul purpose of playing dead rising 3 and titanfall, dead rising 3 made my game expierence on the xbox one amazing and titanfall just ruined my day every time I played it, this game is a cod ripoff and it definitely does not have enough content to be worth $60 (when I bought it) and then the season pass doesn't even have enough content to pay $25 for more like titanFAIL
1.0	"It looks beautiful, but you HAVE to play with others on the internet.
This would have been great if you could play it solo, but you can't. I am looking to sell mine. No Solo game"
1.0	I hate this game with an undying passion. Everything about this game is cynical, unpolished,  monotonous, unflinchingly and arbitrarily difficult, and ugly looking. This game has no polish and actively gave me a headache while playing it. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE PLANNING ON BURNING IT! Undoubtedly one of the worst and most frustrating games of all time
1.0	"Its true. First of all its not as fun as Mario party 1,2,or 3. This is not good at all. Youll probably want Mario party 1,2,& 3.
A person would probably fell disappointed If they bought Mario party 4 or even this. I think they will make a mario party 6. They dident did do a very good job with this or even mario party 4 or even this. They however did a good job with mario party 1,2,& 3. This is as lousy as mario party 4"
1.0	"I was really excited to get my hands on this newest expansion pack in the Sims 2 franchise.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations.

I'm running Windows XP with more than one gigabyte of memory, which (according to the requirements on the box) should be more than enough.  It isn't.  I experienced the worst slow-down in loading times.  Even ""Pets"" wasn't this bad!  To load the game took nearly five minutes.  To load the neighbourhood took another five.  Then it was another couple of minutes to load a lot.  I thought that my custom content was perhaps slowing things down.  So I got rid of all of it.  I didn't notice any difference.  I can't imagine trying to run this expansion pack with the recommended minimum 512 megabytes of RAM.  I'm not sure the game would ever even load.

I took my Sims on two vacations.  For the first, I took a single woman to Twikkii Island.  I noticed how slow it was right away.  With all the other Sims wandering around these vacation lots, there's bound to be a bit of lag.  I had her visit the beach.  It rained and the gameplay grew even slower.  I had her visit some ancient ruins.  The game slowed almost to a stop when she encountered a hot springs (it must've been the steam animation).  It was just too much for my computer.  Plus, each time my Sim walked to another lot, there were more minutes of loading time.

For the second vacation, I took a couple and their child to the mountain vacation destination.  By this time, the loading times were really starting to annoy me.  I only had them visit one other lot, and I made the mistake of having the mother and daughter play on the log roll.  The mother got completely stuck, and I had to look up how to free her using the debugging tool.  A search of the BBS on the official site shows that I am not the only one to experience this problem.

I didn't bother having my Sims visit the Far East destination.  By the time I got my poor glitched family back from their vacation, I'd had enough.

The developers seem to be using their customers as beta testers.  That's fine if they tell you that.  But when I buy an expansion pack for my favourite game, I don't want to have to avoid certain gameplay experiences until a patch is released.  These issues - if they are as common as they appear to be - should have been addressed before the games were finalized and shipped.

I've uninstalled ""Bon Voyage"".  I'll go back to playing with the setup I had before.  And I'll seriously think twice before wasting my money on the next piece of memory-hogging garbage that's released under the Sims 2 brand. Extremely slow and annoyingly glitchy"
1.0	Too hard to drive a simple car! You have to follow the line and still some races are too hard! They give you a random car and you have to race it and you can`t modify it. It would have been a good idea to give you a simulation test or a training stage to run all the cars or the basics. To me this game sucks!
1.0	"-ABOUT MY FORMER LOVE OF BLIZZARD-
I have bought the full version of every blizzard game ever made. I was one of the 1,000 beta testers of Diablo II. I bought the collectors version of world of warcraft and diablo 3. I WAS a fan-boy. I think the activision/blizzard merger and sloughing off of their original team has obliterated the spirit of this company.

#1 COMPLAINT -IMPOSSIBLE & CHEAP DIFFICULTY-
Diablo 3 has been a horrible disappointment for me. In hell mode, not even inferno mode, with max gear bought off the auction house, I die in 1 hit from normal mobs. I am a witch doctor. This game is supposed to be a hack and slash. Hack and slash should be somewhat laid back, even in harder difficulties, like Diablo II was. Granted it should have hard moments, but you shouldn't hit a brick wall every 2 minutes, that is if you can even get past the first brick wall. There are so many countless ways for mobs to kill you instantly. Instant death is around every corner. It makes the game a horribly painful experience. And the instant death is often quite cheap. For example a mob can pull you to them from across the screen and 1 hit you. A mob can die, and when they instantly explode on death which instantly kills you, which is especially horrible for melee classes. They can put up an impenetrable wall behind you, and a laser that rakes across you, killing you instantly. Some mobs run twice as fast as you and 1-hit you. You cannot esc quit. There are no counters to these things. It doesn't matter what your skill level is, you will die, and die, and die. In multiplayer games, players simply drop out when there are mobs like these. You will not be able to do a play-through of an act in later difficulty with the same players because death is so frequent people simply give up.

-HOPELESS HARDCORE MODE-
In hardcore mode you will be lucky to make it past nightmare difficulty. I wouldn't even consider making a hardcore mode character. In Diablo II I had a couple level 90+ hardcore's. That was the main reason I was looking forward to Diablo III, all the fun I had in tense boss fights hoping I wouldn't die with my hardcore character, but if I did starting over was still fun. With Diablo III, you die so much it's pointless to even try. It's not fun at all, just 100% guaranteed death and disappointment because you know your death will be based not on a miss-step, but on an undefeatable foe.

-CHINESE BOT-FARM AUCTION HALL-
Auto farming bots that farm gold 24/7 have already inflated auction hall prices into the millions of gold for a single item. A mob will drop around 100 gold in hell difficulty, and take maybe a minute to kill since it has to be kited so you don't get hit. So if you are a legit player, you are basically out of luck unless you are willing to pay American dollars for pretend gold from China. And blizzard gets a whopping 15% cut. Blizzard succeeded in somehow making the problem of Chinese gold farmers even worse than it already was, and also succeeded in coming off as just another sleezy game company that doesn't care about game balancing or the spirit of fair competition.

-CONCLUSION-
This is not the laid back and enjoyable hack and slash that hardcore-hell-mode diablo II was, this is a real life nightmare that you can only wake up from by not playing the game.

-AWESOME CINEMATICS-
The cinematics are awesome, watch them online. Impossible difficulty scaling"
1.0	Would give 0 stars if possible. Waste of money. My TV will not even recognize the N64. This cord is a waste of money. Waste of money
1.0	WARNING: This game DOES NOT have tag team mode in it (aka 2v2). There is no way to play WITH your friends in this game, only AGAINST them. Unlike Mortal Kombat 9 where you could play with your friends, you can only play 1 v 1 in Mortal Kombat X. DO NOT GET THIS GAME if you want it to play with other people, unless you like playing by yourself all the time. Huge Disappointment.
1.0	Does not hold a charge and constantly turns itself off. The point was that this was wireless but I have to leave it plugged in to work. Buttons stick and are fairly useless for gaming. If I could give this zero stars, I would. It doesn't vibrate and the material is cheap. I Need A Replacement for the Replacement
1.0	"Too much Bat mobile which others have already commented on.
There is a major Boss Battle late in the game which is designed to  waste your time and  frustrate the player for at least one hour(if you are lucky). It ruins the whole experience of the game mainly because you have a clunky Bat mobile that cannot be upgraded adequately to defeat the enemy which attacks in swarms. Forget being patient this battle is designed for you to lose. Even setting it at easy mode does not help.
I have purchased all three prior games and never did they get this ridiculous.
The game has been tossed in the garbage.
Shame on you RockSteady. An utter disappointment. There is a major Boss Battle late in the game which is designed to waste your time and frustrate the player for at least ..."

1.0	"Well, this sure is a disappointing game.  A few stupid and unneeded gameplay tweaks.  Fewer wrestlers.  Fewer options.  No custom music.  Graphics are the same as WWE2K14.  And, of course, the offensively obligatory DLC you have to pay for (if you are a hardcore WWE fan) that should have been in the game from the get go.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Buy WWE2K14.  It is certainly the BEST game in this series to date.  Yes, the moves are bit too fast, but the gameplay is solid, the ref does not get in the way, the targeting system is good, and the roster is INCREDIBLE!  Andre, Hulk, Bundy, Studd, Big Poppa Pump, Randy Savage, Steamboat, Jake the Snake, Mr. Perfect.  Compare it to THIS stink-fest game and you'll quickly realize how lazy WWE2K15's game-makers are.

Come on!  2K, what the heck!?!  In WWE2K15 you have NOTHING to brag about.  NOTHING.

At LEAST they should have created an awe-inspiring line-up of wrestlers from the very start of WWF to WWE today, but . . . no.  They just recreated last year's game and CUT as much as they could.  WWE2K15 is nothing but a lame money grab.  Banking on the WWE brand to lure enough poor fans into buying a poorly-made game. If WWE2K14 Vomited, You'd Get This"
1.0	It does NOT come with a hard drive bracket. This item is hard to come by are a non-online store. You'll have to buy one online. Also, the 12g hard drive can only do so much. Some videogames like FarCry 4 require a lot of space to install and then play. You'll really need an 80g and up. That's $40-80 bucks. It's now $7 hard drive bracket+ $40 hard drive+ $8 HDMI cable + $179 PS3 = screwed by Sony. Screw you Sony
1.0	Came and return ed No refund
1.0	"Simple Review here
First of you stat with a cheap cinematic showing Raynor, But the graphics on this cinematic are Really bad(like something from gears of war), nothing up the standards of blizzard CGI cinematics. The campaign starts out kinda of dull. Cant tell you anything because of Spoilers. 2nd Mission is Fun though.

The reason i gave this game 1 star is because not only does it keep crashing on my ati mobility radeon hd 5870 giving me the BSOD, IT ALSO lags online gameplay(probably my 5mbps connection which is decent for me). also this game has trouble giving my 40fps and above on 1600x900 resolution all maxed out no anti aliasing. While games like crysis run the same but gimme far more texture detail.

Worst of all is the NO LAN feature and the fact that i would have to buy a ""separate copy"" in order to play with someone else who doesnt even game as often. 3 friends on my place on my crappy internet connection=LAGFEST.

Im sure my issues will be addressed but so far im dissapointed with a game that had beta test and years of work with ""100 million dollars invested"" Which happened to be a confusion by the way, they never spent that much.

Blizzard fanboys stay away from this post, just like sony fanboys hype up their horrible game MAG and call everyone else who dislike it a ""noob gamer"" Etc. Im not a nerd aight. Worth the wait? Not for me...."

1.0	"This Harvest Moon is a truly sad addition to the series. Many of the staple options are gone (such as quick saving in midday and text speed options). Harvest Moon, as a series, already pales next to it's spinoff Rune Factory, but this game pales even further by dividing the two things Harvest Moon had going for it (Farming and Ranching) int two seperate towns so far removed from one another as to be incredibly annoying. Item handling is akwurd and difficult. (And seriously, do we really need to use up 3 storage slots each for sticks and rocks of different quality? Really?)

Despite the many Harvest Moon games I've played for years of game time, I barely made it past the midpoint of the first season before my frustration with what this title lacks (and the random freezing issues) made me give up on it. There are plenty of great Harvest Moon titles, but this is surely not one of them. If you want my advice, skip this one and buy an older DS title that was well-made (such as Sunshine Islands). Not Exactly The Best Harvest Moon Ever..."
1.0	"This game is every bit as bad as people say it is. My account was hacked while waiting for my authenticator to come in the mail! Every change they make to the game strips players of something and gives nothing in return. Lowered drop rates harder monsters and higher repair costs to name just a couple. If you find any good way to make gold they take that away with a ""hotfix"" and never say a word about the change!

It is a laundry list of problems I won't make you read an ebook the game is truly bad.

Go look at the company on the better business bureau they have 4 pages of complaints on this game alone in the north american region. They are being taken to court in framce and korea had to ban outright the sales of virtual goods.

Some info on my purchase and immediate experience. I bought the game on 5/16/2012 at the local walmart. I played the game for 4 days at which time I hit the level cap with my first character. On day 1 I couldn't even login for most of the day because of a server overload. On day 3 I heard about hacking going on and people losing accounts. I ordered my authenticator from the blizzard store for an additional cost of 6.50 bringing my total to 66.50 + tax and the shipping costs of the authenticator. By day 5 my account had been hacked and stripped of everything. My authenticator arrived days later. While waiting I contacted support and they rolled my account back. You are allowed 2 account rollbacks. The first rollback prevents your account from accessing the real money auction house until you attach an authenticator to your account. The second time they permanently ban you from the real money auction house. Fair right? Whatever this game is the worst I have seen in ages.

I also want to note that the number of players from release to now has declined from 28-29 thousand to a mere 1200 when I checked it about 15 minutes ago. Awful"
1.0	Pre-ordered the PS4, got it the first day it was released. Within the first year, the console has been in service/repair twice for different issues. Now last night the console will not stay on. Turns on for about two seconds and then shuts off. This will be the third repair which is now out of warranty. The console is in a well ventilated area and never moved. Really disappointed in Sony's product. Before buying a PS4, please look up customer reviews. Sony PS4 Quality Issues
1.0	"This game really disappointed me for several reasons,

-You drive to locations for long periods of time
-No racing whatsoever, you just compete to beat people's times in several contests
-You need online connection to play the game, which I find pathetic because I do not make online interactions
-Cars are irritating to control

Overall, I do not see the purpose of this game. I feel like I wasted my time doing senseless driving. I regret buying this, but I traded it back for a good price. I would not recommend this at all. Disappointing"

1.0	"I'm that guy that was looking forward to this game over a year ago when it was announced... Watching every trailer that was released, biting nails when the release date was pushed back, etc....

But maybe they should've pushed it back another year.

Ubisoft, determined to build a reputation similar to that of EA, just did not care when they were making this game. The other day, a friend asked me 'So, how's Unity?' and my reply was spot-on accurate, without me realizing what I was saying.

""It's a game about running around opening chests. Every now and then, you do a little bit of Assassin stuff.""

If you buy this game, and open your map, your heart will probably drop a bit at just how ugly and FULL your map is. No, it's not full of awesome things you can go do. It has, if I'm not mistaken, 294 chests to be opened, and that's not counting the ones that require you to play a giant, broken app on your phone, as well as use a giant, broken app that exists in the game itself (Initiates)

Don't get me wrong. The co-op, though glitchy as well as the rest of this rushed game, could revolutionize this series. I'm terrifed, though, that so many people are voicing how bad this game is, that Ubisoft will have typical company audacity to claim the multiplayer element is why people hate the game so much, and they'll do away with it completely... That would be bad. The only reason I still pick this game up and haven't resorted to selling it or passing it to someone else is because I can still play with my best friend. The (obviously) repetitive co-op missions and heists are irrelevant when it comes to the fact it's you and a friend now working together for a common goal. Apart from that? Give it another month, if you want this game. Maybe they'll have some issues worked out, maybe not, but I can almost promise you that the game will drop cost-wise by roughly $10-$25.

Guess that's what you get for rushing to release two totally different games on the exact same day in a one year span. Ubisoft basically crushed a devoted fan's faith and support in a single game"
1.0	Can you say cash-in? The devs changed two textures by one hundred pixels and put a 60 dollar price tag on it. If you didn't get these games when they came out and now think they're good you are a moron. I would rather a new Metro game as I played and enjoyed them when they came out. This product sucks! I played these games when they came out, why do we need them again?
1.0	Is this series still around? Why? This game gets old REAL fast and is a waste a time. I honestly cannot think of one positive thing to say about this game. The music is...nevermind. Well, the graphics are...forget I said anything. Thanks a lot, Midway. Here's a game I could have done without
1.0	I paid $10 for this and still feel like I over paid. I do have a cool looking plastic skate board with no wheels. As far as the game I've no idea what it's like. Tried multiple times at different times of the day to get this thing to calibrate. It knows when my cat skateboards on it but as far as calibrating with the game forget it. Also if you can't get it calibrated you can even forget about playing the game unless you can. Same as all the other reviews

1.0	"I have played Star Wars: Galaxies for 782 days according to the /getvet command. I have purchased all of the expansions out to date. I was considering creating a second account. As of 11-17-05 my account is cancelled. The New Game, also known as the Starter Kit, is the third version of SWG and it is riddled with bugs and incomplete. It is a far inferior product to its previous versions as well. The NG was released after being kept secret for an unknown period of time and allowing players only a two week notice of it being published. Even less time was devoted to it being tested by sources outside of SOE. Trials of Obi Wan and the NG were released in such a manner as to call into question SOE's and LA's ethics. As represented by the employees who post to the forums SOE and LA are uncarring, glib, and/or vastly out of touch with the player community.

Most of these are not new complaints. However, with the release of the NG these problems have escalted to such a degree that the game is no longer playable. While some are content to merely switch games I am not. Simply changing the direction of the flow of money to SOE and LA will not get their attention. I am boycotting all products created by Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts. I encourage others to do the same.

I do not think my actions alone with effect SOE or LA one iota. In fact, I doubt anything will change their policies. The fan base for Star Wars and other properties is sufficiently numerous to mitigate any discontent portion. While some have predicted that the NG will cause the collapse of SWG I believe otherwise. It will lose many current players but those will be replaced by SOE's and LA's new target market. SOE and LA will later use the negative comments and future subscriptions numbers to prove that they were right all along and to dismiss anyone who opposes them as being knee jerk reactionaries who are against change just because they don't like change. Because most likely the next expansion will also bring a new version of SWG as SOE and LA attempt to copy whichever game is doing better then. Boycott Sony Online Entertainment and Lucas Arts."

1.0	"Update: Software loaded with SPYWARE.

Causes just as much wrist pain as it relieves, software is pretty buggy too. Sometimes gets in the way of other game controllers and has to be unplugged. Adjustability is a 3/5, it's not that you get to adjust it, you kinda have to. The entire thumb control hub wobbles around like crazy everytime you push one of its buttons. The rubber grips are completely insufficient despite what some shill reviewers on youtube say,and this thing slides around on my desk like crazy. The lower wrist rest is a crazy dust magnet. I ripped it off, cut it up, and stuck it on the bottom so it actually stays still on my desk. Then I rolled up a sock and wrapped and tied it above the upper wrist wrest as kinda a platform so my wrist doesn't hurt so much from using it. I'll look for somethijng a lil less ghetto later on. I also have it sitting on a laptop stand which is oriented sideways, have thought of gluing it to a wooden triangle block or something. I just got this thing and it's already modded. Don't buy this unless you're a modder, period. Besides the software being buggy, it's also incredibly unintuitive and I spend more time Much more time configging in it than I should actually need to. SUPER expensive for what you're getting. Total rip-off. And the wobbly thumb control hub is NOT acceptable for a precision ""gaming"" input device. Come ON Razer, some of us need to actually win.

Buyers beware.
1.0	"Five Stars for the game fun factor if you can eventually get it loaded and bugless but unfortunately really deserves the one star overall because of the horrible, horrible installation requirements and because of many awful installation specific bugs that grossly interfere with game play.

The game itself truly is excellent, with the graphics, game play, controls all setting new standards. I personally don't like the plot and setting as much as the first Half Life and find it unnecessarily dark and depressing and I thought the ending was a little abrupt and unsatisfying, but in comparison with Doom 3 it is really a fun romp. Truly a great game.

As to the really bad part. I am a computer programmer and have half a dozen assorted computers. I spent 16 hours trying to get a working install on My new XPS with PCI express buss and 256mb ATI ultra video board. The Steam On line install system is a mess!!!! First it insists on installing Steam, then an update (over one hour on Dial up), then decrypting another hour plus. then registering and the list goes on. Then when it's done it doesn't work. I get a disk not installed message. So OK go to steam and planet half life web site and look at bug FAQs I find one that tells me if I get this message I need to uninstall my Sonic DVD driver and reinstall Half Life 2. I don't really want to remove my Sonic Driver, but I do and way and spend another four hours reinstalling Half Life. This time, up comes the starting half life 2 message, but half life 2 never comes up either on or off line. So I go back and look at the rest of the FAQs, all 170 of them, NONE of which cover my problem. I try one more remove and reinstall of Half Life 2- four more hours. Same result. Finally give up and go and install it on my old Dell Inspiron Lap top four more hours. Works perfectly Play game in standard mode and works perfectly. But wait there's more. On a hunch I try a remove and reinstall one more time on my XPS system four more hours, this time removing Steam as well as Half Life 2 first and it works fine and I play it through on Hard mode and it is HARD. You'd think I'd be done now, but no there's more. I though I'd play the redone Half Life Source through on hard mode since I'd only originally done it in standard mode and it should have been all installed when I installed Half Life 2 right, wrong , three more hours installing Half Life Source and it works, well, sort of. Each time you start the game it works fine for the first ten or fifteen minutes, then it starts taking little fifteen second breaks (picture and sound freeze) every minute or two. After another ten minutes or so, the breaks stretch to 30 seconds and after another ten or fifteen minutes they stretch to 45 seconds, eventually reach more time frozen than playing (within an hour of starting each time. I sort of recall from the FAQs that there is a fix dealing with this that is accomplished by disabling the advanced stereo features of your sound card and you guessed it reloading all of Half Life 2 and Source from scratch again, but some how that wasn't too appealing to me any more so I played it through in hard mode as it was freezes and all. Half Life Source is still low poly but appears to be substantially improved over the original Half Life and is really quite hard in Hard mode.

 Last level Half Life Source strategy. For the Nihilanth, go into the level with your rocket launcher armed and take out the 3 crystals on the wall before you are dumped to the ground then immediately run behind the spiky rock nearest the wall and snipe at fatheads head and brain till he dies. In hard mode getting hit with the white balls is equivalent to instant death and the green ball sends you to a really unfriendly space avoid them both at all costs. Skip the jump onto the ledge thing in this version.

The games are both great, but Valve has made such an utter hash of the installation procedure and of leaving in totally unacceptable bugs that they should be boiled in oil or stuck in with their own Nihilanth. They have made this mess because of getting their code ripped off last year and are making their paying customers now pay for their own stupidity then. I would really like to see a Half Life 3, but at this point, I would really prefer to see Valve go broke instead.

A final thought is skip the limited edition, it is truly not worth it. The supplied Prima Guide is a joke only covering the entry to the game and is really an add for Prima guides I wouldn't use one anyway and the supplied shirt is uninteresting in the extreme. The DVD ROM Version is the only thing of value that is supplied and it isn't worth thirty bucks more than the CD version. Best FPS Ever Horrible Install Very Buggy"
1.0	"I've been playing Atari games for nearly 3 decades, and I have to tell you - there's no way that anyone with more than a year's worth of programming experience lent any effort to this title.

This game is horribly broken.  Terrible driving mechanics, passable graphics at best, a completely worthless club system, and much, much more stands between Test Drive Unlimited 2 and anything worthy of being called a ""massive online racing game.""

With only about 8 hours of playtime under my belt here, I'll admit that I'm going to hold out for some repairs (not patches - flat out repairs) to be made, and hopefully things will get better.  But the cars drive like air balloons, the trucks are actually somewhat decent...  The graphics are gorgeous inside the dealerships, but in the open-world environment of TDU2, we're subjected to Grand-Theft-Auto car detailing, such as octagonal-shaped steering wheels, clipping, and terrible anti-aliasing.  Match that with driving physics that tries to mix something like Ridge Racer and slot-cars, complete with unpredictable drifting, a ""forward to reverse, reverse to forward"" that literally gets STUCK, and you've got TDU2.

The worse travesty is the part of the game which TDU2 centers on - the online interaction.  Weeks before the game released, the TDU2 forums were alive with people starting their clubs, recruiting members, and anxiously awaiting the game.  Now released, a majority of gamers who have tried to create their clubs have had frozen screens and corruption of their file-saves.  Once recovered (by unplugging the internet, rebooting, and moving to a different spot on the map) these users discovered that their clubs either didn't exist, or existed but were unmanageable.  All attempts to access the club area of TDU2 results in a frozen game.

Add in the fact that you can't (easily at least) sell cars, the ""custom"" options are extremely limited, the photo and graphics editors are total jokes, and it becomes safe to say that TDU2 is the first colossal let-down of 2011.  Don't worry, Atari - there is plenty of time left for someone to suck more than you...

It's unspeakable to pay this kind of money and be presented something still well within the stages of beta-testing.  It's an insult, and I strongly suggest that gamers stay far away from this title until these issues are resolved (IF they get resolved...)  Stay tuned to this review - I'll do my best to keep it updated.

*******
First revision (keep up the negative votes, fan-boys.  I don't really care.)

Three days since release and the online components still aren't working.  Newest issue I have - the game won't even load past the opening menus.  I've again had to unplug the internet to get the game to load.  (Yes - the ONLINE RACING GAME works best when you DON'T use the internet...)

Complains on the TDU2 forums are reaching a fevered pitch.  I'd suggest stopping there if you're still considering purchasing this title.

As far as gameplay goes, the game is still fun, if not a bit too easy (read my response to one of my laughable comments below.)  AI doesn't really try at all, and you'll only lose a race if you mess up.  Of course, the physics don't help much.  I've grazed a wall at a high speeds to be viciously spun 360-degrees without reason...  At least it left me pointing in the same direction.

Still hoping I can get my club going, as online support is actually quite high.  Stay tuned...

*******
Second Revision

I'm glad to see that the average star-count for this game is dropping.  About time people start recognizing the reality.

One week after release now and several of the bugs have been fixed.  A freeze on load-up has been fixed and online play seems to be stable.  However the club function is still not working - they keep bringing the ""club server"" online only to find more problems that need fixed.

And another nasty bug persists - people getting ""your game is corrupted and you have to start over again"" messages.  In fact, even I've fallen victim to this now, after 50+ hours of gameplay, winning a car in the casino (which is NOT easy to do) and driving every road in the first island...  ...I have to start over again.

Except that I won't.  This game is probably getting returned.  I've dropped my review to 1 star - this game is essentially unplayable.

If you want a ridiculously easy single player campaign with graphics a few years behind their times with pathetic voice acting - all bundled up with iffy driving physics and the overlying possibility that you could lose hours and hours of effort for no reason whatsoever, by all means, pick up Test Drive Unlimited 2.  At some point you'll be sure to regret it! Bugged and Broken Beyond Reason..."
1.0	There is no excuse for censorship This is so sad
1.0	"I weep.

It's hard to believe how EA can purchase a thriving studio, and drive it into the ground title after title and not care...
It's a good thing it's easy to sell mindless, horrible great looking sports games to their tasteless herd of witless fans.

Classic EA formula in place here:

+ more graphics
+ more action
+ we need drm for our crappy game no one is going to want to play
+mass appeal since we are HUGE and have no concept of a fan base

- fun...no, let's focus on graphics instead of game play and plot
- strategy...you guys are also on the graphics team!
- ignore all existing fans
- C&C in title only

Why do modern devs believe that every single game has to have more action!?
Not everyone is looking for an action fix.  Do devs/designers not own TVs?  I can cut my TV on and get my fix 24/7.  How about quality game play, and a little thing called strategy...isn't that what built the genera?....

Oh, and avoid this game. Classic EA"
1.0	"I was expecting this game to blow me away because of all the hype and extremely positive reviews. The reality is all those positive reviews were from fanboys because this as mediocre as mediocre gets. The biggest disappointment from the PlayStation 4 yet and that's saying a lot.  I guarantee that most people will actually get bored while playing this game.  If you thought  ""The Order 1886""  was a disappointment  just wait utill you play this. Absolutely do not buy this game, instead rent it. It's barely worth the rent but at least you won't blow money on buying it because it is not worth it.  Only extreme fanboys should get this game because nobody else will think it's any good. The most overrated game ever made."
1.0	I bought them fgiuring that thye would be good spaers but there junk!! I play call of duty and I though that my screen was spazing out only because of internt conection, but once i got the higher qualty $20 ones the wii worked fine!!! THEY SUCK!!!
1.0	"This game is a HUGE step backwards for the PGA Tour series.  First, the gameplay is actually decent and the courses look better than ever, but that is where the positives end.  Simply put, there is NO CONTENT here, thus the title of the review.  EA is trying to sell you this game lacking content severely for $60!  There are only 8 real courses, no Augusta, which isn't even the biggest fault.  No, the biggest fault is the career mode.

This is the biggest insult EA has thrown at us with this game: career mode.  First the character creation is absolutely GOD AWFUL.  Like, this creation system belongs in the PSOne/N64 generation.  This is simply unacceptable today, and especially in a game that is touting creating your own golfer!  There is no customization really, no gameface, and ultimately, the models look HIDEOUS!

Look, is the game fun to play?  Yes, I will admit it.  But there is NO CONTENT WHAT SO EVER here.  EA has the balls to charge $60 for a $30 value.  Then they will add DLC in the future where we can shell out $8 per course.  No thanks.  Do yourself a favor, get EA Access if you want to try this game and save yourself $55. This game is an attempt at highway robbery by Electronic Arts."
1.0	"I am really disappointed in this game.  I bought it based on reviews, and the reviews seem to be inaccurate.  I was hoping to something similar to Princess Isabella, but it was not nearly as good.  Unfortunately I can't return it for full price because it was opened, snd now is ""used"" Sorry I bought this!"
1.0	Very bad,only 1 month and...out ! Five Stars
1.0	"Square dropped the ball with this title.  A waste of time on so many, many levels.  An uninspired journey into boredom.
The combat system is... not bad.  Interesting.  Different, yes. If the gameplay were even remotely interesting, the combat system would push this into the highest echelon of rpg's.
Thing is, the gameplay is *horrible*.  Boring, boring, boring.  There's no animations worth dealing with, everything is 2 dimensional flat cutout images in a pseudo 3-dimensional world.  Exploration is boring.  Interaction is boring.  Everything, in fact, aside from the battle system is... boring.
The battle/combat system alone isn't enough to save this game.  Terrible.  Don't waste your time or your money. An utter disappointment..."
1.0	"You know, one does not take a look a kart-racing game starring M&Ms created by the rather-unreliable  DSI Games and expect it to be among the very best the Wii could ever offer, and it may also have been released back in 2007, but considering the many quality games released over the years and even what the Wii started out with, surely this could be a little decent distraction for the inner kid or if the player's bored or anything along those lines. Maybe it could even be a guilty pleasure if it did suck. But no. This game is something else entirely. It's so fiendishly terrible that for this review, I think I'll just try and have fun beating this one down to death. After all, that would be more fun than actually playing this game.

M&Ms Kart Racing is the very definition of Wii shovelware. I bet if there was a video game dictionary, and if you searched for ""Wii shovelware"", it would say ""M&Ms Kart Racing............also known as M&Ms Racing Team"". Hang on, game; which is it? The packaging and banner icon says ""M&Ms Kart Racing"", but the game calls itself ""M&Ms Racing Team"". Was there so little connection between the developers that they couldn't decide on a singular name? This is also a problem with the amount of tracks the game has; the packaging says there's ten, but the actual game has fifteen. It probably would've been great if this game got popular when it came out; that way, someone could sue the publisher for false advertising and possibly have the game recalled from existence.

Naturally, the game manages to understand racing games usually have single-player and multiplayer modes, but it does a fantastic job of mucking that up as well. One-player modes consist of Tournament and Arcade. Tournament is not a tournament, but a marathon of all the tracks where you race against CPUs. Arcade is the exact same thing, except you collect coins and fortunately only have one lap to complete these abominable excuses for tracks.

Each and every track is a bland, featureless gauntlet that was likely not meant to be in a kart-racer about M&Ms. I would know because some of the tracks featured very small and confined areas that are absolute hell to drive through at a decent speed. Luckily for us, M&Ms Kart Racing Team decides to rig the framerate when things start looking too fun! The framerate, combined with the Nintendo 64-like draw distance, can be absolutely disgusting and slow the already boring pace down, but it does make voice clips like ""APPROACHING SOUND BARRIER"" all the more unintentionally hilarious. I do feel bad for the tracks, though. Maybe they should be reused as assets for a better game so they don't have to be stuck in this atrocity.

Appropriately enough, the game can be just about unwinnable when approaching the later tracks (should you really want to play up to that point to begin with). In Tournament, the very last track is when the AI finally decides to actually grow a pair and be more challenging, but a couple of them move so fast, you're guaranteed to lose the race. And you HAVE to finish in First if you want to move on to the next track. Apparently, the way to rectify this is by unlocking a better car via spending a large amount of coins you find along the tracks. The Arcade mode is the way to do this (as well as coins in Tournament), but then it turns out that mode is unwinnable PERIOD! I swear to God there's 31 coins on the second space track, but the game wants me to collect 33 on it. Are you kidding me?! Where are the other two coins?! I looked everywhere on this super-linear track and results were fruitless every time! Regardless, the mode probably ends the same way the Tournament mode does: By cutting straight back to the main menu, not even having a credits roll or ending image. ""APPROACHING SOUND BARRIER!!!!"""
1.0	Broken Broken
1.0	"When I followed the instructions and placed the filter on the bottom-screen, my 3DS stopped working at the home screen. The touch pad wouldn't respond, and none of the buttons did anything (except A to start the game). I assumed I had damaged my system, but after taking off the filter it worked again.

I kept the top screen on, but I'll probably remove it soon, it has too many air bubbles that won't escape on their own, and I did everything according to the exact instructions. When I followed the instructions and placed the filter on ..."
1.0	"This guitar controller, as all of the Guitar Hero controllers, suffers from one problem that hasn't yet been fixed: Loose fret buttons. They required some breaking-in on the original Guitar Hero 2 white XPLORER guitar controller, but over time, even though the frets have changed slightly, problems with buttons not reading as being held down continues to be the biggest problem. I suppose it can really be blamed on the construction of the controller itself. The buttons wiggle in their holes. They aren't loose like about-to-fall-out-of-the-guitar loose, but it means you might pinch the edge of a button thinking you have it pushed down, and then you go to strum the note and you miss it. It's incredibly frustrating for someone like me. I play on Expert, and am constantly trying to better my score. And when you can't trust the controller you're using the fun is immediately sucked out of the game for me.

The strum bar is the other way that this guitar controller fails miserably. For me, anyways. I play left, and so I technically play the guitar upside down. Maybe as a righty it isn't so bad, but to play this guitar as a lefty, when I down-strum, you have to push it nearly to its stop in order for the guitar to register a strum. So if I'm playing, but the notes aren't coming down the track fast enough that I would need to use up and down-strums, I have to shove the strum bar all the way down every time. It completely ruins the fun of playing, and I'm sure only ruined the strum bar on the guitar further.

Now in fairness, I let my brother use this one when we played Rock Band since he's right-handed, and  the strum bar seemed to work fine for him. But since I'm lefty, I really can't give this any higher a rating. Oh it has a detachable neck and a two-color sunburst. Well congratulations, but I'm getting tired of these guitars being all glitter and no grit. It can't stand up to someone who needs to use this to seriously PLAY it. Imagine using a regular XBOX 360 controller to play a game in which you use A, B, X and Y equally, but one of the buttons sticks and the right joystick only works sometimes. It would immediately take all the fun out of playing the game.

The detachable neck is my final complaint and the final straw for me. Quite a few times while I was playing through World Tour (which is a fine game, aside from this awful controller), the game would suddenly stop reading any of the notes I was playing. After a few times I realized it was because when you lock the neck into place it still slides a little, so you have to be careful when you're playing not to pull the neck away from the body. Honestly, the construction was so poor here I don't know what they were thinking. Spend the extra money and just go with a Rock band controller, or like me, stick with the white XPLORER guitar controller. Nearly complete failure"
1.0	I probably have over 100 PC games that I have purchased through the years starting with Myst and ending with this one and ME2. If you liked the first one you'll probably like this except for the additional stuff like a NON-TRANSFERABLE LICENSE CODE. When I installed the game I was told the install code I entered was permanently attached to my GFW Live account and non transferable. This is on top of the other stuff that has been complained about. My take on this is they just killed the used PC game market for Bioshock 2. This offends me and helped me decide to never purchase another PC game that requires Games for Windows Live, non transferable license codes, or an always on internet connection like C&C4 will require. I think if PC games are moving toward this type of anti-piracy nonsense it's time to call it quits. There is a very disturbing trend in DRM that really does punish the honest people and seems to energize the pirates every time they crack a new game. This one was cracked the day it was released. It really is too bad 2K took a beautiful and fun game and ruined it like this. I guess I'll just wait for the used console games from now on. Good game but be aware...
1.0	"The Dreamcast version of Spiderman is UGLY and that is an understatement. The cut scenes are ugly the graphics are lacking especially for Dreamcast game and the game is EXACTLY the same as the Playstation version. If you played the PS1 vesion then stick to that and forget about this. Many people gave this a high score but take my word DON'T LISTEN. I did and wasted my money on this crap!!!
Spidey deserved better on Dreamcast...what a disappointment1!! SPIDEY DESERVED BETTER"
1.0	Can't unlock other islands with the the rain. Even though the ENTIRE map shows discovered!! WHAT A RIP OFF. Nice graphics, but you can't unlock other places because the map says discovered but just ughhhhhh
1.0	The build quality is improved and no longer squeaks and creeks when held, but the LB/RB buttons have been terrible on both the original and replacement controller I received. Still bad.
1.0	"I won't bore you with my experiences with the previous titles. If you bought this title, then you are obviously a fan. However, this particular title was a huge disappointment to the franchise!  Here are the reasons why:
- Clumsy gameplay and control: the controls are defiant and will send your avatar to do things that you never intended to do. Nine times out of ten, I was discovered by the enemy for just that reason. The fighting controls are impossible to get used to and the camera angles were frustrating.
- Sorry storyline: if you're a history-buff like me, you were probably interested on how this version of the story (regarding the American Revolution) would unfold. I can usually follow a storyline and piece two and two together. However, the cut-scenes usually left me clueless as to what's going on. The concept was interesting but the execution of said story was not well thought out. It was as if the story was written by a child who couldn't figure out how to transition one cutscene to the next.
- Boring:  As if its a never-ending road one would travel in hopes to, someday, get to the punch-line. Nevertheless, the gamer would find themselves bored and aggravated. A story should play with the emotions of the audience (happy, sad, shocked, intrigued and thirsty for whatever is next). But it's more like, ""see spot. See spot run.""

Conclusion: if you are into a pointless story that can only be interpreted with a simple phrase known as, ""WTH"", then go for it. Be prepared to be frustrated due to ridiculous excuse of gaming control.

My opinion: If I could give it an eight of a star, I would. Shame on you, UBI! Horrible!"
1.0	"Man, I never knew Phil Regis could be this ANNOYING!  Since some of the first few questions are ludicrously hard (which is totally unlike the show), and it gives you 30 seconds to answer the question (which is ALSO  totally unlike the show), I have to restart the game A LOT, which means I  hear Phil Regis A LOT.  A ""skip"" button should've been put into  the game!  I haven't recieved any repeat questions after about 3 months of  owning the game.  How?  I uninstalled it after 30 minutes and never played  it again!  Trust me, you'd get more fun out of an electronic whoopee  cushion than this game...and it's $5 cheaper! Doesn't Regis ever SHUT UP!"
1.0	This game stinks! I am real disappointed!!! Activision is throwing out anything to make a buck without thinking of gamers Don't Buy
1.0	"Game is very disappointing.

Storyline:  Where can I begin since there is no coherent story in the game.  You never get a clear picture from star to finish.  Whenever story comes up it ends so fast before you can take in what just happen.  Like the beginning with Starkiller getting a lightsaber from his prison cell?  Why is there a lightsaber in his prison ( he is a force user).  Why did Vader revive or clone Starkiller when he got beat down by starkiller?  He could have taken down Sidious with Starkiller but refuse to do so in TFU1, so why would he bring him back?

Graphics: Very nice.  Only good part of the game.

Gameplay: Pretty decent but gets old fast.  You get your abilities way too fast and you do nothing new down the line.

Length:  Very short game.  This could be a plus since I couldn't wait to finish it.  It was hard to keep playing it.

Characters: Horrible.  Starkiller is the worst character to come into Star Wars since Jar Jar Binks.  He has nothing that he brings to the lore other than nonsense.  Starkiller has no personality, accomplishes absolutely nothing but dying or crying that he isn't with his girlfriend.

Overall: Boring game.  All the force powers in the world can't make this game exciting. Force is not strong with this one."
1.0	This is just standard flash memory in a proprietary format.  Nothing special, yet it's triple the price of flash cards in the standard format (SD). The argument that price shouldn't be a factor in how you review a product is absurd.  The amount you pay for a product absolutely affects how you expect it to perform, whether you're talking about cars, electronics, or just about anything else.  I just bought a pair of Pioneer floor standing speakers for 100 each, and I do not have the same expectations that I would for $300 Polk speakers, for example. Price matters.
1.0	I can't believe I wasted my money on this game. Even though I beaten the game. But it just pathetic that it had no items such the shield item,speed item or any other items. The best sonic game I like is sonic unleashed. Not as awesome then I anticipated.
1.0	"I admit I have relatively high standards for FPS shooters. I play all sorts of them (and have played them for the better part of a decade) including TF2, HL/HL2, Quake (1-4), Unreal (every single one), and all sorts of off shoots (absolutely LOVE COD4 right now...stop reading this and go buy it if you haven't already). My disclaimer is that I didn't play much farther than maybe 30-40 minutes...you'll understand why in a second...

That said, I can't believe this game was even published. I'd seen previews and read about this coming out (granted, some of that came in the form of newsletters from codemasters) so I was hyped a bit. I'd switched from COD2 to COD4 when the latter came out so I hadn't played a WWII-themed shooter in a little bit and I was getting twitchy...

I tossed this in the dvd drive and installed it then ran the puppy to find a standard-issue console port, complete with no mouse support in the menu system (huh? I'm a programmer and it always boggles me how it seems so hard for them to add mouse support to the menu system...the rest of the game supports a friggin mouse!), checkpoint saves, and lousy graphics. Even the control scheme sucked...I felt like I was running (I was running) through molasses.

The graphics were dated...they reminded me of medal of honor...from five years ago.

There is no such thing as a headshot since even with a nicely aimed shot to the head, it took three or four shots to take down an enemy (I know you're trying to make it hard but c'mon...). At least if it was to the chest or leg or something I'd deal with it better but really.

Loads of immovable objects (must have used a lot of superglue or something) and a complete rails experience (no choices...just one way to go through each level).

Put all together, you've got a game that either needed another year of development work or one that should never have been published and written off as a loss. Do yourself a favor and save your money for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty-4-Modern-Warfare/dp/B000TTFLS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>&nbsp;or better yet, get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Orange-Box/dp/B000PS2XES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Orange Box</a>&nbsp;and get three games and to expansions for the price of an expansion...

Been playing since 2003. Love Sims classic. Luckily skipped Sims 2. Yes you can play Sims 3 but I do not spend time gaming just to have my work go POOF. It is a SCAM if you cannot save your game EVERY TIME. I've been battling this save bug and a ton of other BUGS. With all the other games out there, I'm shopping elsewhere. There is a reason EA Games won Worst Company In America History TWICE! Game is no fun, Too many bugs!"
1.0	Cheap and didn't last the month. Second one purchased. Now purchasing three of the original WII remotes. These do not stand up to the boy play of my sons. Took over a month to arrive. Won't be wasting anymore money on these knockoffs. Hate this product
1.0	Didnt last long. One Star
1.0	Basically... This game sucks. The graphics suck, the dialog is boring, this title is overrated. I sold my copy to some idiot on eBay and I get a negative review because it sucks so bad. I rather play with a barbi than play this POS. There needs to be an option for 0 (ZERO) stars.
1.0	"So after the success of Batman Returns, there would be a movie adaption of Batman Forever.  The graphics looked interesting.  Almost a next gen feel for the SNES.  And it would be a brawler.  So how could it go wrong?  Well first off, it feels like they are trying to rip off Mortal Kombat.
But the worst sin is that the controls are horrendous.  They are so frustrating.  I remember spending most of my time mashing buttons just trying to get my grappling hook to work.  Still brings up bad memories all these years later!
The story is fine.  And it is a good challenge in game play.  But its never a good game where the main challenge is the broken controls.  Game better left lost to the sands of time. Possibly Worse Than The Movie!"
1.0	Product is.. very poorly made. Time delay on all buttons and sticks. One Star
1.0	I am not sure why but it didn't download correctly. I love the twisted lands games and have played all but this one. Me and the kiddos are playing it now but getting it to load is a pain in the butt! Didn't download right...

Don't bother. Bleh."
1.0	After a year or two the rubber starts to peel off and Steel Series will not replace your mouse. Garbage mouse and garbage company. Garbage mouse and garbage company
1.0	The developers actually stated that they released the game so they could use that revenue to complete it.  Wow.  Just wow.  Every Star Trek fan just got spit in the face as far as I'm concerned.  This MASSIVE world feels like you're floating around in an area the size of a toilet bowl with other turds.  People were lvl capped within days of release and there is virtually no content.  Of course there are some losers that go against the grain and will tell you it doesn't suck...but those are the people that pick the opposite of popular opinion strictly because they think it makes them an individual.  It took me about a day to realize that this game is a joke. Probably won't be an expansion and won't be around by xmas. Broken Unfinished and Waste of Money!
1.0	"This game is a huge step back in the CoD franchise. I skipped Ghost so I can't compare to that but compared to Black Ops II, AW is just awful. The EXO Suit takes center stage in this series and for me it really hurts the game. Each map is built around the suit and the gameplay with the suite is more frustrating than the innovative fun that I believe was the goal. I guess if you like skeet shooting you'll enjoy this.

You know how every single CoD has those maps that are super fun and memorable? Those maps you hope that pops up so you can vote on it? Those maps you can call your favorite? Yeah, AW has none of those. Every single map is a bland mess.

Maybe I'm just tired of getting shot in the back for the last 10 years, but like the rest of you who are let down, I'll try again next year, but if the EXO Suit is back next year, I will not be. Lame. The EXO Suite is lame. The maps are simply boring and unmemorable."
1.0	"Yes the game is playable.  Yes it is visually stunning.

No you can not play the game off-line.  The Multi-player functionally is questionable there is no true interaction with other players.  Some players have short attention spans and abandon their cities quickly, leaving regions with only 1 or two active players, which further lessens the value of the Multi-Player setup.

Personally I was hoping for an improved version of Simcity 4 rush-hour, this is an upgrade of Simcity Social.  Completely disappointing and a total waste of money. Fails to live up to previous versions"
1.0	"This game is overhyped.  Been playing RTS since Dune 2, Age of empires, StarCraft, etc. It's been such a long time since a good RTS came out, was expecting this game to be the game of all time.

Bought a super gaming computer, even a 2nd monitor, got the game, installed it, played for 30 minutes, then the DVD is now used for wall decoration, and the DVD box is used as a window stopper.

The good -
1.  I now have a very powerful computer.
2.  The DVD box was the perfect size to be used for my window stopper.  Very sturdy made.

The bad -
1.  3 identical races.
2.  Zoom in is pointless in actual playing, only good for seeing how powerful your computer is.
3.  Story, well never got into it.  The gameplay was so boring, couldn't even keep my attention span over 30 minutes.
4.  Didn't even want to bother selling it back to a local retailer, don't want other gamers to get buy this junk.
5.  typical Bad RTS - no strategy at all.  Build up the units, attack, destroy all.  Forget micormanage, forget counterunit, a bigger army always wins. Huge dissapointment, wasted buying a super gaming computer"
1.0	Received package in perfect condition, yet when i opened the box the game was severly damaged. Damaged product

1.0	"Bought this game on the packaged bundle with DA2 for $12.50 because the bargain was too good to be true. Turns our you really get what you pay for. It was my first (and last) game download purchase from Amazon. They had a chance to pull me away from Steam and failed. Your experience may vary as one can see from reading all the reviews on this game (for some people it works flawlessly, others encounter issues too numerous to list). I hope Amazon will not edit my review and at least 1 or 2 poor souls looking to get the game they paid good money for to work can make use of my experience described below.

The game file is big and aware of that, I downloaded it from work. Download speed there is faster and instead of taking days (meaning pauses to download etc...) I could get it done in a couple of hours while leaving the PC (docked and wired connection) behind for meetings. So I did try to take precautions given the numerous reviews mentioning file corruption.

Back at home I try to install the game and it fails with the least informative error message ever ""DA:O failed to install"" and some generic ""Why don't you try again?"" kind of suggestion for a fix. So I make sure I go to task manager and kill every possible task I can and try again, this time keeping an eye on the boring install window to try to catch the issue. At around 70% of the install it hangs up and I was quick enough to capture a screenshot. So I found my corrupt file. In my case it was ""addins\dao_prc_ep_1\core\env\vgk200d\vgk200d_1216.gpu.rim"", yours may be different. Shortly after the hang up the failed install message showed again.

Wondering if anything went wrong with the download I decide to try again. Deleted all files from the PC and downloaded even a fresh Amazon installer, 2 days later I have a new file to try again. Did not work. The install failed again and *on the exact same file*. This is important because I would think a file corruption from the download process would be random. The fact it failed at the exact same file makes me wonder if Amazon is not just selling a corrupted game.

I then proceeded to try fix it myself, since I read enough about the lack of helpfulness from EA and Bioware in technical issues from both Amazon and other forums. And I wanted to avoid getting on EA's bad side since there are instances where even bans from forums locked people out of their games.

Forums did not help much. A lot of people mentioned ""fixing the corrupted files with good ones"" and I kept wondering ""Where did they get these so called good files""? Others suggested using Origin. I refuse to install it on my PC on principle (you could say I'm a Steam fanboi) so not an option (I must point out I would have broken down and installed it if I had not been able to fix it any other way).

How I actually fixed my issue: using Google and WinRAR (which has just converted a free trial into a purchase). I googled the file name of my corrupted file. Needless to say, the results are less than savory sites. I was not worried about breaking any law since I legitimately purchased the game, but virus/spyware are always an issue. Given I have firewall, anti-spyware and anti-virus installed I took the jump. And in the process I found out that I did not only have a corrupt file. There were at least 3 dozen files missing from my install folder (the unsavory site I used placed the files neatly into the correct paths so it was easy to see things were missing). I had to download these missing files one by one and make sure I got the folder path correct for each fie. I then used WinRAR to patch the downloaded files into the main corrupted RAR file (if you are wondering about free alternatives, 7-Zip at least will NOT work, I tried). I scanned all files for virus before doing the patch, for precaution.

Crossing my fingers I tried the install again and it worked! So now I'm able to play the game and hopefully it is good and makes me not regret going through so much trouble to get it working. By the way, EA's activation methods for both the game and the DLC are a pain in the backside. Not streamlined at all. I don't mind DRM, but if you want to do it, make it easier on the people who paid for your product.

A few last comments, mostly to Amazon:
1. You have the money to develop a download manager that checks for file integrity before jumping into the installation and can try to patch any issues if there is a problem. So do it! Games are only getting bigger and file corruption issues can only get worse.
2. Do check the file you are selling. Maybe it was EA/Bioware that gave you a junk file to upload, but either way, you are the one selling it so make sure it's in good condition. Buyer beware, you may not be able to even install the game"

  It's most of the time the same exact guy you killed before so it's extremely repetitive. Now as a fan of mafia 2 I say mafia 3 stepped it up with the story but stepped it down with the gameplay. Here's the truth about this game..."

Within a month or so both controllers died completely.

I contacted seller they were very gracious and replaced both of them for free no problem. Even overnighted them.

I can no longer recommend this controllers.

It's wonderful they give you some type of neoprene grip covers. Feels weird and bulky to me but the fact they give it to you free of charge is great!

Connects easy and so far doesn't have that ""move around on it's own"" problem other companies have with their controllers. Pretty sweet deal"

1.0	Doesn't work on Samsung LED TV. Waste of money. Waste of money
1.0	Unfortunately this review has nothing to do with the gameplay, which I was very much looking forward to. However my 1-star review comes from the fact that my PS4 will not read this disc. It reads every other game in my collection but will not read this copy. Must have got a dud or something, will have to look into getting a new copy and returning this one. Can't play
1.0	"Stay away from this game. Not worth $60. No single player and little to no content MP. Graphics looks like a polished 360/PS3 game. ""Oh but graphics don't matter if you have great gameplay""  Gameplay is pretty bad as well. Let the greedy publishers know, we don't want less content for more money. Stay away. Make a stand!"
1.0	"Unlike previous sim games, you cannot directly control one family at a time. If you create one family, play it for a while and then save and play another, when you come back you will find that they have continued to age in your absence and that all your hard work that you put into making a particular sim is gone because he died from old age. It is really a big letdown.
If you want to make new neighborhoods, you are out of luck, as you are stuck with one, and you are forced to BUY others if you want more.
There is just no reason to remake this game, and it feels like EA just wanted to be able to remake all of those expensive expansions for it again so their CEOs can afford their weekly trips to the Bahamas.
It is also extremely buggy, and will crash quite often.
The lack of loading screens is good, but it just doesn't make up for everything else that is wrong with this game. Worse than previous sims games"
1.0	"I got this game for just $4 off Amazon.com with high hopes for a Super Nintendo baseball game.

Wow.  Terrible isn't even a strong enough word to describe this mess.

This reminds me of so many movie video games which slap the name on their hoping kids would buy them but the actual game is horrible.

First off, the graphics on this game are just atrocious.  Play a game like Super Bases Loaded, a VERY early release for the SNES, and you'll see just how superior a baseball game it is.

Another major problem:  Because I believe Tecmo had the MLB rights back during this time, the only REAL player you get in the game is Ken Griffey Jr.  Everyone else are a bunch of false names.  That might work for you but it's a little misleading when you see Ken Griffey on the cover only to not see the players on your favorite team.

But what really just BREAKS this game is the actual gameplay.  You literally cannot control your pitching outside of the speed.  Making a ball curve?  No way.  Though the computer has no problem. :)  Batting and fielding are just about as bad.  As I mentioned in the title, you get a FAR better experience with games like Baseball and Baseball Stars for the originaly NES then you will ever get with this game.

If you want a much deeper baseball experience, I recommend MLB Power Pros for the PS2, it can be had for around $5-10 bucks, and trumps games like this easily.

For the SNES, Baseball Simulator 1.000 is pretty much the standard bearer on the system IMO for a baseball game.  Super Bases Loaded also is a much better game.

Save your $4 and just pass on this one.  You will be glad you did. Wow.  Even plain Baseball for the NES is better than this!"
1.0	"I ordered this using a gift card I received for christmas and was anxious for it to arrive. The thought of having 2 wii remotes ready at all times without having to replace batteries was a nice thought.

Well, a few days later the initial charger arrived, I un-boxed it and found the metal prongs on charging stand #2 were bent and would not allow a remote to charge in slot #2, slot #1 worked just fine... I did the return process which was very easy and that same day Amazon shipped out a replacement order.

Yesterday I received the replacement unit, everything looked fine. I hooked it up and put the batteries in as directed and let the system charge for 24 hours. The lights turned from orange to green which meant the controllers were charged so I tried to play a game this morning... I used controller #1 and as soon as I started pushing buttons the controller powered off. I had to keep hitting the ""A"" button to get the remote to keep turning on then pressing ""1"" to get the first player to work.  That wasn't working, every 10 seconds the controller turned off...

I never tried controller #2, I figured #1 wasn't working I wasn't about to keep the charger at this point so I returned the second unit in the mail today... This was not a successful venture and I have since put the standard AA batteries in and have played many games successfully with those. I know my controllers are good, this had to be another defective unit. 2 defective units received?? Really??"
1.0	"This game says its an action/adventure game but I say its adventure game emphasis on adventure. Some people say that its short but its long. It is called ""dreamfall: the longest journey"" for a reason. All I've done is ""Talk to one person and talk to an other person, walk over here, walk over there, blah blah blah"". In a game you should be playing it not just mindlessly moving a joystick. This should have been either a book or a movie 'cuz this is not worth a penny to be video game! But if you like adventure games you should get this 'cuz thats ALL IT IS! Should have been a book or a movie it would have been better that way!"
1.0	Had this game from day one, and maybe have gotten 4 hours total in. Blizzard servers suck, and keep kicking you off. You have to be online to play single player. you can be right in the middle of doing something, and if there is a problem with a server it kicks you out, screw blizzard, i still like diablo 1 on the playstayion, and diablo ii v1.12 where i can play offline, whenever i want. anyone looking for a new diablo like game look into TORCHLIGHT!! it is from the creators of Diablo 2, and it is only $20 for TORCHLIGHT 1, or $20 to preorder TORCHLIGHT 2. the game is offline single player, online or lan multiplayer, looks like all the talent from Diablo 2 left and made this game, its a lot of fun. BTW im selling my copy of this game for 30 bucks on ebay if anyone wants it, I'm done with diablo 3, HUGE DISAPOINTMENT!!! Worst Diablo yet
1.0	"Remember the hype that was building around Haze (PS3 game) that was said to be a 'Halo killer'? Well this game was nothing but hype surrounded by it's 256-online play (which is only available in ONE game mode: Domination). MAG is just another HAZE...graphics are poor, gameplay is unoriginal, content is very limited.

Don't waste your time with this game folks. Not even worth renting... Joke of a game...nothing tactical, or fun about it -- Don't buy, Don't rent!"
1.0	"I played this game over a friends house and I was very impressed.

However I will NOT support rent game policy (aka limited activations).

I never liked that policy for operating systems either. I can't tell you the amount of times I had to call and beg microsoft to let me reactivate my xp.

My situation:
I love to customize my PC, so I often update (change) memory, video cards, sound cards, etc. If you change your hardware around enough the software believes it is a system change and counts it as a re-activation.

I also love editing on my computer which takes up a lot of space. Which means sometimes I have to uninstall games or other programs and do space management. It doesn't mean I want to delete the game completely as I keep the save and profile files. It just means I may only keep 3 or 4 games on my PC and uninstall/reinstall as I see fit.

If I pay 30-60 dollars for a game I should pay for a unlimited licence to play that game.

If I wanted to pay a charge for a finite licence I would go to an arcade. FORCED HOME ARCADES CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT HAPPEN! Do not support this action! God I want to buy this game."
1.0	"I have the requirements to run this program.

The software crashes my system. I had about 20-30 minutes of play time before it crashed my system.  I followed the technical support directions of uninstalling and reinstalling and the software still crashes the system. I've ran the diagnostic testing and my system checks out fine.  After discovering this issue, I did a search on the internet to (hopefully) find a solution and instead, I found many, many, many people with the same issue I have.

My recommendation is to NOT BUY this software! Don't Buy It!  Buyers Beware!"

1.0	"PC Version is beyond awful compared and an even worse port from the consoles. Thats all you need to know. This review is 4 years late because 4 years went by after CoD4 came out, and how many of those games were good for the PC after CoD4? 1... World at War, why? Because the PC version actually had browsers and mods, to start with!

The only decent thing saving this game is the campaign. You will be able to complete the MW storyline.
A very bad thing to know is that the maps of the multiplayer itself. Even the DLC are awful.

The worst thing is no support for PC, no support for hackers, etc. Half of your games you are playing against a hacker, half of your games you have to deal with the bad peer to peer pressure. A big letdown was the servers. We have servers in MW3 PC, but they are unranked, so no one plays them. At first MW3 was a bit moddable. But now, after a few patches since then. Nothing changes, no color pallet, nothing.

Do not get this game, that is all. PC Version is beyond awful compared and an even worse port from the consoles"
1.0	"Very good grip. I have sweaty hands when I play unfortunately and these have stopped the sweating right away. Installation is easy and the grip works very well.

EDIT: So I tried to take these off because they started peeling on the bottom so I figured maybe I was wrong about the grips. TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE IDEA. THE GRIPS RUINED MY CONTROLLER. The adhesive that squidgrips uses STICKS. IT DOES NOT COME OFF. My controller was sticky everywhere and I had to throw away a WHOLE controller because of this BS NOT WORTH IT WHEN YOU TRY AND TAKE OFF THE GRIPS."
1.0	This charger looked cute -- when it worked. The second day I owned it, the lights stopped working unless I finagled the connection. Which means the charger wasn't charging. And of course jiggling the port where the USB cable connects to it to get it to function would break this cheaply made product in less than a week. Terrible. Don't waste your money on this one.
1.0	I guess Capcom must of started to see the success of steam early access titles and decided to take that model. The game barley has any modes at launch other than a lame story mode, survival, and online. Don't plan on getting too far as the servers crash half the time kicking you out of single player modes. Oh, and if it kicks you out you lose all progress and rewards. Thanks! I just wasted 40 minutes on hard survival mode to get no fighter points or ranking up! Great idea! The content road map is pretty sparse. The online lobbies crashed my game when trying to join a lobby. Why would they even bother releasing a game in this state? It's the first early release console game!
1.0	"I bought Empire Total War from SEGA and for over two months I have not been able to use it because of the fact that it has to be activated by an online organization called Steam.  Most of you are probably familiar with Steam.  You can only activate the game you bought through Steam.  But what if Steam is not working as it should?

That is what my situation is now.  Steam will not accept my activation login and password due to system error.  There is no phone number to call in order to fix this.  The only ting that you can do is contact them by e-mail and it takes them about a week for them to get back to you.  In my situation they have sent me responses telling me that the problem is fixed when it really isn't.  So I e-mail them back and I wait another week to get the same result. Don't buy this game!"
1.0	"The first Tomb Raider was what got me interested in the Playstation console.  Over the years they've gotten progressively better.  Then there was a long lapse between the 4th installment and now.  What in the world happened!??!

This title is utterly useless.  The controls are terrible.  The camera angle is annoying and the levels are very uninspiring.  Then you have this interaction with other humans that is just useless.  You choose certain sentences and that is supposed to alter the game somewhat.  All it does is use up precious game space on the disc.  Utterly useless!!!

The music, is beautiful.  But these games are known for their music.  The graphics are nice, when you can see them.  The game is way too dark.  I know it supposed to be dark as you are in a tomb, or cavern, but it doesn't have to be that dark to where you can't see certain objects or other nuances.

I also judge a game on how I can just sit and play without reading. In this instance, I had to consult the manual because the controls weren't intuitive.  Like the auto-aim and manual aim.  Some of the ""bosses"" were so lame.  At first you think it's going to be a challenge.  But, you try and try and try, and you can't beat it.  Then you do the unthinkable.  You consult the web for a walkthrough and when you read it, it's like, ""How dumb is that!!"".  After performing the moves to kill the creature, it was really quick and not very satisifying.

They include this lame ""Making of"" which is supposed to be insight on how the game was designed and what it took.  All it did was waste space on the DVD.  Who cares how you made the game.  It didn't give any special insight into the way it was created because the game itself is terrible!!

Overall this game left a very bad taste in my mouth.  One that I hope will not resurface in the next installment.

My recommendation is to skip this one.  If I could give it less than one star I would, but Amazon doesn't have that option. Extremely Disappointing!"

Everyone is right, you want a caution you will have to drive backwards. Was hoping the last patch would fix things but, OH NO, it's even worse now. When online racing you get spun out. you have literally like 2 seconds to straighten your car out or you get kicked from the race. What!. I'm trading this game in. I am so upset. I have had this game for several months and I just can't play it. I keep trying but still haven't even made it through half a season yet. This reminds me of a line from a movie ""Sphere"". Why's this book only half a book? - Only it's more like why's this game only half a game?. Why was it released unfinished? I blame both parties, the DEVS (Eutechnyx) and the Publisher (Activision).

Don't count on the promotiomal In-game items.
1.0	after midway went out of business the producer of tna impact video game started this game in 2011 unlike tna this game is polish and have a large amount of move sets but everything else looks the same as tna like short entrances lack of parts in create a wrestler mode not many match types and only 4 arenas again very limited just like tna impact game also its hard to do finishers and characters look like action figures smh thq's clone of midway's tna impact game

The finishers looked good but hell you need to do 100 on an opponent just to get a 3 count how realistic is that, thats maddening.  The AI is total garbage and stupid, you do 50 finishers on an opponent and all he needs to do is punch you, knock you down and your done, that's midway terrible.  The entrances are about 2 seconds long, the hardcore aspect of the game is not there, the gameplay is horrible, countering system sucks (bubba ray cannot reverse backflip into a super neck breaker i'm sorry).  You can just see playing this game (or trying too) that Midway hyped up yet another un-finished, pathetic, half a$$ed failure.  Bye Midway, thanks for Mortal Kombat 1,2,Trilogy and Armageddon other then that FU.  Can't wait for a better company to buy MK and TNA gaming licences. Hell they can't do any worse than the insults Midway has done to MK and TNA with such bad, horrid games.  Everyone should have seen this comming when as another reviewer already pointed out the interview on this game was done with Midway.  Every question about content and features, match types etc. was the same stupid, lame response ""Myabe in the next game"", ""That's a good idea"", ""If we have time"".....they knew they had a real turd on their hands and when they released this and so did fans.  It's half finished turds like this is why Midway failed. Complete jolk, easily the worst wrestling game ever made."

1.0	"I only played this game for five minutes, but I agree with the other low raters:  Batman takes up half the screen (the left half, for some reason,) the combat is just mashing buttons and too easy (the first bad guys you can come up and rub noses with them and they don't attack you until several seconds later,) and the bad guys are not evil enough.  Not mentioned is how slow your character is.  Unless you're running, Batman strolls and turns very slowly wherever he goes.  But here is the thing I object to the most.  At the beginning of the game, your character decides to follow the guards who are slowly, incrementally escorting the Joker inside the asylum.  This routine goes through several doors and hallways.  But this 10 minute long annoyance is just to get you to read the developer credits, which slowly fade in and out in the upper right side of the screen (maybe that's why you're on the left.)  It doesn't just force you to endure the credits; you have to participate by holding the joystick forward and following the guards, because they stop and wait for you, and the credits stop rolling, if you say ""fook this"" and throw the controller.  So for the first ten minutes of the game you are supposed to immerse yourself in the self aggrandizement of the game's developers.  Stupid, boring, and presumptuous.  And since the whole game sucks too, why am I interested in who made it?  To me the credits are akin to a hall of shame.  For some fast action where your character is actually in danger play Crysis 2 instead. Can you say slow?"
1.0	"There are just so many things wrong with this game, I can't believe I wasted $60 on it. Few things on my mind that I'd like to point out.

PvP - Blizzard decided to release the game, then patch in PvP months later. There is still no PvP option, and so many people have stopped playing the game, there will be almost no one left to play the PvP. This is one of the big problems. TO be honest though, even PvP would not have kept me playing.

Auction House - I'd like to be able to be excited when I find good equipment to use in the game, but now even equipment is just a grind. You just buy something from the auction house every few levels, and never ever use the things you find. Now, it's not just the killing/leveling that is a grind, but gearing is too.

Max Level - They expect you to play the same game 4 times to reach max level, which I just find kind of silly.

This game just seriously sucked, don't make the mistake of buying it. I'm sure Torchlight 2 will be almost as good, and it's only 1/3 the price, so. Blizzard let me down..."

The story is well done and even though the campaign is short, the multiplayer component is so much fun that it makes up for that. Great game. REALLY!

The problem with ""Homefront"" is that it freezes A LOT! This is an inexcusable problem where consoles are concerned. They knew what the hardware would be. I'm literally insulted by the freezes.

I'm giving this game Five Stars for fun but the freeze problem makes this a ""One Star"" game. The developer is out of business for good reason. This is a defective product plain and simple. Really awesome experience if it doesn't freeze."

Update: The Sega forums suggest some solutions to the glitchy scenarios which you might want to try. The following is a list of keyboard controls which is different from (and more complete) than the game manual. HTH:

Iron Man Keyboard controls

W Move Forward
A Move Backward
S Move Left
D Move Right
Mouse Move Camera / Target Enemy
Left Mouse Button Fire Weapon
Middle Mouse Wheel Next Weapon
Right Mouse Button Afterburner
Space Bar Hover Up
X Freefall (when hovering)
F Punch / Contextual Action
Shift Dash
1 Propulsion Energy
2 Armor Energy
3 Weapon Energy
4 Even Energy
Escape Pause Menu

Left Alt: Afterburner flight

The game starts off nicely enough with a ""bash through the tunnels and kill the bad guys"" scenario. Simplistic controls, dated graphics but not bad either. Second scenario is flight and weapons testing, an overly long tutorial as you learn the basics of flight and weapons with the suit. Not bad either but then the scenario doesn't end, you can't get out of the warehouse/target range to move on to the next scenario. The walkthrough that's posted online is for the console version, NOT the PC version (appears to be major differences) and there are no patches posted, I'm writing this on May 24, 2008 and hoping that they'll fix the problem and post a patch for it. So far I'm very disappointed, I have to agree with the poster who said this looks like a ""rush job"" rather than a finished product. I haven't returned it because I'm hoping that they can fix the problem with a patch, I've been an Iron Man fan for many years and am still looking forward to playing this game.

I have installed the latest and correct drivers and software on two machines (both Win7 64-bit), and I am unable to get the programmable buttons to work at all. The left/right mouse buttons work, as well as the DPI switch, but the programmable buttons do not. I have previously owned the RAT 7, so I do know how to install and set up the mouse. I will be returning this product if I am still unable to get it to work by Monday Programming buttons doesn't work
1.0	"This was one of the best Non-PC racing simulations ever made, however in an attempt to force gamers to move to the hugely inferior, bug ridden and micro-transaction bloated GT6, Sony has discontinued the online servers for GT5.  As this game is only around 3 years old and reportably still had around 100k users gaming daily on it at the time the servers were shut down, this was a very underhanded move on Sony's part.

After being worked over by Sony in this way, I felt obligated to warn prospected buyers of this.  While there is still a great single player experience to be had, most serious race simmers do enjoy online racing from time to time (or the other online features) If all you want is the single player experience, then go ahead and grab it, you can't do much better where single player racing is concerned.  From graphics,to sound to control, this is probably still the best there is on a console.  However, you may wish to grab a cheap used copy since with no online services, there's really no reason to get this new. No longer supports online"
1.0	I made a mistake on buying Infinite Warfare with remastered Modern Warfare. Graphics on Modern Warfare are terrible and not worth the extra money. Terrible is not what I really wanted to say, but I am not allowed to say that here. I have played remastered games before and they were ten times better then Modern Warfare remastered. The worst part is, I didn't get it until the end of the day of release date. Should have been able to receive it the day before the game actually starts. You can't play anyway until then. One more thing, never received beta codes. This is  why I only gave it one stars. Modern Warfare remastered not worth the extra money!
1.0	This the worst racing game ever.  I would never recommend this game to anyone to purchase or to rent anytime. F1
1.0	grandson loves One Star
1.0	I really enjoyed all the other GTA games and high hopes for this one. I didn't want to believe all the bad press, but it's true. After an arduous hour or so of loading up the game and non-essential software, I eagerly double-clicked the game icon only to have the game crash each time with a fatal error. I didn't even get as far as the bad graphics...alas. Those will be the last dollars I ever spend on a Rockstar product and thus I'm REALLY glad I waited until Amazon dropped the price before purchasing. Very disappointing. I didn't want to believe
1.0	It so bad I tried to play it but got no fun out of it do not buy. Vary bad
1.0	I don't know what all you other people played, because this game is boring! I wouldn't recommend it for any gamer. Avoid this at all costs! Very boring
1.0	"This is a Steam game, and I never could get it to work? I still don't know
why.  I play all kinds of other games at Steam etc, but try as I may and asking
for Steam's help etc nothing gets it working for me???  And Steam doesn't
really ""care"" if you can't.  I asked for tech help at Steam and got suggestions--which i followed--from
Steam but nothing worked and basically they said--""too bad for you"". And that
was it. They don't promise that the game will work. So its on me i guess. Never got it working??"
1.0	"Now, this game seems promising, and that's because it is!  It's promising... but that's all.  I should've seen that EA was behind this and given up hope, but alas... I spent the money.

This game offers no solid tutorial.  It has a tutorial, but damned if I can figure it out.

After toying around with the games limited usage, I realized that this is worthless, even in the sandbox genre.  It's limited, boring, and useless.  I'm just too lazy to write a good review on WHY it's bad.  I don't feel that this is worth my time in explaining. They Created ""Something""..."
1.0	"I was really desprite to get this game because I wanted ahelicopter Gunship game.  I had Commanche Gold but that was good for beginers. I wanted something more advanced.  I bought this.
Here is my two cents.  This game was terrible. DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE SAYING IT IS GOOD.  If you really want a good Attack helicopter game get ""Eenemy Engaged: RAH-66 Commanche vs. Ka-52 Hokum B: Aligator"" Long name but good game.  Now back to Gunship.  As everyone said the waypoont system just plain doesn't work, you have to go through a whole menu system and it only worked for me during the demo.  The CP/G is a usless jerk who never does anything you say.  And if you play as the CP/G the pilot always gets you killed.  Firing a missile at the target YOU want is nearly impossible and for [the price] this is just a real rip off.
So in a summary all I can say is don't buy this buy somethiung else... A terrible way for Microprose to end its simulation line."
1.0	The s-video connector is faulty. It only works as a composite cable. I wish I had tried it sooner as I would have returned it. Defective!
1.0	I very infrequently am passionate about a video game to the point of actually writing a review.  I let my pre-order stay, even with all the bad press, because very often I am able to look beyond surface flaws and enjoy games which critical response is average.  This game is terrible.  Not fun.  Avoid at all costs. Please avoid.
1.0	"It has never worked and I can""t get the company to help me fix the problem One Star"
1.0	The poor man's Ninja Gaiden.  Just terrible in every way. I fell for it because of the MGS lineage, but don't make the same mistake I did.  Avoid like the plague.  Konami is the new Sega. Shameless prostitution of the MGS game series.
1.0	We have the same unit for the Xbox 1. It is fantastic, that's why I ordered this. Well this one is terrible. You have to fight to connect the controller to the charging stand! That's Insaine! Then you have to fight to remove it. This unit is garbage. Your better off getting recharable batteries and charging them seperate. This is a true headache and a waste of money. It's going back! not worth the money
1.0	This game was and is so hyped I thought it would blow its competitor at its release Devil May Cry 3 out of the water. It had decent action but no where nere the fun or variety of DMC 3 with annoying button combos to pull of finishing moves, this worked in RE4 when it was used sparsley and to make you watch cut scenes but is over used here.  Had it not been so hyped I would have given it 3 stars as a rental, but it is worthy of 2. Way too overated
1.0	2 of them broke, only worked for 3 months. One Star
1.0	"Seriously, it's one of the worst games ever! Terrible graphics, especially compared to the PS Triple's, no voice acting, boring puzzles, and above all, it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game. Plus why is the main villian black? That's racist!

For a good Zelda game, I recommend Link: The Faces of Evil, The Wand of Gamelon, or Zelda's Adventure. Why does everyone like this?"
1.0	Includes two minor items, no new group interactions and hair and clothing far inferior to custom content you can download free at dozens of sites.  This would have been the perfect pack to re-introduce the hot tub, video gaming console or even the sprinkler all from TS3 but no.  Instead we get items that basically make this an upgrade to cooking skill.  Another big let down from EA. Disappointment
1.0	Free time installation has been known to require a anti piracy download known as securom which fries cd burners slows your pc and has been even known to disable your pc. Purchase at your own risk. Warning securom malware
1.0	Games crashes after about 20 minutes of game play. Has crashed at same spot three consecutive times and it's frustrating as heck. These game developers need to finish their games off and work out bugs before they ship them out. Great start but game breaking bug...
1.0	[....]Any team can become the champs of all the teams. You can be the darn expos and be about 100 games above 500. The sliders break too much and the curveballs are just between a change up and a fastball. the first one you throw is always awesome. Acclaim needs to make the game a little harder. The batting stances are outta wack. The brewers my favorite team is underrated(of course). With good players you hit 500 homeruns a year. on the back of the box they say franchise debut but there is no franchise [....] stupidest game of all
1.0	"One of the major reason why previous Far Cry games were fun was that they were  SHOOTING GAMES with all different gun and rifles.  This game is misleading and should not have the title of ""Far Cry"" since it is radically different from previous Far Cry games. There is no fun in playing when you have very limited options of weapons with no joy in killing by shooting anything since bow is so weak and does not kill anything.
Also the dialogue is all gibberish with subtitle in English. But player speak the same langue and understands the gibberish so shouldn't they just speak in English ?? I will be looking forward to playing real Far Cry 6. ... the major reason why previous Far Cry games were fun was that they were SHOOTING GAMES with all different ..."
1.0	Did not work had to return One Star
1.0	This Game absolutly sucks to the max the movie sucks how can the game posibly be any better sure the graphics are good but it sucks just as Aqua-man and super man geez katamari damacy is better than that if you want an good game get Halo 2 , Doom 3 or splinter cell chaos theory or at least get spiderman 2 the best marvel game out there you can explore new york and the fighting and controls are good. since the scale doesnt have a zero give this game a 1 out of 5 OH MY GOSH
1.0	I hate DRM.  2 activation limit? Give me a break.  I hate that the industry limits me like this. If I spend good money on a game or CD, I expect to be able to install and play it as much as I want where ever I want. Especially if I pay full price.  I won't buy a CD or game with this feature, and everyone else I know won't either.  I always buy my CDs, games and DVDs. I want the quality, reliability and accessibility of owning my own original copies, and yet I'm punished for that honesty.  Its not appropriate and I won't support it with my money. 2 installs?
1.0	I installed this on my xbox one s, played it once for an hour, went to play it again and now it tells me that it won't play on an xbox one only on 360, WTH!? Really bummed, what a waste of money. I got jipped!
1.0	"I bought this system in November 2011.  It is now July 2013, and I got the solid red ring of death!  Do you believe this???

Well, I do.  Microsoft's Xbox is NOTORIOUS for having hardware failures and other problems, and this time, I fell victim to it all.  I don't abuse my system at all (never dropped the controller, banged the system, or played for extremely long hours).  As I was playing Bioshock Infinite, I noticed that my system was making these weird clicking noises with subtle long, intermittent beeping occurring.  Then I couldn't autosave anything during the game. I managed to finish the game while the clicks and beeps were going on, but after I shut the system off and restarted, RED RING!  This system should NOT have failed in less than 2 years of owning it!  I've had my PS3 since February 2010, and that system has not failed me whatsoever.

I will NEVER, EVER buy anything XBox-related ever again.  It's Sony all the way, and I strongly suggest that nobody purchases the Xbox One.  With all the outlandish policies Microsoft has regarding that system, as well as the apologies Microsoft has given about them, that's reason enough to boycott the Xbox gaming line.

Happy 4th of July, Microsoft!  In the dumpster you go! WORST SYSTEM EVER....Red-Ringed!"
1.0	"Being a Blade movie fan and a PS2 geek, I was excited about purchasing this game. Unfortunatley, it fell beneath my gaming expectations. The graphics are ""cartoon"" like, the 360 degree movements start to get annoying if not dizzy, and the lack of a map will leave you directionless although their are ""glyphs"" that help occasionally to steer you in the right path but not enough of them. Those three thing that I pointed out was enough for me to wish that I had rented it before I purchased it. FAIR WARNING: rent it before you buy it!!!"
1.0	I thought this was gonna be good One Star
1.0	The graphics are great and the tanks look good. But the games engine to determine the battle teams is flawed beyond anything imaginable. The match making design continues to allow most matches to end in complete routes with literally zero chance for one team to win or even come close to winning. You will hear from the developers that this is by design, to try and simulate war time confrontations. But soon after you have 20 battles in a row (in a game that is supposed to be fun) that end with your team losing by 12 tanks for more, you will understand. Don't waste your time and more importantly money on this inadequate game. Good game, Matches are rigged due to flawed match making design
1.0	First of all the graphics are horrible. The handling and physics are just unbelievably stupid. I would highly recommend this game as a coaster for your coffee. Bogus Game
1.0	"I thought I was purchasing a new controller as that is what I selected.  However, I was still sent a refurbished one anyways.  I hope I did not pay for a new controller and got a refurbished one (I cannot find ""refurbished"" in any of the product descriptions).

The controller itself does not work with every game, and with the ones I have tested out, there appears to be a significant latency issue.  The controller does not like to stay paired when not in use and needs to be repaired every time.  The controller feels absolutely durable, but that is about the only nice thing I can think of right now.

EDIT: after a while with the controller, but low usage, it connects to phone but does not work with any game anymore.  New batteries, new phone, complete reset of pairing and phone still it does not work. The controller does not like to stay paired when not in use and needs ..."
1.0	This release was completely underwhelming.  The kids played with it a couple of times then ignored it as it really didn't present anything new for them.  It went over slightly less enthusiastically than the Guitar Hero Aerosmith release. Big MEH!
1.0	It was just the regular game with a redeemed PSN code.  There is an option to get the DLC on a separate disc get that if it is used.  The regular game is a lot cheaper. Make Sure to Get the Two Disc
1.0	Still trying to get it downloaded so can use in game play questionable
1.0	Horrible graphics, the playing still is wicked lame, do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this game and tell everyone of your gaming buddies to NEVER buy it either! Worst Game EVER Made
1.0	now i had this game with the ps4..and it lagged..a little but i still found it decent..probably the best thing you can get this game on. but its still a poorly optimized game, especially for pc. the graphics on pc were a lil better than ps4 only because of better shadows. this game is very unplayable...on black ops 2 my rig can handle it past the max which is 200fps...this game its at 90fps..but it was very choppy,, it felt more like 20fps, no bulls***..time to render each frame was slow but it was the game itself. its hard to enjoy this game at all. if you actually want to buy this game then stick to ps4 or xbox one if ya got one or else don't buy this at all. probably the best thing you can get this game on
1.0	fell apart after 4 months.plastic cracked on headset part, not ear peices. Never again. fell apart after 4 months. plastic cracked on headset ...
1.0	"Death to Spies is easily the most frustrating PC game I have ever played. I can understand making a game challenging but this game far surpasses challenging and moves into ridiculous. Here you are a USSR counterintelligence officer who is trying to infiltrate the Nazi party.  The game does have great graphics, gameplay and is extremely faithful to historical settings. But overall, this one is just too time consuming, difficult and annoying for me to deal with.

Not Recommended Frustrating and Annoying..."
1.0	"I can't believe people are rating this a 5. I've played Hearts of Iron I & II from Paradox and those were good fun. This however has little real game play interaction, combat is boring and never seems to end. There is no process for how combat is resolved. One navel battle took 3 weeks and this game is supposed to be historically accurate, where fantasyland? And of course there's the computer player which makes up it's own rules as it goes. If you're looking for something decent try one of the ""Total War"" games as they are probably the best. If you feel like wasting your money go buy grass seed, you'll enjoy yourself more watching the grass grow. Too Bad I couldn't give it a zero"
1.0	I don't own it anymore, Amazon as usual help solve the problem of the game not working and canceled it, as well as giving me a refund.  This is for Amazon: Thank you for everything you do for me. Karen I don't own it anymore, Amazon as usual help ...
1.0	"Oh boy oh boy I tried playing this game but just couldn't have fun wiht it.

the combat is aweful and repetitive.
levels are dull narrow and boring.
the game was just way too repetitive for me to enjoy. Batman rise of repetiveness"

1.0	this game is so bad they need to keep to the original story when thy changed the graphics and the controls I lost intrest please make another game and don't get lazy with making it g I love ace combat 1through 6 why did thy do this to a perfect game needs improvment
1.0	Again...another $60 map pack.  Not that I like hiding...but when every map is set up like a laser tag course, 8 entrances per room...it gets a bit ridiculous. Great seller.
1.0	Same game as standard eddition, not worth the extra money when only bonus item is a statue. :( not worth it.
1.0	Disappointed. One Star
1.0	"I've been a fan of the Sims since the beginning.  I was really excited about the Sims 4.  It looked great in the previews with the different ""tweaking"" that could be done to the Sims body parts.  I got it and it's just been disappointing.  It's not fun, at all.  It's not worth the price.  There's no real content to justify the price.  And the customization is so lacking in so many ways.  I don't like it.  I'll just stick with my older Sims games, they're more fun. Not worth the money."
1.0	Literally the worst screen protector I have ever used on any portable gaming system since I started using them for every system back when the Game Boy Advance came out. I blindly bought this due to the fact that it has good ratings, no idea how it got them, literally every screen protector made by every legitimate and bogus company has worked better than this, guaranteed no bubbles? Can I get my money back? Because there are 30-40 tiny bubbles (impossible to avoid due to how the directions themselves -seem- to attempt to direct you to put the protector on) all over the protectors. Very disappointed at the high cost of this protector and the very low quality of the product. If they charged 2$ for this it would be too much. DO NOT BUY!!! Worst screen protector I have EVER used.
1.0	I really regreted, I do not recommend at all. I do not recommend at all

SPECIAL REQUEST:  I hope you'll have one that does not need XBOX Gold to play it. Excellent customer servicing as usual"
1.0	"I am a  Huge Total War fan. Bought all the Creative Ensemble Total War games, the expansion packs, the special editions , the soundtracks, the lot. I have reserved the Special Forces edition for in-store pickup at a major North American electronics retail chain . I had it in my hand, read the requirements on the back, and returned it to the amazed salesperson.
  I feel like weeping, I wanted this games so much; but I would not compromise on my principles. Death to DRM, shame on you Sega for inflicting this upon your most loyal customers. Returned due to Steam"
1.0	Unplayably bad. What a disappointment. Somehow Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, which came out like 7-8 years ago, is better in every single way. Even graphics. And less bugs. This game was such a letdown! Unplayably bad.
1.0	"This is the worst game system out to date you must beware. There is a 33% fail rate ""but i feel its allot more then that because i had to send mine back 8 times because it just died on me"" and if u want games with good graphics then yea this system is good but still not the best ""PS3 has the best"" and if you want to watch an HD movie you can do BUT you would have to spend an extra 200 bucks for the HD-DVD drive to watch em. Wanna have wireless internet? SURE you can....time to spend 120 bucks for it because its not built in....

Wanna play TRUE HD gaming and play on 1080p.....guess what you cant even though they do have a HDMI port in the system its only ver 1.2 you need 1.3 to get TRUE 1080p.....yea i know microsoft lied to you and i did like the system at first when i got mine but after i did some research i learned that its not good at all and sending my system back 8 times was starting to get very very old

so do yourself a favor and do not buy this system and if you do buy it you will see what i mean when your systems dies and you have to send it in 6-100 times

i would tell you to get a ps3 for a less then .2% fail rate, best graphics, free online, HD movies ""blu-ray"", built in wireless internet, and really really good games

so think about it and before you buy this worthless system read before you buy TRUST me"
1.0	"Plugged in the charger to my laptop's USB port, then into my original 3DS (not ""New"" or XL). Charge light was steady for a couple seconds, then began to blink in bursts of three, as if it were warning me of a bad charge. When I touched the 3DS plug to check its connection, it was very lose in the socket and each touch made the charge light flicker. I immediately unplugged it and initiated a return.

(With deference to Amazon's customer service, they gave me a full refund, so I have no complaints there. However, they did tell me not to even bother returning it and to throw it out, which may indicate Amazon's own lack of faith in this product.) Doesn't work."
1.0	Won't run on windows 10 One Star
1.0	This game is multiplayer only (you can only play with bots by yourself) and it is OBVIOUS they cut out a lot of content to sell to you as DLC. There are monsters that cost $15 ON TOP of the $60 asking price for the game. As for the game itself, it gets boring after about 20 minutes. Repetitive in nature and you will feel like you just played the fight you are on. Boring and not worth your money. Not worth your money at all
1.0	As MANY others have stated, these headsets are good, except that they DONT LAST! I went through 3 pair and they literally all died in under 2 or 3 months. Either one side of the headset stops working, or the mic stops working, or the volume stops working. Im the kind of person that takes extra good care of my items. Even with such an obsessive trait as mine to keep things in mint condition, it wasn't enough for this cheap headset. $40 is robbery. They should be $10 CHEAP. WONT LAST. SOUND GOOD and would be great if they didn't die in 2 months!
1.0	Full disclosure; I did not buy this game from Amazon. Not that it matters. It would still be terrible, no matter where I bought it. Where to start? (Spoilers ahead, kinda) There's so much about this game that disappoints. The graphics are great. There's that. The game IS playable. Everything works. My problems with this game started from the start. I'll put it simple. There is NO logic in this game. Not in the gameplay, or the story. Let me tell you, that really hurts the story. A story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. This game's story has a middle. I did not care at all about the story or characters in the slightest. Nothing is explained, and what little explanation there is makes no sense whatsoever. The character's motives are paper thin; if they even have any established, that is. But the gameplay is what kills it. In the beginning, Lara loses her stuff. Which is fine. But I expected her to loot the first fully equipped enemy she killed. She did not. She's freezing in the wilderness, and has no supplies. She kills a guy who's got everything she needs; and she takes next to nothing off him. He's got a gun. Ammo. A knife. Grenades. Grappling hook with rope. A radio, with an open line to all enemy chatter. Warm clothes. A backpack with presumably even more goodies. But Lara doesn't want that stuff. She makes an impossibly durable bow, without having supplies to do so. She has the climbing axes. Which could be converted into a grappling hook, were a rope attached. But tying a rope to a climbing axe is too advanced for a woman who could fashion an unbreakable bow without the equipment to do so. She could've used one of the dead enemy's combat knives, but no. So be ready to take the hard road everywhere you go. Thankfully, Lara's climbing axes are capable of penetrating solid rock. Tedious? Yes! Please make me take the most circuitous route possible! Yay! I love wasting my time! Hand to hand combat is a complete joke. Don't believe me? Attack the flamethrower boss guy with the climbing axes, early on, in the game. You'll see. Lara's close quarters combat skills are equal to that of a blind, drunk, 4 year old swinging away. Another joke, is the enemy AI. They share a hive-mind, which means if one enemy spots you, they all instantly know your exact location, and start shooting at you with auto lock on, and infinite ammo. If you kill an enemy from the bushes, and the other enemies are alerted, without ever having seen Lara, they will always work their way over to her exact hiding spot. The gun battles are miserably bad. Enemies float grenades right to your cover spot so flawlessly, they could win all the dart tournaments ever held. A bullseye every time. It might the cheapest AI I've encountered in my life. So many areas are only accessed with new and pointless upgrades. Meaning, a lot of pointless backtracking. Speaking of pointless things, brings me to the actual tombs she raids. Utter waste, should cover the necessity for them. She gets general knowledge that qualify as common sense, by raiding said tombs. Which brings me to the upgrading system. Yet another waste of time and space. The upgrades are things that Lara should be doing anyway. The irrational upgrade system serves to justify the seemingly endless collection of junk. I had to do a mission for a guy, to get a lock pick. Later, Lara is locked in a jail. She pulls a pin out of her hair, and uses it to pick a lock! Thanks for wasting my time, making me do something completely unnecessary. The design of this game seems to be centered on pointlessness, tedium, and repetition. All side missions are a total waste. All dialogue is just filler. And boy, do I mean that. This game wins the award for most filler material I've ever encountered in my gamer life! I also love finding gun parts in chests, in order to put guns together. Especially when I could just take them off of enemies I've killed. But why just take a gun off an enemy, when you can assemble them instead? Honest to God; I killed an enemy from the bushes, and the enemy's rifle disappeared in midair, while the guy was falling. No wonder I can't take their weapon when they die; it disappears from existence! It was also a pleasure to not be in control of Lara when she goes in and out of stealth. Isn't it wonderful to be holding a controller, but not be in control of what's happening? They really should've found some other way to get Lara around watery areas. Because she was more likely to die of hypothermia, than enemy fire, or falling to her death in this game. I could go on and on here. But the point is; this game is worthless. It is so formulaic, and predictable, it doesn't need to even exist. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics were probably more capable of making a better game than this. But for whatever reason, they didn't. I played the Tomb Raider they made before this one; and it was pretty much the same deal. So they just repackaged the same game, with the same problems, and derivative characters and story. They did this for the fan boys, and no one else. So fan boys go,YAY!! Thanks to you, no progress is made in games. Games can't innovate, cause you'll feel betrayed, and urinate rivers of nerd-rage. Fan boys will be the death of game evolution. Just give them the same thing over and over and over and over; and they'll be happy. Just them, though. I didn't wait a year, and spend full price for this game, just to be let down like this. I went in full of hope; and left with utter disgust. Playing a bad game, is like buying a bad meal, that you can't return for a refund. You have two choices. Eat it, one miserable bite at a time. Or walk out, and throw your money away. If you loved the Uncharted quadrilogy, and want to play something that is worse in every possible way; this is the game for you. Just an honest review.
1.0	No bueno help. SAve Ne Jesus
1.0	Cheap One Star
1.0	Had high hopes for this game since i loved the first black ops. This game does not even touch the original in multi-player. There is no skill required to play ,no strategy other than camp and shoot people as they pass. All the maps are small so its basically kill and be killed. How anyone can even get at least 10 kills in a row is beyond me unless you are a great camper! and there are plenty of places to hide even on the small maps! I hate to be so negative but after about 5 hours of play i will be putting this garbage on craigslist. Shame on these guys for even comparing this to the original. If you liked modern warfare 2 and 3 and like the cartoon action this is the game for you but we will be back on the original starting tommorrow!! Black Ops  2 = Garbage!!!
1.0	"Here we have an evil, mindless, blonde caucasian American and her attempt to ruin a Japanese guy's marriage with his Japanese girlfriend. Blatant, obvious insult to our boys.

You have to question how this filth even got published.

Now let's ignore the gameplay that makes Mario Party look innovative and get to the point of this review : Then there's the message of polyamory -- a bad message to send to any and every one. I myself, as a married Christian gamer who plays Call of Duty, I find a videogame that promotes polyamory to be offensive, and you should to. More-so than our boys.

And If you support our boys, you do not allow your children, siblings - anyone - to purchase or play (or even look at the box art of) Catherine. Despite It's M rating, Catherine falls into the same category as Alice : Madness Returns. It is not a family friendly videogame.

They're not laughing with us. Polyamorous Propaganda"
1.0	Game came scratched wouldn't play on my console. One Star
1.0	Ok let's get the facts. When diehard gamecube fans say things like the PS2 will get weaker and weaker, that's not true the PS2 keeps getting stronger because it has the greatest and most variety of games--- a known fact. another fact is that people say the the PS2's are selling so much beter than gamecube and Xbox because of DVD, isn't true.  People realize that the DVD function may not be the greatest, but they buy the PS2 for the games.  People also say that the PS2 has a weaker game play quality and graphics- take a game like Virtual fighter 4- that has a greater polygon rate. so before you buy any system look at both sides of the story!! Nintendo SUCKS!!!!
1.0	This is a wonderful game but like most good games it actually performs much better on the xbox than the ps3 so if your a fan of the series you owe it yourself to get the superior version. Great game but.....
1.0	Came cracked and non working Beware of this seller
1.0	I consider myself a fan of tactical espionage. I've played through all of the PS Metal Gears (the games I consider to be the top in the genre) several times. I enjoyed Nina Williams' character in Tekken and the idea of a female lead. Ugh, I should have just avoided it. Not only are the controls poor (everything has to do with the right analog stick) but the camera changes from you being able to control it to not depending on where you are. To run you need to hold R2 but this also switches to an over-the-head view. As you enter a different section, the camera may switch back to fixed or visa versa. How are you supposed to be able to sneak up on people if you can't even control the character well? I already want to throw it away. Horrible, horrible game. I can't believe how many people gave this 5 stars...
1.0	It broke after a few uses. D-Pad stopped working and the L1/2 and R1/2 buttons were reversed! One Star
1.0	"EA was just ranked the worst company in existence right now, and have earned this year's ""Golden Poo"" award.  Look it up online.

And they have DEFINITELY earned it.

Happy to say I will never be stupid enough to buy any of EA's products ever again.  I have watched the Battlefield series of games just continue to tank downhill release after release ever since that shrink-wrapped hack magnet known as BF2 was released. Smart enough not to buy it."
1.0	Horrible cheesy game. Looks like it should be for 3 year olds,  but is complicated that only adults can play the game. DONT BUY
1.0	I really looked forward to this game. I've never been more disappointed. There are so many bugs it ruins the games full potential. With Bioware not planning to address these issues, this game is a waste of money. The Most Bugged Game Ever
1.0	"A lot of good reviews--two perfect 5 star reviews even. Amazon.com gets to choose which reviews are ""featured"", so that's not really much of a surprise.
You should definitely read more reviews. The graphics are okay, but the design of the graphics in this game are considered to be very cartoonish by many. Bright oranges, glowing blues, and odd color assortments await you in this game. Do yourself a favor and search for the original Battlezone. That was a game I played so many years ago I can't even remember when, but I remember clearly the missions and the specific gameplay elements because it was so good. The story made more sense, the missions didn't tell you exactly what to do (you had to figure it out, which was the fun part), and the overhead map was accessible from the push of a button rather than getting out of your vehicle all of the time. To summarize what these reviews (on the first page) are all leaving out:
- You'll have to get out of your vehicle constantly. Because the drivers of other vehicles just aren't smart enough to do the job themselves. You'll also have to do this to access the tactical map, the only way of ordering units around without actually driving there (by which time the units in question will have already been destroyed, too little, too late)
- Missions aren't involving, and the story doesn't continue from the original game. In short, there's really not much of a story, as you'll find yourself doing strange things that you've been ordered to do for no apparent reason
- Interface is cluttered, buttons rearrange themselves based on the order that you built things, and it's a nightmare finding the right keys to press during the heat of battle. In many games, the only deciding factor of whether you'll win or lose is if you find the right keys fast enough Just thought I'd try and tell the truth"
1.0	Theirs nothing to do in this game , but running around finding the next strongest gun or cool clothes. Nothing to this game except a decent story. Highly recommend buy a different game. Boring...

1.0	Lasted a few weeks at best... cheap
1.0	Great game but I've spent more time watching the loading screen than anything. I bought this for playing online with friends and after spending roughly 8 hours trying to play I think I got a total of 2 hours of gameplay. I'd rather just not play this then put up with the stress and frustration of trying to play with friends only to have 10-30 minutes of loading screens. Grand Theft Loading... get used to the loading screen you will see it more than the game
1.0	This is simply far cry 4 rip off guys, don't buy. It doesn't help that the PS4 version was developed to make the Xbox One version look the same as our superior PS4 machine. This is blasphemy of the worst kind. far cry 4 rip-off with wrestling moves

1.0	"Bought a brand new package from Target on 11/28 for my 5 year old twins.  They really, really wanted this game, and SANTA got it for them.  It was their ""big"" gift, so there was no fallback for the Man in the Red Suit...

Xmas day arrives, we set it up....and the drums don't work at all.  So I got online, and found that this was not an uncommon problem.  However, had the drums actually worked, the chances were very good that one or both of the cymbals would not be registering hits correctly, or would simply stop working after a few hours.  Do a little searching on the GH drum kit, and I think you'll find that this has been a KNOWN PROBLEM since the product was first released.

Now here's the punchline: Activision has taken a hard line against actually standing behind their own product.  Many people have been turned away by Activision - told to call the company that manufactures the drums (called RedOctane).  And - are you sitting down?- RedOctane will glady replace the defective drums...but YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING the defective under-warranty product to them.

Never in my life have I heard of such nonsense.

A company worth anything would Fedex a working set to you, and have you send the defective unit back.  But let's be honet - a REAL company would have a Quality Assurance department that would catch major things like defective drum kits before they left the factory.  My opinion?  RedOctane and probably Activision knew there was a very high failure rate on these drum units, but didn't care.  The more important thing was to get them out the door in time for Christmas, customer be damned.

Nevermind the two 5-year olds who cried Christmas morning because Santa gave them a broken toy.

I am going to go back to Target tomorrow and HOPE they take this game back.  If I am told I need to return it to the manufacturer, there's gonna be heck to pay.  At this point, all I want is store credit.

$189 plus tax for a game broken right out of the box.  If this were an isolated incident, and the company stood behind it, it would be understandable.  But when they admit it's a widespread problem, but will only fix it AT MY EXPENSE, it's unforgivable.  There is one fewer Activision customer in the world.

So go ahead, roll the dice, and pray you get a working unit.  But make sure you do a little Google search regarding the defects first.

And be VERY careful if you want to order this online.  The chances of being able to return it will be slim to none. This product was rushed out the door for Xmas with massive defects"
1.0	"This game is chock full of issues. As another reviewer highlighted, the online MP is basically unplayable. To call it lag would be a massive understatement. Most of the things I have to say have been said by other reviewers. I realize the fanboys will rate this review as not helpful simply because its a poor review, but its the truth. This game is the biggest disappointment of 2011.

I am so sick and tired of buying video games that have had ZERO beta testing. I've been waiting for the release of his game since E3 2009. I even went ahead and contacted Bethesda about a year ago to see if I could get a beta key (I've done closed beta testing for other games like Medal of Honor, Killzone 3, Deadspace 2 and did Gears of War 3 beta testing prior to their current open beta.) In any case, they informed me that they have several guys inhouse who do it. #FAIL Bethesda! This game is rubbish. The movement is anything but smooth. The bullet damage is low. The multiplayer is so laggy.

Oh and for PS3 players (which I have also) there is no party system. The 360 has a party system built in which makes grouping possible, but this is a join current session only piece of rubbish. Bethesda Fail"
1.0	Bought it used for $7.99 at a local game shop. Hard to control,not very entertaining,and just kinda boring overall. It was a waste of $$ at $7.99-even used. Boring & short
1.0	No. I love niche jrpgs and I buy them all anyway, however this game is awful. It's pointlessly difficult and is not worth any amount of money even in the hopes of a sequel. Don't waste your time Don't waste your time honestly.
1.0	"What a scam. First if you want to buy this to buy something digital to avoid having to wait for shipping, don't, because there might be a 3 day wait upon adding this to being able to use it. Blizzard doesn't explain what will or will not make you have to wait and just appears to be random at this point. Next, you can't pay the difference. If you have credit here, and want to use this to buy a blizzard game and pay the difference, can't do it. You either have to have enough battle.net credit to cover the whole cost or it won't work. So if you want to buy a $50 digital game from blizzard, you have to either buy $60 worth of battle.net cards or don't bother, because amazon only sells them in $20 increments.

It should be illegal to force you to go all or nothing with gift cards. That alone makes this a terrible gift.

I'm disappointed by both amazon and blizzard with this. Terrible way to shop. Blizz has an all or nothing approach to using gift cards as a payment."
1.0	Costs too much, kinect is dead, and assassin's creed is way too buggy. I sent this back as soon as soon as I figured out the kinect wasn't supported anymore. Costs too much, kinect is dead, and assassin's ...
1.0	Don't even waste your time or money. I admit I got it gave it a try and was completely disgusted with the hype and unanswered questions before the game came out. For all you newbie players, you might like it but for a long time eashl player and vet of the game series, what a rip off. I went back to the ps3 version and that is almost a carbon copy of 14. Ea you really flubbed this one and it's going to take a lot to gain my trust back. Read the 5 and 4 star reviews, it was either grandpa and grandma Christmas gifts or 10 year olds who have bought their very first ea nhl hockey game. Or they have no clue or have played an actual game of Hockey, go to bed! DROPPED THE PUCK ON THIS ONE
1.0	Sound is ok for price. Xbox360 adapter does not work. Had to spend more money to buy adapters that do. Not the most comfortable and mic bairly works. Do not buy for use with 360. Not the most comfortable and mic bairly works
1.0	"Pulled it out of the box and watched the casing of the Kinect come apart, the bottom side was covered in what was probably double sided tape that stuck to my hands. Plugged it in, xbox would not register this device. Ran down all the ""trouble shooting"" steps, still did not work. The only Trouble was that I was sent a defective product and they attempted to pass it off as ""certified refurbished."" Pulled it out of the box and watched the casing ..."
1.0	Just a heads-up to anyone considering purchasing this game: Not only does this game include the virus that is SecuROM, but it also includes a trojan called Games for Windows Live which will phone home to activation servers, without asking for permission or even notifying you that activation is taking place. Virus and trojan included at no additional cost
1.0	Garbage, the L buttons really ruin it - it would otherwise be usable but the play on the L buttons is just bad. Too much play on the L buttons, no pressure sensitivity - junk
1.0	This is just not the game for me.  I have played many stealth based games, and there are those that have done it much better.  This just did not appeal to me.  I did not play past the first couple of missions.  This, of course, doesn't mean that someone else won't like it.  I just found it boring and tedious and the first mission should engross you and encourage you to play on, this just didn't do that.  Graphics are nice and crisp, game play falls flat.  For the casual player this game would prove difficult and frustrating, to a more seasoned player there is challenge to be had, but its still frustrating.  Camera is wonky, sneaking seems to work on occasion, more often than not you will find yourself back at the beginning of a check point or level. Dues Ex M'eh
1.0	The dual trigger buttons broke. They are made of cheap plastic and won't last long, especially if you play shooting games. I'm just a regular player not heavy user. The new version that just came up its no different, same plastic. And the battery life is too short also. I can't change them since warranty already expired. Just be careful when buying this, don't expect them to hold for a long time. Not worth price tag.
1.0	You cannot get past certain points of this game solo. This forces you into 'matchmaking' where you are at the mercy of other random strangers. Do not buy this for a kid, even a teen. It is 'online only' and broken in many ways. Loading times are horrendous. Now I'm locked out of my account. No reason is given. Probably returning this garbage. Broken. Not for kids.
1.0	The very beginning of the game frustrated me so much I never played it a 2nd time. One Star
1.0	Yes, here we have another bumbleheaded design idea from the Sony bigwigs in Japan, who have demonstrated time and again they are completely clueless when it comes to the American consumer.  After the disaster that has been the PS3 (3 years for a price cut on the worst selling current gen console?)  they have followed the PS3 division's brainstorm of removing features from the next version of hardware, but this time they are RAISING the price instead of lowering it.  On top of that, they promised to, then backed out of a trade-in or repurchase program for the millions of UMD discs people have been buying in good faith for almost 5 years now.  I have tried this console, and it is cramped, the analog nub is even more useless, and the screen size is smaller, all for $50 more than the Wii and Xbox 360 Arcade.  As Sony has eliminated themselves from almost every emerging electronics market; MP3 players, smart phones, personal communication devices, and now handheld consoles, it is clear more top brass needs to be replaced in their electronics divisions.  Please don't feed their lame ideas to force only first party software on you, the consumer.  As another reviewer said, stick with the PSP3000, it has all of these features, and sticks it to their digital distribution division, which I'm sure they think will save this sinking ship. Sony's Worst Idea Yet (And That's Saying Something)
1.0	BOICOTT THIS GAME! 60 dollar tag for a 30 dollar game. THERES NO OFFLINE CAMPAIGN, and I don't mean a story, theres basically no offline User vs Ai like old battlefronts. On top of that they announced it wouldnt have space battles. This game is basically a ripoff of 60 dollars for online multiplayer. Sure it may have offline survival, which gets boring after playing half and hour a few waves of enemis without an actual objective, other than survive. Developers shouldnt be allowed to release crap like this, then they expect us to buy the 50 dollar dlc tht will release eventually.  Do NOT support this. This is just a battlefield multiplayer with a star wars skin. DO NOT waste your money! theres basically no offline User vs Ai like old battlefronts
1.0	POS for real...worked one day,mic was horrible...dont buy horrible
1.0	this game is bad for achievements. I didn't enjoy the story either it was predictable. Also the multiplayer was horrible. I regret buying this game. Now it's going to be in my achievements list as an incomplete game. If I could rate this game with negative stars, I would. Horrible game
1.0	I ordered 2 of these cables for a new retro game setup and only 1 of them worked. From a quality standpoint these cords are absolute crap. I have my old original n 64 video cable and it has normal gold pin connectors in it these new cords if you shine a flashlight into the connection end you might see 1 pin. Just a horrible design , I don't recommend these to anyone try to get original nes cords for your nintendo console. Amazon thanks for the professionalism getting these delivered to my house. To bad company's benefit on selling junk. very generic nintendo av cables
1.0	"Pit Fighter for it's time was a good game. But even with games of it's time, it wasn't as great (this game came out in 1991). you could only be 3 characters, all of which were fairly decent and more or less the same with the addition of a few moves and subtraction of a few moves.
The only thing that really held this game up was it's challenge, it's bonus rounds and it's easy play. It was almost too easy at times. Plus you could use the entire screen to fight a match instead of scrolling left and right. It might not be worth buying because it gets real old real quick so maybe rent this one first. Too slow, it's almost too simple"
1.0	"Complaint one. This game is based on the alternate history of the Federation which was established in the latest movie (which I hated). I should have thought of that. Assumption of something else is my mistake. The game has none of the long established atmosphere of star-fleet and no feel of any of the long history, wardrobes or weapons from past shows and movies.

Complaint two. Massively multi-player means something totally different to me. The game keeps local player counts low with several schemes that make the game experience frustrating. I am unimpressed with the online experience. I am very disappointed. After playing real MMORPGs like Battleground Europe, this game is pathetic and 10 years behind.

Complaint three. Was this game originally designed to be played on a PC? I thought it was but it is as clumsy to control as any ""console ported to computer"" game I have ever bought. This game was beta like forever and a day and this is what I get? I feel ripped off. I expected so much more. I at least expected more freedom of movement and responsive control of the game character.

Complaint four. Why are the graphics so bad? I expected more modern standards. No eye candy here. Room based content with transitions keeping the action broken up. I know it's that way to limit bandwidth and server load and that makes it more insulting. Mostly distracting and a generic rendering at best. Rip off.

This Trek fan is very disappointed and I'd love to have my money back. If I had never played better online Massively multi player games, I'd maybe accept this as the best they could do. I know better. Boring, clunky UI and no Trek vibe at all. Read a lot before buying."
1.0	This thing picks up all background noise. And the people I'm playing get annoyed by it to where that mute me. I don't use it anymore. Save up for the TurtleBeach headsets! And the people I'm playing get annoyed by it to where that mute me
1.0	This version does not work in US playstation as I was sent a UK version. wrong region
1.0	W.O.W. = World of Walking.  A great travel simulator if you like pretending you're in an ancient world where burning shoe leather is a treat.  Not so fun IMO.  I bought this for the kids. W.O.W. = World of Walking.
1.0	"I'm glad I didn't spend much on this because I don't like it! They dropped the ball somewhere because this is nothing like the previous versions of The Sims for PC. While the game seems smoother when playing and not as jerky, there is so much missing from it!

In the Buy menu, I noticed several things missing from the previous versions--
*Electronics is very minimal. There is no burglar alarms anymore which also means there's probably no burglar Sims anymore either. I didn't even see a home phone to buy!
*I didn't see vehicles either like there was in The Sims 3!

The other thing I can't stand is when you leave one property and go to another, you see a load screen instead of being able physically to follow your Sim like you could in The Sims 3.

I seriously hope they make some drastic improvements upon this game because I'm tempted to GO BACK and continue where I left off with The Sims 3. This is just very disappointing and I hope that future Sims games for PC don't follow this track. WHAT DID THEY DO TO THE SIMS!?!?!?!"
1.0	Started playing this at closed beta. Horrid game such a disappointment. The world is empty. Don't waste your time and money. Failure
1.0	My 7-year-old son, who had an on-line account, was extremely disappointed in the DS version.  We did not purchase it through Amazon, and the salesman at the store led us to believe he'd have access to his on-line character and we wouldn't have to pay monthly fees any more.  Completely wrong information.  My son called the game a complete rip-off.  I feel so bad that now I plan to buy him a different game to make up for his complete and utter disappointment in this purchase. I'd give it zero stars if I could
1.0	I was so excited when I first bought this game. I raced home, popped it into my GBA played it for about 15 minutes, got up, and left to go do something else. I love Mario Kart, and if your reading this review about Krazy Racers I'm sure you've played it and like it too, and thats what Krazy racers is, a copy of Mario Kart, only 10x worse. Somehow, there isn't much track variety. Sure you'll go from an ice level to a space level to a stadium, bit some how, all the tracks just don't differ much from each other, in difficulty or anything. The characters, unless you've dedicated your long lasting life to Konami, chances are you probably won't know a whole bunch of them. The weapons are basically the same as in Mario Kart, just slightly different, blue rocket, red rocket, drill, and junk like that. The gameplay, well, for me did not do all that much. I was never in a moment where I had sweat dripping down my forehead with my palms sweating loosing grip of the controller and worrying that on the final lap if I don't win first I'll have game over and won't make it to the Super Cup. I never had one of those moments like I did in Mario Kart, the whole game just didn't pull me in. Graphics, good. Ok, my advice, please wait for Mario Kart Circuit, it should be a lot better with more famaliar characters for everybody(hopefully), and an overall better game. But this whole review is just my opinion. Game on. boring and, well, boring
1.0	"The interface artwork has been improved in Civ V over Civ IV and it stays true to the style of the game.  Another aspect I like, is that there are clouds in the game that represent the fog of war.  This creates a more pleasurable experience when playing and is more unique than the standard black color.  Terrain and unit models have all been updated, but only slightly.  My biggest complaint with this, is that the zoom feature is severely limited.  In a game where you build a world and craft thriving cities, you want to see those cities up close...and that isn't an option.

 The old square grid map has been replaced with hexagons, which is generally considered the standard among strategy gamers.  I agree with this and wish Civ IV had adopted this method.  Unit stacking has been removed which I agree with...who knows how many battles I've faced that lasted a century only because a single city had so many units stockpiled that I needed two or three times the number of units to conquer an inferior force.  It speeds up the conflict and lets you focus more on strategy than the monotony of unit production.

 Important advancements like politics and religion are no longer in the tech tree.  Instead, politics take the form of ""policies"" which your civilization adopts.  Religion doesn't show it's head.  I know many people play this simply as a game, but for those who are serious about history it can be detrimental.  How can it honestly be considered a civilization game where you can't discover democracy or advance your society from the belief of polytheism to monotheism?  I have yet to discover where the option for slavery is.  One key element in Civ IV was deciding how you would run your country for better or for worse, and dealing with other countries that had different beliefs.  So with the removal of both slavery and religion, is this truly a civilization game or just a politically correct one?

 Using an inverse idiom, this game truly is a sheep in wolf's clothing.  It carries the name Civilization, but is highly undeserving. Something Missing?"
1.0	There are few games that have made me this angry, I cannot believe how unfair this game is.  The resources are bull man, I never get salt paper and even if the computer has extra it refuses to trade with me, doesn't matter though I'd bring a ton of cavalries into japan and I'll just get chopped to bits by their samuri which seem to never end.  It seems like no matter how superior your units are the comp can just tear them up with it's endless supply of grunt units, it ain't right...  I loved Civ 2 back in the day and mastered it.  But this game is unforgiving, the diplomacy is a complete headache, if you want something you have to pay an arm and a leg and you have to give away all your secrets.  I don't know, I liked 2 better, maybe 4 is good but my computer sucks... ugh.  Don't waste your time. Rage.
1.0	"A few days back  went out a got the game its only 20 bucks and theres a reason. You can only play as Yellow, Blue and Red, but even more only as there Zords. You can't even play the rangers...personally i think thats kinda silly.

I was hoping it was like the old SEGA Game from the MMPR movie, that was a good game...made no sense but it was fun...you can get the game if you want too 20 bucks for a PS2 game won't bust your bank, but if your looking for a old style PR game with hand to hand cobat with foot solders...Giant Robo fighting is all you got here A Old PR Fan's Review"

1.0	"This game is so shallow it's like a kiddie pool.  From the exploration, to the questing, crafting, instances, character customization, items/loot, flying, abyss, guild management tools, UI, etc, EVERYTHING is paper thin and screams of a f2p game.  The world is perhaps the most linear I have ever seen in an mmo and you can only fly unrestricted in the abyss.  If you haven't gotten to level 25 people will tell you that's where the game opens up and becomes fun.  Um, no.  Take all 3 layers of the abyss and put them together and you have the size of one zone approximately since most of it is islands and open space.  The fortress and artifact battles seem intriguing at first until you realize that there really is no big benefit to having control of one of these things.  Questing in the abyss is beyond boring as it is in any other part of the game and the dungeons/instances are the most uninspired I have ever seen.  Oh yeah, and expect to run instances multiple times and not have any boss drop loot.  LITERALLY, even end bosses of a dungeon will often times drop LITERALLY nothing.  NOTHING.

I got to level 30 in this game and realized that everything that was supposed to be fun wasn't, and why keep going in this disaster.  Perhaps this game will be to your liking, but it definitely wasn't to mine. A free-to-play MMO charging a subscription fee."

1.0	"It's a Star Wars game, but it's a pretty bad one. Ok, the graphics look awesome, as a multi-player game I could see this being good. Single player mode can have two extreems, easy or hard. Those aren't selectable settings, but the way you choose to play. At each ""level"" your character becomes immediately involved in a large battle, your character is one of many fighting this battle and there are no specific goals other than taking over command post. You can elect to piloting ships, steal an AT-AT etc.. but this really only serves to bring  a loose bit of freedom. It makes the game a giant mush without any order to it. You can fall back and let the computer controlled team mates win the level for you or you can engage in combat and (usually) be destroyed almost immediately. Bottom line, this is a poor game. One of the worst Star Wars games ever made. Save your money. I don't understand all the postive reviews..."

1.0	"The quality on this mouse is terrible. Oh, it looks flashy enough, but all it takes is scrolling the scroll wheel to feel just how cheaply made this mouse is. Logitech mice have fallen terribly if this is the type of thing they're making now.

Also, while it's nice Logitech isn't like many other ""gaming"" mice companies and still have left/right scroll, whoever at Logitech thought it was a good idea to make it touch sensitive, rather than an actual click, is bonkers beyond belief. It triggers so insanely easily, that it'll just randomly left/right click as you scroll the wheel. Sure, if you keep it as left/right scroll, often you may not notice, since-especially in a video game-it has no real function, but if you were to bind those to something else (ie: keys, to give you more hotkeys on your mouse)...lol...holy hell.

Lastly, again, more flash than substance. They have a thumb button that's far forward. Fine. But, if your hand is gripping the mouse where that button makes any sense, then the two buttons meant to be tapped by your forefinger make zero sense, as they are massive, forcing the behind button so far behind that you have to either drag your hand back off the mouse to tap it, or contract your finger a ton. The forward button clearly should have been the location for both buttons, where your forefinger naturally sits, and it's certainly massive enough that if it had been split in half into two buttons, you still wouldn't mistake either one. Again, this mouse was clearly designed by some art student or something than someone who actually uses a mouse.

The ""fantastic"" reviews for this thing boggle the mind. Quite possibly the worst mouse I've ever used."
1.0	Very annoying to install even for somebody with a lot of experience with gaming hardware. The stick was too firm, and would often get stuck. I was better off with the loose stick my controller had. good idea, bad execution.
1.0	is hard to use hard to plug in accessories of the wii into One Star
1.0	I tried playing mass effect with this controller and it caused the main character to keep turning left. I would not recommend it. Didn't work right
1.0	"This sale is obviously a ripoff for those customers who don't know what's going on or not paying attention. Amazon staff if you're reading this, do something.

The PSN service and their cards are great, but make sure you buy ones SOLD by and FULFILLED by amazon Amazon should take this down"
1.0	this game is not fullfilling the graphics are terrible and all you have to do it put in a simple code and you beat it...if you like racing games (which i dont) you will find this game frustrating and hard...for once in my lifetime I am telling you not to buy this xbox game... very boring
1.0	Really Dissapointed,don't buy til the game is complete,once again the people who buy game at launch are the ones who get screwed Crapcom......nuff said
1.0	First of all, what were the people who designed this mat thinking??? It's ugly and the colors clash. Also, soft mats slip around way too much. You can't beat hard songs and it is frustrating even getting good scores on the easy songs. The response on soft mats is unreliable and unpredictable. If you want to enjoy DDR, you're going to have to shell out for the expensive hard pads. Sorry people, there is no cheap way out of this one. And don't let any seller convince you that foam on the bottom of a soft mat or an anti-slip cover will make it better, because it won't. Don't use soft mats if you want good gameplay
1.0	This is the most boring and repetitive game I've ever seen.  You just click on things to do them in the right order and quick enough.  That's it, clicking on things, that's not a game and it sure isn't worth paying form.  HORRIBLE Hell's Kitchen not even close
1.0	"Well after playing FF11 on the PC for its first few years and coming back to it in the past week the physical game itself is certainly improved for anybody starting out fresh in the world of FF11.

However because of a large dashboard update to the Xbox 360 Platform many months ago its apparently put FF11 into a MAJOR state of shock... there are serious issues that have made me close my account within five days and that are completely unrelated to the solid, physical gameplay...

Installation takes a little over an hour and the update, a few hours more (Give or take 4 hours on cable internet).

You MUST Log Out of FF11, log out of the play online viewer and CLOSE play online viewer from within itself.  If you EVER shutdown your console from within the game itself OR the playonline menu OR use quickmenu to switch to anther game without selecting close from the login screen, your entire game is corrupted!

EVERY time this happens you are forced to reformat the ENTIRE HARD DRIVE!!! Thats right, 3 calls to technical support and that is the ""solution""... more like contingency plan... If you happen to have two complete xbox 360 consoles there are ways to TRICK it into showing you the error message thats blocking you but most of us have a single system.

Further more, the game is not on your games list, its stored in cache which means that if you go to clear the system cache it will corrupt your copy of FF11 also prompting another reformat.

There was no forewarning of this at any time during installation.  After experiencing 4 hours, I logged out of the game.  At the POL menu, logged out of that, then used my controller to power down the system.  After coming home from campus today it throws legions of Disc Read Errors at you which are NOT disc read errors.  This is a problem documented all over the place on the internet.

This is also not a problem you can fully control.  During a garrison the system locked up on me after the first reformat (as well as a few other random times) and since you didn't exit through the play online viewer... here goes another 5 hours...

This is reformat 5, every time I talk to their customer support I get total bull... Its a complete shame that such a solid game is destroyed by lack of support from a company that I used to have extremely high regards for in which now has given me some of the worst customer service of my life.

DO NOT buy this game for the XBOX 360 System EVER!  Buy it for the PC or the Playstation.  If you happen to have a second Xbox 360 console lying around, then by all means give it a shot.  Outside of that extreme technical block, the controls worked solid and there were ZERO issues outside of this.  But an issue this big and time consuming destroys any likely hood of advancing in such an immense game.

There are solutions for this but since the game randomly froze up during gameplay, you are forced into this situation.  You shouldn't have to play music on your xbox (which most of us don't have on the machine) and even then this solution doesn't always work.  The game is just broken and unfortunately this is what they had to do to make this work on the XBox.  Poor design and a disappointment for a long term PC player. Solid game with beyond poor platform support"
1.0	never got to play. the graphics kept messing up even though it loaded in the computer One Star
1.0	lousy checkpoints times, first person platforming and repetitive game play do not combine well. This game sucks. rinse and repeat and occasionally fall off of a cliff.
1.0	I must say that this is one of the worst games I have played since Outpost. The manual is utterly useless. It has hardly any solid information about the controls or flow of the game. The controls are non-intuitive and sluggish. The game play is very poor and kluggy. This game is so bad, I thought there must be a patch for it. But I was wrong. I am playing this on a P4 H/T with a GB of RAM and a G-Force video card. Unless you enjoy disappointment, avoid this game at all cost. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
1.0	"Dull. Dull game play. Drive here. Drive there. Make money. Lose it all. Rinse. repeat. and oh so slow..Poor fighting mechanics.
The atmosphere and music and art are lovely. The game is slow and dull. Play Saints Row 2 or 3 instead."
1.0	This is really unfair pricing. Just because the item is hard to find, the price gets ratcheted up to $60 plus shipping and handling. I wrote an earlier review stating the same thing but it was denied. It's a $20 peripheral. Anyone paying 2, 3 and even 4 times the price for this (I've seen it listed for $80+ here) is getting a terrible deal. You can order these straight from Nintendo for $26.05 ($19.99 plus $6.05 in tax and shipping/handling). I did and mine just came in today. I do a lot of shopping on this site and usually love it, however, the pricing of these CPP's and my reviews (which follow their guidelines) being censored is a little frustrating. I thought this was supposed to be about getting the best deal, even when it comes to hard-to-find items. We're talking about a CPP, not an original, unopened NES here. Completely agree with other reviewers
1.0	After the family fun pack I vowed never to buy another stuff pack again.  But stupidly I let myself believe I was missing something so I caved and bought this.  After all, my favorite custom content downloads are kitchen and bathroom stuff.  This stuff pack was not worth 20 bucks it wasn't even worth 10.  The new stuff is boring, ugly and not much.  Save your money and download some custom stuff off the internet, the quality is waaay better. When will I learn!!
1.0	"Freezes in all modes. Unplayable as is today. I've played numerous games without any issues. co-op & single player useless. NO SUPPORT OF ANY KIND!!!

40 day old PC. NO issues of any kind. NO overclocks. UP TO DATE DRIVERS.

I've uninstalled it. I'll Try again to play around Xmas. No Game"
1.0	"The mechanics of this fighting game work fine, though it's hardly the spectacular title that the crossover of these two legendary franchises should have been. What overshadows all aspects of this game, however, is Capcom's unforgivable decision to lock away content on the disc, and string their customers along by making them pay more and more over time- simply to access the content they've already paid $60 for!

With the booming success of the games industry, it's hard to believe that anything could lead it to ruin in a repeat of the industry collapse of the 1980s. But if anything could lead to such disaster, it's THIS. Consumers must unite in their rejection of the approach that Capcom has used for this product. We must continue to make it known to the industry that this is not an acceptable practice.

This is the epitome of greed and unethical business practice. It helps nobody, and hurts us all- the publishers, the consumers, and the industry as a whole. For the sake of us all, may this never happen again. An unrepentant cash grab"
1.0	"Bought this game very cheap, as it is from a publisher I normally love and trust.

Hailed as being an ""extreme"" RPG, I thought a little challenge could be fun (just got done played a series of fun, but easy games.)  Plus, it was cheap.

This RPG game is only ""extreme"" in how bad it is...  The difficulty in this game comes from a completely random, roulette wheel battle style, and the fact that every challenge in the game require level 30+ skills to overcome, when you're at level 2.  Seriously, you will encounter a barrel, a door, or a treasure chest and not be able to do anything, right at the beginning of the game.  You later find out it takes a level 30 skill to break or open anything.

So, you walk around what is basically a board game playing field, moving a stationary character drawing one space at a time, while random pictures flash in the background.  Occasionally you get in a random battle, which is where the roulette attack wheel comes in.  All your skills are put on a fast spinning wheel, and what you land on is what you do.

Or, you encounter a trap.  If this happens, you use the same wheel to try and avoid it, which it early levels, is something like a 1/19 odds.

The battles present another huge problem.  You have your standard HP, and you have LP.  LP is your life points, and if a character is attacked while in KO (after HP reaches 0, typically) you lose an LP, and when LP is gone, you're dead for real.  You get shocking little LP... like 2 or 3 at most... which wouldn't be too much of a problem except tiny monsters in random battles do LP damage while you still have full HP!  So, at full HP, a 2 hit kill monster can hit you for an unavoidable 2 LP... possibly killing a character.  This makes HP completely useless...

I never found an item that could cure LP, either.

There are multiple characters you can play, with different storylines.  A good feature, but the stories (played out through a very few still picture/word sequences) were bland and confused, and none of them sparked my interest enough to possibly warrent played through such an unfun wreck of a game.

Not even worth the incredibly cheap price and shipping.  Stay away.

If you want an ""extreme"" or challenging RPG with great story, great gameplay try the Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga series. One of the worst games I've played..."
1.0	RE6 sucks!  My friend and I only played jake/ sherry's campaign and found it a total waste of time.  Capcom better return to the spooky forests, creepy castles, and errie lakes in the next RE game.  There is nothing scary about china or places resembling eastern europe.  At one point you have to disable AA guns and out run a stupid tank.  At least its not like DMC 2 where you had to fight off a possessed military gear.  **Luckly at the time of purchase, I also got borderlands 2.  Once my friend and I started playing that we never went back to RE 6. sucks re balls!!
1.0	"This is the same story with Fallout 3, and it was no surprise that it was going too be the same in New Vegas. The irony of it all though, is that most of the bugs and glitches and freezing issues in Fallout 3 carry over into New Vegas. It's clear this company knows they have a faithful audience of fan boys that will regardless buy this game, even though it's a unfinished product. They will continue too keep doing this, because the game sells a lot of units at launch. And these so called ""patches"" that usually claim to fix most of the serious issues don't, so it's loss and loss situation. If you were lucky too get this game when Black Friday was around, good for you. Full price for this game? NO! NO! NO! Until people stop being so quick with buying these games at launch, is the day you'll see change in productivity, and quality."
1.0	"The campaign is alright.
Multiplayer is really bad
Zombies is kind of dumb.

Pros:
- the legacy edition comes with a special version of the standard IW disc so there is NO CODE REQUIRED to install MW remastered
- you seem to be able to play MW without even installing IW as I was given 3 install options (modern warfare, iw, or both)

CONS:
-SUPPLY DROPS IN MODERN WARFARE REMASTERED (GUNS AND OTHER WEAPONS HAVE APPEARED IN THEM -1 stars for that (if i could give it)
- you have to download MW off of the Internet !?!?!?! THIS DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF BUYING A PHYSICAL COPY OF THE GAME!!! Why didn't ACTIVISION give us a second install disc that contains the MW game data?!?!?!?! This also eliminates any appeal to game collectors

MINUS THREE STARS FOR THAT ACTIVISION... NO EXCEPTIONS... THAT IS JUST WRONG!!!! Some Pros BUT ARE ALL SQUASHED BY CONS"
1.0	I am still pissed off at myself for buying this pathetic excuse of a game. I loved Diablo 2 but this, this is garbage even after a year this game still blows. Items are garbage the only way to get a good item is to brows the auction house or spend real money (which is retarded) This game does not reward you for grinding your ass off. People play hours and hours a day only to get pathetic items and scrap them. If you don't play games a lot this game is not for you simply because you will not get anywhere in it. Its boring there are millions of add bots spamming the chat channel this is not a game this is a marketing program for ingame items. I hate it
1.0	"Like Mass Effect from EA before it (and unfortunately a number of other recent titles), EA has infected this with ""Activation"" DRM. They get your money, but you don't own a copy. You can only install/reinstall it if you have an internet connection, their server is running (it won't be forever), and you haven't installed it twice before (which you could end up doing just deciding what system to run it on).

Completely unacceptable. Buy games where you actually OWN a copy of the game after spending money. Boycott ""Activation"" DRM"
1.0	i cant stop spending money on this free too play game very good game
1.0	Would you do what the title says? No, then don't buy this. If these things are actually selling maybe I should start listing them for 26. Hey you give me 28 dollars and I will give you 20 dollars that you can only spend at one shop
1.0	"Clearly, a lot of people really love this game. I'm not saying they're wrong, just that I personally don't get the appeal. I love playing offline shooter games (Bioshock, GTA4, Fallout 3, Mass Effect, Halo 3, etc.) and got this because of all the 5-star ratings on here, but I quit playing after the first couple of ""missions"" (or whatever they are called). Unlike other games I mentioned, there seems to be little or no strategy involved. It's just an endless repetition of walking around and then wildly blasting away as fast as you can. Where's the fun in that? I Don't Get It"
1.0	Not a Complete MW game,,missing all of the co op special missions which is whi i bought it,,,also 45 hrs of download time from sony at 88plus gigs,only saving grace is the cheat code possibilities,,,amazon should tell buyers that it is not a complete game more than half is missing 88 and 55 gig download took 45 hrs
1.0	"The game cannot be played w/o the actual ""Wonderbook"". So, it is useless, and a rip off. Buyer Beware"
1.0	"I deleted my old review and am replacing it with this one star middle finger review.

1.  A internet connection is needed...that fact isn't listed in the manufacture's discription.
2.  Minimal requirements....that fact isn't listed in the manufacture's discription either.

Here are the minimum system requirements;

OS  Windows XP.  (I'm runnin vista 32 bit and it runs fine.)
CPU  Intel Pentium 4 supporting HT technology AMD Athlon 64
Ram  512 MB (Windows XP) 1 GB (Windows Vista
Hard Drive  8.0 BG
Monitor 800x600
DVD-ROM drive  DVD9 compatible
Video Card VRAM 256 MB. DirextX 9.0c/ Shader 3.0 NIVIDIA GeForce 6600 series
Sound DirectSound compatible; DirectX 9.0c (PC audio solution containing Dolby Digital Live required for Dolby Digital audio)
Imput Devices  Mouse. Keyboard
Internet  Broadband connection required for online battle.

Anyway, I don't have broadband but I wasn't gonna battle any of you and you don't need it to get this thing running.  But the internet is needed to get it running.

The game itself runs okay....but it was more movie than game.  I would have given it a solid three stars.

Finally, check my reviews on 'the Orange Box/F.E.A.R. 2/Mass Effect, to see where I'm coming from in all these low star ratings.

bye. Warning!"
1.0	If you are a fan of previous CIV games, this game will be as welcome as pee in your cereal.  First of all, 2K wants access to your computer and requires an internet connection to do anything.  Matter of fact, be prepared for a LONG download once you enter the 25-digit security key code.  2K got it wrong and in a major way!  They have also gotten LAZY because the game has MANY BUGS AND GLITCHES! Not to mention they have done away with the wonder movies.  If I could get my money back, I would in a second. This is one of the worst games I have purchased. The mighty has fallen!
1.0	I hadn't played an FF game for a long time, so I picked up FFX, hoping that all the good pub this game got would be true.  Alas, it was not.  FFX was a wretched game, no doubt.  Disgusted after spending 40 hours, I went back into the series, having heard that the earlier games were better.  My best buy had FFVIII on sale for like $15, so I bought it, figuring it couldn't be worse than X.  I was wrong.  Where to begin?  I'll start with the music, which is really repetitive.  It's really not even that good.  Next, the storyline, which is SO bizzare.  So Edea is the enemy.  No, she's being possessed by some other person.  Who you've never heard mentioned.  Not once, until the 3rd disc.  WTF?  The draw/junction system is horrendous as well.  Why can't I use the MP system?  But my biggest complaint with this game is the GFs.  At least by FFX they were smart enough to have the option to eliminate the intro scene.  NO such option here.  And I looked HARD.  Each one requires a year and a day to summon, so you just sit and watch Leviathan materialize, create a slide, and drop water down it.  How impressive.  If each character is summoning a GF, you could get up, drive 3 hours away to pick up some shoes on the side of the road, come back home, make dinner, eat, go to the bathroom, and sit back down and Pandemona would still be firing its attack.  And you can't avoid this, because your characters are so weak physically, that you must use them at least twice a battle.  In the event you find enough items to improve your weapon, this amount decreases, but you still use nothing but GFs during boss fights.  You don't even use real magic!  Why?  because using magic takes away defense points from your junction system!  You may use heal and status magics, but blacks are out of the question.  Besides, they're weaker than the GFs!  Even when triple cast, a triple cast blizzaga is weaker than Shiva!  Who thought of this?  I'm about 1/3 way through the 3rd disc, and I really don't even want to finish it.  When I found out the same people who designed this game designed X, it came to me as no surprise.  So many bad things about this game were evident in X, it was eerie.  Shame on square for allowing the makers of this game to make X. Awful
1.0	Need I say more. I was so frustrated at this game I went back and played shogun 2. Since that game is finally finished it looks amazing. Go play that and then buy this when its five dollars and all the bugs are fixed. buggy as buggy can be
1.0	Between game-breaking glitches (ie., hitting a checkpoint right as you die and needing to restart the level), lost game save files (still a problem), frustrating hit detection online, issues connecting to games online, new glitches being presented with each subsequent patch, and the fact that these issues still exist 3 months after launch, this will be my first and last Battlefield title. I played the Titanfall beta more in 5 days than Battlefield in 3 months because of all the issues with this game. It is clear that DICE and EA released an incomplete product in the interest of launching with next-gen consoles, and the experience has been atrocious. They probably could have used another 6 months to get the game into stable condition, but I've given up on this game and the franchise. First and Last Battlefield
1.0	"Any fun this game could have had is instantly destroyed by the shaky cam, enforced third person viewpoint where one third of your viewscreen screen is constantly blocked by the main character's back.  The lack of a first person perspective+getting rid of the nausea inducing wobble cam shows this game to be pure consolitus.

PC gamers don't support Bioware, they're just a cheap console gaming company nowadays, evidenced by the fact they refused to put a first person perspective OPTION into the PC port.

If Bioware release a future patch that offers a first person perspective, I'll re-edit this review, but until then I'll tell every PC gamer in sight to avoid this console port like the plague. Consolitus"
1.0	"I'll start with the good.
- Speakers in headset offer crisp sound
- product looks great, especially when plugged in

unfortunately thats all the good i could think of, on to the bad.

- Awful microphone, sounds like you are talking with the mic in your mouth. Even after an hour of messing with settings, couldn't get rid of the extreme muffling of the voice. best i can describe is it sounds like a charlie brown teacher when you talk.
- They do not fit well, because of the design, the bottom of the earpieces stick out a little and feel weird on your ears.
- While the lights look cool, it is kinda pointless to waste a USB plug for something you can't even see until you take them off

I do not recommend this headset, i have used many headsets in the past (destroyed by dog which is why im in the market) I decided for the price even if it was awful it wasn't that big of a loss, but knowing how terrible the mic is, i don't want anyone else to waste their money either. Spend an extra $5 and get something better... I'll start with the good. - Speakers in headset offer crisp sound - ..."
1.0	"Cute...as a 24 year old gamer (at the more casual end of hardcore)...I really wanted to like this game. It seemed quite original and inspired...I had tons of fun for the first hour, then the fun rapidly dropped off into frustration and boredom. The first few levels I played, I looked everywhere for things to collect; but, after a few levels, I stopped looking and went through the levels as fast as I could ... assuming a point to the game would emerge later on -- it didn't.

So, single player was a pretty huge failure for me. It didn't engage my interest for very long, so I tried it in 2 player mode with my 28 year old girl friend. She thought it was pretty cute, and she kind of enjoyed it. The idea of collecting outfits suited her better, but she wouldn't play more than 1 level a week - if she played at all...but she doesn't and neither do I.

If mindlessly collecting cutesy ""things"" to outfit your character and placing stickers on objects in a game is your thing, you will love this game. The game isn't any more interesting if my sack is wearing a zebra outfit or is naked....it's all mindlessly boring. Unfortunately, I believe the game suffers from a poor vision...somebody came up with an interesting idea (although not as original as people think) idea but couldn't think of any use for it...the result was a semi-original, but utterly pointless, unengaging game. Perhaps the shred of originality is to be credited not to the idea that nobody has thought of it before, but nobody was dumb enough to implement it because they assumed nobody would actually play it.

Some of you can relate to this comparison well: Counterstrike...except you can change your outfit, you don't do anything except jump around a level without interacting with anybody. Placing stickers is like tagging things...imagine how long that'd be fun...running around a level, changing your clothes, and tagging things with cute pictures.

I can't recommend this game to anybody except MAYBE (and that's a big maybe) kids ... young girls more than boys. Unfortunately, in the end, it was a waste of money for me. Cute...and painfully boring."
1.0	"I hope this works. Amazon ate my last attempt at a review for this title.

I had very high hopes for this game. Neverwinter Nights was and remains one of my favorite PC RPGs. It was incredibly rich, detailed, and deep. The editor provided days' worth of fun customizing.

This title, however, feels like a regression rather than a progression. And I can't for the life of me understand how they can release a title that demands so much more out of your hardware for a game that looks like it was released three years earlier than the original.

But that's not the part that bothered me; graphics have never been a big selling point with me. They're nice, don't get me wrong, but I'll take a game with great play value and ugly visuals over a pretty trainwreck.

Unfortunately, this game has neither, mainly because someone back at Atari or Bioware royally messed up.

Here's the short version: Despite having more than double (that's 200% of) the system requirements for this game, my machine was unable to produce more than 1 frame per second.

Let me repeat that. 1 frame per second. For those of you who don't play enough to make the connection between playability and frames-per-second, 1FPS is completely unplayable. Imagine loading a game that's way too advanced for your machine, and the graphics that would result when your computer tried to run it. That's the kind of performance I got out of NWN 2--using a machine built in 2007, attempting to display graphics that were out of date in 2000. Frankly, that's jaw-dropping. How could they not realize they were putting out such a flawed product when the original was so great? Maybe they got overconfident and stopped trying, thinking they could just ride on NWN's lapels for the rest of their careers.

And now I just know there are some folks out there dying to tear me down to size by commenting that there are a number of fixes for this terrible framerate (since I'm far from the only person to experience it, it seems an entire small community has sprung up around attempting to fix NWN2.)

Let me just head y'all off at the pass, there. I've tried them. All of them. Every single possible fix I could find, from modifying my graphics card settings, to game settings, to custom-written mods. The best I could achieve, after setting every possible graphical option to minimum and increasing the performance of my card, was 1.5FPS.

Skip this title. Get something that will run on your machine. Given the resources this aged-looking RAM monster seems to want, you're better off waiting to play this title until sometime in 2020, when 20GHz processors, 10 gig video cards and 30 gigs of RAM are standard PC options. Has to function before it can be good."
1.0	"I live in China but it's not my mother tongue. All I want to do is play Starcraft II on the local Chinese servers in English. This was possible in Starcraft: Brood War, released in 1998. In fact, playing on any server in any available language was possible. But Activision-Blizzard does not allow cross-region play for Starcraft II. They don't even let you play on a LAN with your friends, which means some amount of lag is always going to be present, even if you're right next to your opponent. All of this was doable 12 years ago. Activision-Blizzard has never satisfactorily explained why these features have not been implemented in Starcraft II.

The end result is that the community has been balkanized based on country and language. And if you happen to live in a region that doesn't support your language, or want to play someone from another country or region, well, tough luck. This game is not for you. Feels like a big ""Eff You"" from Activision-Blizzard..."
1.0	More of a annoyance the anything close to fear. Constantly having to redo bosses and areas in a horror game is just annoying. How can you be scared when you are frustrated and see the same level and enemies over and over. Not a very well designed game. Hardcore gamers will probably like it, but if you just want to enjoy a gaming experience there are other much better options. Constantly having to redo bosses and areas in a horror game is just annoying. How can you be scared when you are ...
1.0	"Merchandise so bad from Steam Servers.

So bad game, I can't say an opinion about the game without the Steam' services  but is terrible from Steam Server while Install. Steam said 13 hours connected for down load all things,  so long time, I don't understand because my computer is so fast the problem is Steam's  server. Finally  I Clouse the install without finish I don' believe that I can 't play a game at all like this. Conclusion in my opinion the game is only one star and I don't recommended, may be will be better without Steam, never will buy a game where appear Steam. Really, I felt so frustrated when I try it. From now I don't install any game that use Steam .  Amazon must alert customers if they  need  connected to Steam ""all the time to play a game"". It must Show as System requirements, Please advise the customers in the future in this way  we have an option so we don't loss money and time. The customers will be very glad. The service from Amazon and the shipping was so good , but the merchandise so bad. Thanks. Merchandise so bad from Steam Servers"
1.0	"I will make this short, many others already reviewed ME3 and it's a great game, BUT

It's like a bad Roller Coaster, its a great ride, until you get to the end and puke
Or the titanic, Great ride until you hit the iceberg and sink.

That is basically mass effect 3 and read below to understand why, just remember this friendly advice, ""Stay away from ME3""

It's clear the game was not complete and rushed to get released, the ending was total mess/answers nothing/solve nothing and there was no conclusion neither anyone knows what happened really, the developers notes (Released in application ""mass effect final hours"") make it clear that they were starting to create ME3 ending in NOVEMBER and had no idea what to do, they admit they were limited by time and scraped ton of things because it was hard to put ingame, they will probably ask for a $$ DLC to give you the ending, honestly stay away until at least this issue is fixed

Another issue is the ""Must be online to play Mass Effect 3 single player"" yes single player that was not a typo (Only effects digital users)
If your save file ever used the DLC ""from ashes"" you won't be able to load that single player save file unless you connect to EA servers to confirm that you own the installed dlc, it happens every time you want to play single player, most people in bioware forums are effected by this, some are not so we really don't know what is the cause and bioware basically doesn't care to address this issue yet (They are too busy to damage control what their ending caused) Waste of time plus WARNNING for digital version customers"
1.0	This game has not aged well at all. Quite frankly the quality of final fantasy games has been waning. This game is just boring as hell. wish it was the final fantasy
1.0	ok look its a call of duty game so it is just like the rest it sucks! and for that i will never buy a nrw call of duty game again lame
1.0	"Worst game in the sims franchise. I wasted eighty dollars on this hot mess. After 120 hours the game quickly became boring. The world is no longer open world. The world has ten--I repeat TEN lots in each world and no there is no create a world tool to add more lots.
If you want your sims to go to a community lot you must first wait through a loading screen. You can see your neighbors houses but if you want to actually go there then you have to endure yet another loading screen. If you want to go anywhere that's not your sims house then you'll have to endure another loading screen. The world is dead. Story progression has been completely erased. If you want the two towns to progress then you'll have to play the families in order for the town to progress. Want your sims to own a car? Too bad, there are no cars in this game AT ALL. You know that wonderful tutorial that's provided for new simmers? Want to turn it off? Guess what: You can't. Want cute pictures with toddlers and adult sims? Too bad, toddlers have been removed. Want cute babies? Too bad, babies are just objects. Teenagers are the same height as adults. Want to use create a style? Too bad. Want a normal job? Too bad. Want to hire an npc? Too bad.  Once again pets and weather are NOT in the base game. Surely by now these would be basic features in a life simulator. There are no baby sitters. Instead your baby magically disappears for a while until your adult sims return to the lot. Sims only have three-- I repeat THREE traits you can choose from plus their aspirations. The boat and train in the background is decor. Your sims can't ride the boat/train. Sims gain skills way too easy in this game. After an hour of sim time my sim reached level ten of the painting skill. I could write so much more on what I hate about the sims 4 but this review is getting entirely too long. This game was NOT worth eighty dollars! Basically the sims 2 with better graphics"

1.0	I was obessed with resident evil 4 so much I bought it on three different consoles but this game made me want to scream. I paid $80 for the limited edition and ended up selling it to game stop for $20. My biggest problem was the girl who follows you around and does nothing but die and steals your ammo. They use some the same exact scene from resident evil 4 an example a truck comes right towards you and you have to kill the driver. Do they we are stupid save your money and buy resistance 1 or 2. What were they thinking?

1.0	Try to instal it on two computers. no succes. needs to be easy to instal
1.0	"the only advantage to purchasing the cd set is that it comes with a manual / playbook.  but you will get the ""anox.exe encountered a problem and needs to close"" error, so you will have to download the digital version from gog.  i am playing the digital version, and find it ok.  you walk around talking to people, and if you like games like that, ... .  i prefer strategy games like starcraft and warcraft.  homeworld is good also.
with homeworld, i could put my system to standby, and when it came out of standby, i could pick up where i left off.  it was that stable.  homeworld's gameplay is flawless.  just about the only other game that played this well, of the classics, is starseige tribes, and you need to download an update to play that because all the original servers are no longer up.
i loved the stability of homeworld, that it played perfectly out of the box.
i can't say the same of arachronox, which constantly gives me ""anox.exe encountered a problem and needs to close"".  i couldn't find a patch.  i downloaded the gog version, which plays well.
xeno clash, installed steam then stopped.

about the game:
i have never got to play arachronox without encountering some problem.  the gameplay is horrible.  get starseige or homeworld or starcraft.  (update: i've been running the gog version of this game and it is stable.) homeworld and starseige tribes are better games ..."
1.0	XBOX One is garbage. Do not buy this system unless you want to pay a monthly fee and only have access to the games you purchased if your internet is up. If you play with Xbox One online, PC players will destroy you. Fact!. XBOX One is garbage.
1.0	"The flaws in this game are myriad in number. The most prominent is that you can pay $100 and not be able to come close to completion. You only get three characters and you cannot even complete ANY of the free play with these characters. All you get is story mode, three miserable adventure worlds, and only three red bricks. This games is not even really that much bigger than all the other Lego games that have come out in the past 3 years, and I have played all of the them so I know what I'm talking about. The worlds on Lego Dimensions are so small that Minas Tirith is only about fifty feet away from Hobbiton in the Lord of the Rings world! To those who are wondering if they should buy this game, I would say that you can buy three or four other really good and enjoyable LEGO games for less than the price of this partial game. Lego Batman 2 has a Gotham City free world which is much larger than any world than this game has. The Middle-Earth of Lego The Lord of the Rings is at least three times bigger than this game's version. Lego Marvel has a large free world New York and in Lego Batman 3 you can visit all of the Lantern Worlds. Furthermore, in all of these games, you can buy all of the characters, complete all of the free play, collect all of the gold bricks and red bricks, and complete the game to 100%. The best part is that you can buy all of this for less than what Lego is now charging for one INCOMPLETE game.  People have said that this game is worth $100 and more , but I would say that several complete Lego games that are still perfectly fun, entertaining, and valid are worth FAR FAR more. I would spare anyone the expense of this game in favor something cheaper and just as lastingly good.

A flaw that I see in the Starter Pack is that legos come with it. The legos alone that are involved send the price out the roof. At least with other games you could choose whether or not to buy corresponding legos, and if did want to then you could pick and choose which ones to buy in relation to how much money you could afford to spend at the time. I am not against the legos that come with this game. I just don't think you should have to pay the extra expense just to receive the game. The old system of buying legos and Lego games separately is better and definitely a lot cheaper.

When someone completes this game to 100%, please comment on how much it costed to do so.

For further entertainment, check out the older LEGO games that came out on the PS3 like LEGO Indiana Jones, LEGO Batman, and LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga. Although these games do not have open worlds, flight, and other things that the newer games have, it is their simplicity and fun that made LEGO games popular. They cost about $20 each. I would say that you can buy three or four other really good and enjoyable LEGO games for less than the price ..."

1.0	socom is best when played online. well, it was but not anymore. now it is impossible to have a decent game online. too many cheaters (people with rapid fire rockets, double health, invulnerability), vehicles that can climb mountains, invisible vehicles, pistols more powerful than an assault rifle, and many othe glitches!!! i had been waiting for a long time for the developer to fix the problems but they're not doing anything at all. don't waste your money on this one!!! too many bugs! crappy online play!
1.0	I was greatly disappointed with this wrestling game. To start off, the Xbox 360 game comes with no printed manual at all. So you can only go to Options to controller for what it offers. The game only offers 4 moves. strike ,grapple, finisher, and break free. That's it!!! If there are other moves in the game they are not mentioned at all. So you are stuck with a wrestler of your choice to try to figure out what you can do with him when all he can do is strike and back off. Absolutely terrible game. Secondly, ONLY half of the wrestlers you like are unlocked in this game. The other half are LOCKED and you can only unlock them by wining matches. I'm talking about 30 locked players. How can you unlock these other wrestlers with only 4 moves in the game? The game offers an online pass which you must pay an additional $9.00 for. So you wind up paying $59 + $9 for this piece of crap. With tax you wind up paying $70 for a horrible wrestling game. Please do not but this game Worst wrestling game ever made

1.0	"two words, epic fail.

1>HUD stick next to your character is bad idea.  ubisoft might think is cool, but it really is NOT.  HUD failed to properly display:
  -skill cooldown.  it is just black and white box.  it is eye sore.
  -the way ammo, grenade, and medic kit are displayed on HUD is not inspiring.  aweful epic fail

2>there is NO UI for direction pad action button (right for medic kit, left for grenad cycle).  medic kit and grenade are not infinite.  it will be common sense to display direction pad with action name with quantity.  epic fail for not including it

3>double tap to switch to handgun?  so what is so wrong about press triangle one time to swap and cycle thru weapon?  again epic fail

4>quest tracking is aweful epic fail.  it seems to display current quest in a tiny almost transparent text.  then you need to press touchpad to go to 'ALL' tab (which displays s***) and then you have to switch to 'Mission Overview' to see current available mission.  i never seen any game develop quest tracking this lousy epic fail.

5>on the UI, alot of text are displayed:
  -small text
  -almost transparent white color text
  -almost transparent background text

so that small transparent text sorta blend with background environment to make it difficult to read.  you have witcher 3 small text epic fail.  the division kick up thousand notch.  unbelievable epic fail.

6>out in open world, i don't see other player like destiny.  so this is not mmo.  this is just open world by myself?

7>also, i cant just go to open world to level up, because there is no mob in open world.  the only way to level up is i do the quest that is given to me.  so if i am level 2 and quest given to me is levl 4, then i am screwed.  there is no other way for me to level up.  who design this epic fail?

ubisoft need to fire that UI designer, product manager, or QA for passing this garbage.  these hurts gameplay two words, epic fail."

It boggles the mind how Sega refused to even remotely worry about the people actually playing this piece of garbage. Sure, the graphics are the most superb I've ever witnessed. But the inability to control your fielders is NOT a good thing. Add that to the fact that your fielders also seem to be playing for your opponents,(I'm sorry, but you just do not wait until a line drive is right next to you before deciding to move after it.) and you've got the worst game ever. Not the worst sports game, the worst GAME EVER. PERIOD. I WOULDN'T MAKE MY WORST ENEMY PLAY THIS.

1.0	Because of what I consider to be a significant flaw, this is a somewhat superficial review of Armored Core2. Armored Core 2 has great graphics and even, nicely designed missions, although it often requires you to repeat completly unnecessary dialogs and setup sequences even for repeat attempts that only serve to waste time. Aside from that though, it has what to me is a major and disqualifying flaw. The PS2 has really great analog controls. Armored Core 2 doesnt use them. They say they use analog control, but they only use the 2 analog sticks as single push buttons. How can you build a cutting edge mech fighter and not bother to incorporate one of the most significant features of the PS2. This would be bad enough on its own, but the manual controls are extremely slow and ponderous. If something is shooting at you from behind, you can pretty well count on the fact that by the time you can get these hulking beasts turned around you are going to be toast or at least severely damaged. They also accelerate and decelerate with equal lack of alacrity. I might add, that the AI mechs that are attacking you actually appear to have higher performance than you can acheive in your own mech. It is a terrible shame that an otherwise really great game is so severely flawed by such inadequate control. The design it yourself mech feature is really excellent, and if it weren't for the truly hobbling nature of the controls, this really would be a 5 star game. You will find my copy for sale online real soon now. Clunky interface
1.0	"Spore comes DRM that does not allow you to install it more than 3 times. If you need to for whatever reason, you'll have to call up EA and beg them to make an exception for you.

That's right. You will need to call during regular business hours, sit on hold, and then beg to have them allow you to play the game you paid for - and they might or might not do it.

Spend your money on a game that you can install and play again and again and again, a game that isn't bundled with draconian DRM that solves nothing (this game was pirated before release and the pirated version can be installed with no limits).

I suggest: GalCiv or Sins of a Solar Empire. That's a lot of money for a game rental"
1.0	"What a piece of junk. I have a Logitech Precision controller that played PERFECTLY with Lego Star Wars 2. All i had to do is click on it once, and it worked by default. No problem, no maintenance. But not on Indy. Turns out you can't use your controller unless you ""map"" it onto ALL the possible controls MANUALLY. Come to find out, I run out of buttons on my controller to assign to functions in the game. And so it won't let me ""accept"" my settings because i have 2 empty slots. I read on some forums that you can assign those useless slots to the keyboard. I tried, you can't. So i can't play the game with a controller. I have to use keyboard. That's stupid. LucasArts, you guys suck. Thankfully I was smart enough to not purchase the game and feel ripped off, i used the demo. LucasArts, you did not and WILL not take my money. I strongly recommend that anyone thinking about buying, play the demo and see if you can use your controller. Thinking about buying? Read this FIRST (controller can't ""map"" to game)"

1.0	"Yet another game released full of bugs that stop you from enjoying your purchase.

Do you like to game in 5.1 surround sound? Too bad! Somehow they managed to break the sound so that in surround mode, ALL sounds are coming from directly on top of you. Good luck picking out speech or audio clues. The solution given thus far? Play in 2.1, surround doesn't work.

Would you like to play with 2.1 sound? Good luck! Roll the dice and see if you get the sounds necessary to play the game. I didn't. All I can hear is the constantly blowing Mars wind.

Some random people report being able to start the game in 2.1 mode, and then later switch to 5.1 or 7.1 (or 4.1) and play normally, but it doesn't work for a lot of people.

Wait until they put out a couple of patches (IF they do) before purchasing this game. It seems like it would be fun. Too bad.

Dec 22nd, 2009 - More than 3 months after the game was released, they finally patched it. The following patch notes are from the game's official forums:

Fixes:

  * 5.1 Surround Sound was not working properly for some users.
  * Several crashes for users running ATI cards have been fixed (most often when accessing Display Options in game)
  * Performance improved on ATI cards
  * Cursor Sensitivity for 360 controller has been tweaked. Before, moving diagonal and vertical adjustments moved at different speeds. They now move at equal speeds.
  * Turret Sensitivity has been adjusted to work without having to drop the base value.
  * MP Playlists will be updated to include all maps and modify certain options. Currently, a few maps are only available through Custom Matches.
  * Some overlapping text and icons have been fixed.
  * (9/30) Modding will be disabled in online matchmaking games with this patch. It will still be available in LAN games, though no XP will be awarded there.

So I finally got to spend a couple of hours today playing a game I purchased over 3 months ago. I'm not terribly impressed. The game is Grand Theft Auto Destroy Everything, which in theory sounds fun, but the implementation is dismal. Vehicle control with an XBox 360 controller or keyboard/mouse is extremely inaccurate. Driving in general feels like a chore. Blowing stuff up is fun, but the missions range from ridiculously easy to next to impossible. The last mission in the first area was designed by a full blown moron. Up to 30 enemy trucks drive around the screen, smashing into each other at random in an attempt to stop you from completing the mission. With so many enemies, and the complete lack of control you have over your vehicle, it is next to impossible to complete the mission. Only trying over and over and finally getting lucky one time did I complete this mission, ON EASY!

I'd suggest that if you really must try this game, buy it used from somebody for less than $15. PC version - full of bugs"

1.0	"I feel I should post how much I hated this piece of junk here, since the other reviews seem to give the impression that it's a fantastic game and everybody will love it. I couldn't stand it and took it back a couple of days later. All the positive reviews below positively puzzle me, since engaged in a conversation about this game in the local EB, everybody else declared they had hated it too. So who's writing those reviews?

The thing is too slow! It takes about 50 years to build a school. And the economics of the game don't make sense either -- you charge nothing for rent and pay everybody beaucoup bucks, and still everybody moves off your island and the birth rate decreases.

Also, this game is not as funny as the programmers obviously believe. I agree with the reviewer below who said that the manual is much funnier than the actual game.

Lastly, the graphics of the game are overcomplex, meaning that the game will be extremely fussy on most setups. This wouldn't be such a problem, but Tropico either has no tech support line, or they don't answer what they say is the support line, or they've done a fantastic job with hiding the contact information of the real tech support line. In other words, after a couple of days of trying, I couldn't get any help. avoid this"
1.0	I bought 2. I was hoping I could play the new games I just bought. Plugged one in and the controller wouldn't move properly. When I pushed down, Link would go right. When I pushed right, Link would go up. I kept freaking dying. Very frustrating. So I plugged in the second one. More of the same thing. I called Amazon. They said that that's what happens with these controllers over time. I told them, I just bought it last week. So they refunded my money so I could buy an authentic NES controller. Glad I did. Totally sucks
1.0	It's really sad on how they can combine two of Marvel's greatest super heroes and make a horrible game out of it and its no surprise that its been created by LJN.  I really wished that Nintendo could've licensed someone else to make this crossover because LJN is known for screwing up so many games for the NES, especially from famous movies and comic book heroes.  The cover of the game cartridge, title screen, and the fact that its Spider-Man and the X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, and Gambit) working together on one game misleaded every child into thinking how exciting the game would be, until they start the first level of the game.  The graphics weren't the worst, but the game looks like it belong to the NES or Sega Master System so there was no excuse on that department.  The gameplay totally sucks you know what.  Attacks are not very responsive and the game itself is unfairly difficult (remember that there are no continues in this game).  I love fun challenges, but this game went beyond impossible (this game is for kids so why is it so hard?).  I rented this game a few times back in 1993 and I was annoyed each time (I never finished the first level for each hero in Murder World level) so that is one of the video game memories I wish not to relive.  Like Spider-Man and The Sinister Six and NES version of The Uncanny X-Men, this is one Marvel Comic licensed game not worth playing and I can't believe that someone on Amazon is selling it for such a high price (no self respecting gamer would even buy this crap for a penny).  Please stay away from this horrible game. Great Marvel crossover turns into another crappy game!
1.0	"EA for whatever reason blocks players from showing up in ""players met"", and refuses to add a rematch option at the end of a fight even though it was standard for all the THQ games. This means if you want a rematch you have to write down your opponents name, enter it manually, and hope they accept and haven't already started another fight. 99% of the time that's too much effort for anyone to bother. Rematches are what makes quick matches fun, because you can play around the first time, then play serious if you lose.

As far as gameplay, it's not much of an improvement. The striking is ok, the grappling is weird and you constantly get frozen in positions for a short time which just makes everything look awkward. Apparently nobody knows how to throw anything but slow motion hammer fists on the ground.

EA also still hasn't figured out what a knock out is or when a fight should be stopped. You can literally fold someone in half against the cage, as their lifeless body just kind of slides to the ground. Then they will miraculously come back to life, all while the ref looks on doing nothing. Honestly you have absolutely no idea when you knock someone down whether they are out cold, hardly hurt, or badly stunned. You mostly have to just wait and see if they reanimate, or listen to Rogans comments for clues. WTF EA. If a fighter is knocked limp and lifeless, the fight is over. How it takes more than 2 games to figure this out is beyond me, although this IS the company that originally said mma isn't even a sport, so whatever EA.

1.0	If you like getting nerfed every week or two and having to spend more money on equipment just so you don't suck after the nerf, this is the game for you. Seriously, this game was soo fun at first and I didn't mind the first few nerfs at all. But the most recent nerf basically took off 60%+ increased attack speed off every item in the game, except quivers. Which basically took off 1/3 of my damage per second. Blizzard sold out and doesn't care about it's player base. They nerf knowing a lot of the players will hate it, yet they do it anyway. This was a great game that turned TERRIBLE from terrible management. A lot of players are already quitting the game, just check the forums. Once you find a good build to work with, they'll nerf that also and make you buy a whole new set of equipment from the Real Money Auction House just to keep up with the game. This is not worth your money, if you haven't bought it yet. This game is seriously the most unprepared game I've ever experienced. I've never seen so many DRASTIC nerfs in so little time and it's seriously really frustrating. They should've done these nerfs during beta testing and not when it was released.  This game is rigged just to take all your money. If this game didn't have the name Diablo in it, it wouldnt have sold as many copies as it did. The most disappointing game I ever played.

There is a reason why an extended warranty is not offered on these (they have a 90-day limited warranty), it's because the quality of its construction is absolute garbage.  Do yourselves a favor and save $50 and pick up an SA928 (quality construction). GARBAGE!  HEADSET BREAKS ABOVE EAR PIECE WITHOUT FAIL IN 4 MONTHS!
1.0	"I didn't play the online component of this game, so take that into consideration when reading this.

I expected to at least like this game because I loved NBA 2k11, which was the last one I played. Because I have issues, I hate-played NBA 2K16 much longer than I should've in hopes that I could grind and upgrade the player I created into a hoop god that could overcome all of the cheap tactics the game employs. Unfortunately, NBA 2K16 was having none of that.

I think the most important thing to know about this game is that it's meant to be played with humans controlling all of the players. Controlling only one player such as in the My Player mode is a frustrating experience, because your computer controlled teammates will constantly let you down. Playing against the computer will test your patience because it does many things that are simply unfair and unrealistic.

Some computer misbehavior I observed over 200 games played:

 - I never once saw the computer miss a runner, contested or not, which is absurd. The programmers think that runners and layups are equally difficult.
 - The only way to get the computer to miss a layup is to cleanly block the shot or foul. Contesting without blocking or fouling means a made layup every single time.
 - My teammates never got one offensive rebound off a missed free throw. It just doesn't happen unless you do it yourself.
 - DeAndre Jordan never missed both free throws. He's a career 43% shooter at the stripe.
 - For some reason, Emmanuel Mudiay and Elfrid Payton were really good. You might be saying who? That's my point.
 - Computer defensive opponents routinely put their hands up and blocked my passes when they weren't even looking anywhere in my direction. Awesome!
 - The computer got to 99% of loose balls before I did. After a while, I figured out that the game is programmed to give computer opponents a boost in speed and reaction time in loose ball situations. Thanks 2K!

My breaking point with this game was after I grinded through several full seasons to get the skill that's supposed to make your created player a great finisher at the rim. After equipping this skill, my 6' 9"" point guard proceeded to continue missing softly contested layups with the same frequency as before. In reaction to the last miss, which was of course in crunch time, I promptly ejected the disc from my PS3 and unsuccessfully attempted to snap it in half. I had to settle for rage-folding it in half a couple of times and throwing it in the trash.

I really hate this game. Owned it for 3 months, then threw it in the garbage"

1.0	Not recommended, it's a lot different than the POKEMON alpha sapphire.... One Star
1.0	Wii does not work:-( One Star
1.0	no comment. One Star
1.0	I downloaded this game and wished I never had. The controls and interface are so backwards and strange and difficult to get used to that it will probably take you about 30 minutes just to figure out what in the hell you have to do. I downloaded this game for free and felt like I got ripped off. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. It's atrociously bad and the programmers of this game should probably quit making games. Not even worth only $1
1.0	Be advised, this game should not be part of your collection under any circumstances or at any cost. It's terrible in a word. You can't use controllers to control the bikes and the keyboard controls are not much better either. The graphics are dated. I uninstalled after 10 minutes of gameplay. Save your money and skip this one for pete's sake. What a joke!
1.0	Why can other games connect well and perform without lag but activision is still behind the times? So many multiplayer issues for a ga,e and company that grosses so much money. This has clearly become about profit over performance and they just don't care about the end product or the users experience. Why can other games connect well and perform without lag ...
1.0	Bad game all and all One Star
1.0	"The Star rating above for ""fun"" above should read ZERO stars. Sorry. My bad.

I never write reviews for products I have never even tried--unless something that is relevant to other potential buyers prevents me from trying or owning it, in which case a review is necessary to inform potential buyers. That is the case with Red Alert 3, where the Draconian copy protection issue has indeed prevented me from purchasing a game that I had looked forward to owning with nothing but joyful anticipation for a long, long time--until the day it was released, and EA Games insulted my dignity.

In a world where so many people are quick to give up their dignity in favor of ""security"", ""comfort"", and in this case, the ability to play a video game, I have no choice but to boycott Red Alert 3 and all other EA Games products.

The executives at EA games have never met me. Why then do they assume that I go to work each day to earn money, spend a large sum of that money on one of their video games, and then GIVE what I just paid for away to thousands of people whom I've never even met on the internet? For that matter, why do they assume that I would ever know HOW to do something like this, if I wanted to? This is an insult to my dignity, and an overestimation of my technical skills, for no good reason.

Furthermore, calling those lawbreakers who DO copy software ""pirates"" is a profound insult to every victim of real PIRATES throughout history--people who have been disfigured, raped, murdered, and sold into slavery. I'm sorry, but calling a paying customer a potential ""pirate"" is far more of an injury to me, than enduring the ""suffering"" of never owning a game that I otherwise would have gladly purchased at full price.

Let your own conscience be your own guide. But make no mistake about it--the DRM issue with Red Alert 3 IS relevant, and it IS grounds for boycotting all EA Games products. Not only has EA Games totally ruined this gaming experience for me, but they have even corrupted my memory of fun and comradery that I enjoyed playing previous versions of Command & Conquer with my friends over the years. EA Game executives have taken so very much away from us. Why then would anyone who possesses even a shred of self-worth even consider purchasing another one of their products?

I give this product 0 stars, because the manufacturer has created conditions that provide zero pleasure from this product. Losing Your Dignity is NOT Fun"
1.0	"I usually don't have anything bad to say about Nintendo as they're the best in the gaming industry. This however, is unacceptable, & I can't support this kind of under handed move.

First off, If you plan on hacking you're Wii, like me, don't buy this package. It's a black Wii so it's not 100% brick proof. What you're gonna want is the first model, the white 2006 model, not to be confused with the white 2010/2011 model. If you've never thought about hacking your Wii, you may want to look into it. A hacked Wii is about the most powerful and flexible gaming system I've ever seen. When it's hacked, it's abilities make it blow the PS3/360 completely out of the water. Also, don't think I'm encouraging anything illegal. There IS such a thing as a legal way to hack, and I for one own a white Wii which is hacked, and a black Wii from the Mario Kart Bundle which isn't hacked, so yes I still buy ALL my games legally.

Now for the part that REALLY upsets me. After all these years of the Wii being known to have GameCube controller ports and GameCube memory cards slots, how can you POSSIBLY release a Wii that has NEITHER, and NOT tell your consumers? This has been a very manipulative move on Nintendo's part, taking advantage of the trust of their customers, purposefully. It's advertised like any other Wii, and looks exactly like the Wii from the Mario Kart Bundle, when it's not, it's completely different. So if you had a Wii before and played all your old Gamecube games but then something went wrong causing you to need a new one, you'd walk into a store or order this, only to find out after getting home that you've just wasted time AND money. What's even worse is that in an attempt to rid themselves of their own guilty conscience, AND try to soften you up a bit after knowing you're gonna be completely angry with this deal, they slide in a stupid copy of New Super Mario Bros Wii, as if that could make up for you being totally ripped off! I've always defended Nintendo when it came to putting their customers first so this is a shocking disappointment to me and everyone else who ever has! It's time to shape up Nintendo! This behaviour is unbecoming of you! If You're A Hacker, Interested In Hacking, Or Just Wanna Play GameCube Games, Stay Away."
1.0	This game is very difficult to control and it is extremely boring. It may have been a great game six years ago, but by today's standards this one is a definite loser. Save your money. Insanely Boring

they are not fun , they are not games , so why ask me to rate these items as such.
anyway yes these are great GBA cases . this is a silly thing to review"
1.0	Anything more than $12.99 is way over priced. Nintendo needs to get their act together and sell these properly. Anything more than $12.99 is over priced. Not worth it.
1.0	this game drops you into a town with no idea how to proceed in the story or any tutorial at all except on how to run your shop. In this game you can do nothing but run your shop look in the woods for random items and hope you trigger an event out of luck. the town is over expansive and dull with characters you won't care about or connect with. It may be made by the makers of Harvest Moon but unlike those games its horrible. If you do buy this game make sure to buy the physical copy so you can return it if you don't like it. A very boring game
1.0	"I'll not regurgitate what has already been gleaned from prior reviewers but, spend your money on something other than this one folks: this brand has been milked so far past it's shelf life that not even the addition of the womens national teams can save it.

This game's control (or lack thereof) managed to take me to the brink of smashing my controller on multiple occasions since purchase, simply put this game is hot garbage juice folks. If you want poor (read:none existent) online matchmaking, frustrating (read: crappy) controls, microtransactions galore, unbalanced gameplay (read: pay to win) and to be outmatched and outpaced by the game's AI on every counter attack you make, then by all means, this is your cup of tea; but if you're looking for decent value and entertainment for your money then seek life elsewhere.

On a side note: I've since started playing Pro Evolution Soccer again to fill the football void left by this abysmal game...and it's surprisingly so much better!! Everything from the player models and movements on the field is leagues better than EA's FIFA 16. Even the commentary is better...ok perhaps not but honestly, I don't think that I'll be buying another FIFA title for a long while Wholesome controller smashing fun!!"
1.0	"It shipped fast which was good I guess. It would download onto Windows Vista and Windows 8...but when I tried opening it, it said ""please get administrators permission and try again"" it did this for both computers. I called tech support and they hung up after a little bit. So a bad review for both the game itself and tech support. Now it's too late to send back to Amazon so I'll have to make a trade in to game stop. Very disappointed. if I could give this no stars I would..."
1.0	I think it's impossible to control these cars with a controller. Perhaps a $120 steering wheel might help, but who wants to spend that kind of money. This is the last racing game I'll ever buy, a waste of money and my time. Impossible to control!!!
1.0	Hated it  constantly fighting the controls and it wass just terrible all in all, will never buy an old tomb raider again!! Never!!
1.0	Hello,Don't get duped! This game no longer supports the PC Xbox controller! If I wanted to run the keys on my key board I'd have typed a letter. If I wanted mediocre graphics I'd buy an Xbox. PC gamers beware there is no support for your controller
1.0	Came in horrible condition, fortunately needed the bios only. Not as described tho. One Star
1.0	This controller has to be one of the worst out on the market.  It has a horrible design, is made of cheap plastic, and to make matters worse, it's  also highly priced.  Don't even think about using it for games like Marvel  Vs. Capcom, because even casual play will break this controller.  If you're  serious about games, find an import controller made by another company.  Don't even bother with the other Dreamcast controllers out in America, they  are all just as bad, if not worse. What was Sega Thinking?
1.0	Couldn't get this to work for the life of me! One Star
1.0	The screen glitches a lot! I have to turn it off and on to get it to work.  The velcro is a pain in the ass to put back in if you pull it out.  Only thing great about this is that it is portable.  I would've returned this already, if I wasn't deployed right now and in need of something portable as I am always moving every week.  The cost is too much for a TV screen that glitches every now and then.  The case does it job of protecting the TV I guess...  I feel like I should've just bought a brief case with pads and put a TV inside for transportation. Only thing great about this is that it is portable
1.0	"Get the travel case, instead, it really doesn't protect it that much, althoug it is confy for handling, more confy than the travel case.

I'd get it if I don't really take the PSP out of my house, because I don't feel it protects it from a fall or rough handling. Nah!"
1.0	Got the game... it was in great condition,  but when I tried to load it.  It would not start.  I read online.. saw that many people had the same problem.  Tried everything that was suggested online, up to but not including reformatting my hard drive.  :)  The game looks fun,  good plot, but if you cannot get it to run, it is like getting a great book in Sanskrit.  No good if you can't experience it.  So, fair warning.... Could not get to run on Windows 8
1.0	"Today I have read about no less than three games (including this one) that have such stupid copy protection schemes that I will not buy the game.  Way to go!  You have lost another customer.

At some point the STEAM, starforce, dvd-rw hating game companies are going to figure out why there sales keep slipping.

Too bad...I'm off to find a game that doesn't compromise my computer. Wow, another game looses a potential buyer"
1.0	Sadly, this much anticipated game contains the SecuROM virus. The so called copy protection scheme (which will probably be cracked by pirates sometime this afternoon) does nothing to prevent piracy and everything to infringe upon your right of first sale. SecuROM dictates what programs you can have installed on your computer, has been known do disable virtual drives and cannot be removed through any conventional means. If you are interested in being punished for a crime you didn't commit, by all means send Rockstar your money. Mine is staying right here in my wallet. To bad, I really wanted this game. I guess I'll just have to watch youtube videos of you guys playing it. virus alert
1.0	"this came as a free ""bonus"" with GHWT - and that's about all it's worth - keep as a temporary spare in case the original controller dies - it works OK, but the design and playability are seriously lacking only if free"
1.0	"More like a GT Lite game. But costing $70, of course. Missing hundreds of cars and tracks that have been on every other GT release. Doe not have any Career mode. Its whole reason for being is online racing.

But I don't ever race online. Its a group or family activity, racing side by side. Thats exciting. Sitting alone in a room racing, Thats depressing. Take a look at what all the questions ask for before a game comes out  split screen local racing. .

I used to buy 40 racing games a year. Now I buy one every 4 years. This one, GTSport. And an expensive G29 wheel which only runs with this game for 2 player and one other game. AND THIS IS AFTER 4 YEARS OF PS4!

Dont care anymore. Stupid developers are getting what they deserve right now. Low sales, closings. Matbe you should have listented to the people that bought your games.

1.0	"We agonized over our decision to purchase a new game console this Christmas.  We decided on the PS4.  Huge mistake.  The SONY network, which is integral to this product, has been down since Christmas eve and all SONY has had to say on the topic is the same zero-meaning blather they use to respond to tech support queries.  The latest status?  SONY reports the network is up. It is not.  A lot of people might be sympathetic to Sony given that this was a hack, but if SONY remains vulnerable to a simple denial of service attack it is entirely SONY's fault.  If a simple DOS attack results in days and days of service loss, it is SONY's fault.  SONY has not invested enough in network security, or their security team is entirely incompetent.  SONY wants us to pay subscription fees to use their network.  I am frankly NOT convinced that my credit card info would be safe in their hands, nor am I convinced that SONY is doing anything at all to fix this situation or harden their systems against intrusion and denial of service.  That said, I'm also dealing with some seriously disappointed kids whose Christmas has been very disappointing.  I don't care how pretty the games are- SONY fails at step one: ""Make it work.""  This is a hunk of garbage.  This is a symbol of the cost-cutting and marketeering that provides maximum profit to fat cats while providing minimum service to customers.  Movie stars, be furious that your information was leaked, it is SONY's fault.  Their network is an open target for even the least talented of hackers because SONY does not care about it. SONY's ongoing disregard for network security makes huge December headlines."

1.0	"I got this for my son's 8th birthday.  He was very excited.  Then we tried to sync it up.

They say to have more than 4 feet of room - I was doing this in my great room which has much more than that free all around, it's where we play the kinect as well.  So space isn't the issue.

They say to use old batteries - so I pulled out my multimeter, found the lowest rechargeable AA batteries I had that would still power the unit.  No joy.

They say turn off lights and close the curtains, get the room darker.  No luck.

They say turn off the TV during the calibration so there's no interference.  No difference.

In about 45 minutes of holding in all the curse words I didn't want to say in front of my increasingly saddened birthday boy, I finally managed to get it to do the calibration.  And then I though I was home free.  Until the voiceover tells you about the next step in calibration, which is stepping on the back of the board to tilt it up.  That failed, because it said I wasn't covering the sensor enough.  That was not the problem though, since at one point I was so frustrated with it, that I put duct tape over the back sensor and tilted it.  Still I was told the back sensor wasn't covered.  And it wasn't backwards, since they're so clear about the buttons being on the left side of the board...

So this one got tossed aside.  Not even worth returning, since I got it on a gold box deal for under ten bucks.  I'll play around some other time to see if I can ever get it past the calibration, to hopefully surprise my son, but today the birthday boy has written it off as the sad part of opening his presents, something he won't get to play with. Never got past calibration"
1.0	"This game uses the same horrible DRM scheme that is found on Bioshock, Mass Effect, Crysis Warhead, Spore, Dead Space, Sacred 2, and Red Alert 3. I refuse to purchase a game that requires me to ask permission to install the game. There are several games that I own that I have had to install more than five times for various reasons. That is why I refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times I can install the game, let alone a DRM program (like SecuRom) that could be considered a trojen horse.

As a side note, this DRM method does nothing to stop piracy. All of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some, like spore, even before their release (with the exceptions of Sacred 2 and Red Alert 3 which have not been released yet, however the developers confirmed that they would use the SecuRom activation DRM scheme). The only thing this DRM does do is prevent this game from entering the used game market. Horrible DRM Kills The Game"
1.0	Blah. Got this to use with Raspberry Pi 2. Recognized all the buttons except the joystick. Never tried on a computer so this review is only directed to somebody needing it for the Raspberry Pi. Doesn't recognize N64 joystick on the Raspberry Pi.

1.0	Buggy junk pass it by Buggy junk
1.0	I returned this product because it sucked!!! The steering was impossible and it did not work with every racing game. I thought it made the need for speed game harder to play. More than all of that this controller has a cord....UGH can we say wireless controls in 2011. not what I expected
1.0	I got this in a wii bundle. I only like the tennis game. I suggest wii sport resort if anything boring not worth playing
1.0	"I had really hoped for more from this game.  Sadly it's more or less Civ 5 in new clothes with most of Civ 5's best features lost in the translation.  Same as many others I've waited years for them to ""finish"" civ 5 and thought this would be a good culmination of their work.  Wrong!  This is more like starting over with a big step backwards.

I regret giving them my 50 bucks for this, it should have been downloadable content for civ 5.  At least then some of the polish they'd achieved would have been carried over.

UPDATE:  Minus another star, was 3 now 2.  I've played several games of this new civ so far, they go much faster than usual.  There are some neat things and now that I've got used to the interface it's ok too.  What isn't ok is having to play on only random maps.  No scenarios, no meticulously setting up the perfect game.  And I'm sorry to say, random gets boring and repetitive very fast.

Hopefully soon they will release a map and scenario editor and given things like that have, for a very long time, been a part of Sid Meier's Civilization, it's pretty lame they release this game without it.  IMHO.

2nd UPDATE:  It's been a month now and still no update so there goes another star.

On a positive note, the game does play nicely.  It moves along with an ease I've not before noticed in any civ and the soft sounds for events don't make me cringe. Overpriced and Uninspired"
1.0	worse game ever for online game play  .do not waste your time on this horrible game shooter

  Senate missions consist of blockading one port after another very exhilirating. NOT. People get added to your retinue and they all have their special talents and points.  Where is my calculator so I can figure out what good they are to me with whatever leader they belong to, if indeed they serve that leader any good and if not I can move them to another leader or general if it works over there. Ooops didn't work lets see, if I take Procrasis the diplomat from General Falucha and give him to General blah blah blah.

  There is no sense of accomplishement other then winning ground and lets face it, all the fighting in the end amounts to a chaotic mad rush and fight to see who kills more. You really do need multiplayer to handle seige engines by one person and the dogs by another and the chariots and archers etc etc cause as a single player it aint gonna work so just end up piling all your troops on top of the other and usually if your numbers are greater you will win everytime. Stupid AI

This reminds me of all the hype of Tresspasser Jurassic Park, and how it would be non scripted and you could go everywhere and really feel immersed in that Island B world

  Well in the end the game was interesting for its concepts but scripted and dull, but if you went over to some fan forums it seemed like the game couldn't do no wrong and who the hell was anybody else to say otherwise.

So the people who give it 5 stars kinda puzzle me. Cant return the game so it has to be 5 stars? Cant admit that its not the end all and be all of the TW series so its gotta be good and the rest of us don't know how to play or our computer sucks, yada yada?

-1 star-gameplay-This game was SOOOOOOOOO poorly made. In the easiest difficulty i lost 8-5. With the same teams in 2 harder difficulties, i won 35-0!!Also, u ALWAYS get away with stealing from first to second, but u NEVER be safe stealing from second to third.
-1 star- This game gets boring sOO eaily becuase it only has 2 good modes. There is practice, and exibition which is the same. Home run derby WHICH IS TERRIBLE BECUASE U CANT FACE THE COMPUTER!, and a season which is terrible because half way through the season u always get a roster problom which is impossible to fix.
-1 star-Crashes easily and takes 25 minutes to instal- this game which is about 300 meg took 25 minutes to install on my SUPER good 1.2 ghz amd athelon pc. Diablo 2 which is 1 gig, 3 TIMES THE AMOUNT!, took 3 minutes to install. Also, when u play this and u forget to close ur instant messeges, and u get an instant messege, the game minimizes. ONCE IT MINIMIZES, SAY GOOD BYE!! cuase once u click on the game to bring it back the screen turns black and it freezes.
Do not buy this game! DONT buy this thing"
1.0	"Product looks and appears good quality.

Installation was pretty straight forward.

However immediately after installation, the aftermarket wiring harness provided to support the 'nitro button' feature caused an overload in the voltage regulator and quite literally burned a hole in the transistor.

At this point, the nitro button turns on the fans, however when disabled causes the fans to shut off entirely and will overheat the console with continued use.

I contacted amazon for support and they replied to me saying that they only fulfilled the order through another seller and if I want to return the ""unopened or original condition game"" I could do so. First off, it's not a damn game - it's a hardware upgrade accessory.

Second - The problem is, since it burned out the voltage regulator on the xbox motherboard, without the wiring harness included with the fans, the xbox console would no longer work at all.

So I can't return the fans, I can't use the xbox without the fans, and it's who knows if that wiring harness will fail or overload the motherboard again in the future - possibly causing a total system failure.

Congratulations guys, your 'whisper legacy' fan has now made my xbox console louder than a commercial jet. It isn't a GAME"
1.0	"First I'll start by saying I have used this controller extensively on Halo 4 for now over a year and feel that I am qualified to post my review. Let me start off with a list of current Razer products I have bought and used to show my experience with the company and to produce some credibility.

Razer Naga wired MMO mouse
Razer Orochi mouse
Razer SWTOR mouse
Razer Lycosa keyboard (I own 2 of these)
Razer SWTOR headset
Razer Carcharias headset
Razer SWTOR mouse pad
Razer Kabuto mouse pad

So as you can see I have spent a lot of money and also purchased these items directly from Razer on their Amazon store or at Best Buy.  That being said after using these products for the past two years or so I want to warn people of their customer service and general lack of build quality. For example my Lycosa keyboards have to be unplugged about once every day because at some point during use the keyboard will input one key infinitely until unplugged.  I dealt with customer service and did all the troubleshooting and to this day the problem still hasn't been resolved. Just imagine being in a PVP battle only to have your keyboard only output the A button and leave your character spinning in circles. Would say in the past year this type of incident has occurred at least 100 times. Including in Microsoft Office and general internet use.

The next issue I experienced was with the Carcharias headset. I purchased the product to use on 360 but accidentally ordered the item only compatible with PC. Again talked to customer service the day the package was received and they charged me a shipping and restocking fee. My fault on this one but still after spending an absurd amount of money on their products I continue to be treated poorly.

Last is this Sabertooth controller which is the last straw and marks the last time I buy a Razer product. I purchased this product on February 2nd, 2013 and noticed around January of 2014 that the LB (left bumper button is becoming less responsive) wasn't performing as intended.  An example is sometimes it wouldn't register when clicked distally on the button.  If clicked on the proximal side the button worked as intended.  Now the button only responds when pressed on the side close to the M1 button which is uncomfortable and difficult to reach.  Also as a bumper jumper Halo player the LB button is quite important and now find the controller virtually worthless.  Their response to this was for me to click the button in the location that produces a response.

Really? With the design of this controller being for competitive gaming reaching the left and right bumpers most proximal side is horribly uncomfortable and definitely puts you at a disadvantage. I then e-mailed again asking if there is a repair option or a way to fix the problem to which their response was

""We are very sorry but please be informed that usually we do not repair our products.

Also we are unable to provide a replacement for your product, as it is no longer under warranty. Please see http://www.razerzone.com/warranty for our complete warranty terms, lengths and conditions.

Sorry again for any inconvenience.""

Usually? But not in my case apparently even though I have now spent a combined 790$ in Razer products over 3 years mostly from their Amazon store with some purchases made at my local Best Buy. So Razer's response is, as i read it,  well you got accustomed to our controller which has a significantly different button layout and now that it doesn't work we don't care about you as a consumer. I honestly couldn't be more disappointed.

So after my customer service stories I will give my review of the controller. The rockers which are really the main selling point of this controller are a very good idea and work as intended.  When I first used them it didn't take long before they became second nature and I stopped using the face buttons. I'm hoping that Razer doesn't have a patent on this design so maybe a company with better build quality would apply this to their controllers, but I'm guessing Razer will patent this idea.  They worked wonderfully at first but become loose after significant use (somewhere around 100 hours if I had to guess).  The screwdriver shipped with the controller will tighten them but I've noticed over time they never return to their original feel and are wobbly to the touch.

The face buttons are a hyper responsive button that requires minimal pressure to use but when you have the rockers they become worthless honestly. The controller also has a nice rubber feel and fits nicely in my hands. Other than the rockers I'd say the controller is pretty standard.  I use Kontrol Freeks on both joysticks so I don't have much experience with the sticks but they felt up to the Microsoft build quality.

The rockers are a really nice feature but Razer's customer service and build quality leave much to be desired.  I'd say before buying this controller at least check out some other options for competitive controllers that at least allow for repairs. Or you might have spent 80 dollars on a controller that won't last longer than a year.

So all in all I thought the rockers were a great idea but do realize you might buy something that is going to work for a year and be offered zero support from Razer customer service. Rockers are a great idea, but Razer's customer service and build quality ruin the experience."

1.0	This game is quite simply a joke so was last years game for that matter. And yes I have played both games. Although I didn't play much more than five games a piece between both of them because they are that bad. Whatever happened to being able to hit the ball ? Whatever happened to being able to pitch the ball with a couple buttons and using the analog stick to use movement ? The idea of using the analog stick to pitch that pitch isn't that bad but it just isn't as fun as the developers anticipate it being. The last really good baseball game was for the original xbox and it was MVP. Yes I said that ! MLB THE SHOW is way bettter than this too but Iam not going to buy a playstation just to get a baseball game no no. I will continue to neglect any sports game that xbox has to offer or any system for that matter. Sports games are like the economy they use to be good but they have all gone down the toilet. HORRIFIC
1.0	"This game usb awful, its a derpy megaman clone with bad level design, cheap bosses, boring story and gameplay. No wall jump or charge shot, basically you have to dash into enemies to hurt them after you weaken them first.
Some levels are harder then the bosses due to how bad they are, no hints to explain how certain things work. Dont buy this game unless you want to waste money on broken games Its megaman but bad lol"
1.0	I thought this was a normal side scroller game and unless they hid one on here I only found mini games that sucked terribly?? tortuously so ..worst game ..ever. I liked the playstation one although am so stuck on it on one of first levels but that's me with most games alas..great graphics and great normal side scrolling..i liked the Gameboy ones as well all great compared to this odd one..least to me the little I checked it out and got frustrated by its hard to figure out ness worst unless like just mini games and no side scrolling game?
1.0	I bought this on a flash sale for cheap. Game didn't work after following Amazon Downloading instructions. I don't think it's my computer, I have high performance gaming desktop that I built: i7 4770k, GTX 780 Ti, 16GB Ram, and SSD. I didn't bother with asking Amazon for a refund, I'll just wait and see if it goes on sell one day on Steam. I bought this on a flash sale for cheap. ...
1.0	well it worked for a little bit, but as others have said after about a week or two, it started making really REALLY horrible and noticeable grinding noises. Would not recommend this product till they fix the issues with it. (that is IF they fix them) hm...
1.0	"This game's controls are some of the most sluggish and clunkiest that I've ever had the displeasure of having to deal with. The gameplay is slow, boring, repetitive and unrewarding. Does putting up with this sorry excuse for gameplay get you anything? No, you get almost no content for your buck. This game offers nothing worthwhile. Just a couple barebone modes with one being a ""Story"" that's just a few lazily hashed together still dialogue sequences with asinine reasons as to why they must fight, all done with no personality or any humor. This is the sorriest excuse for a game that has a $50 CE option(which I foolishly bought on name alone).

Now you might ask: Are the CE items at least worth it? Meh, not really, no. Spare yourself clunky gameplay and zero content"

1.0	Like all Samurai/ Dynasty Warrior games I wasn't expecting anything less than brainless fun. The only good thing about this game is using the Wii controller and nunchuck to hack and slash your way through. The graphics are horrible by today's standard, and there is no freedom to roam around in the game. It's set up like an old arcade shoot em up, which does not work well with this game. Pass this game up. And don't even think twice about renting it. Another crappy game for the Wii

1.0	This is one for the gaming history books. This is one of the worst games ever made.  When I bought this game a few years ago, I was so excited seeing that I have played Lords of the Realm II since about 1997 and is such a super great game.  When I first installed and ran this game, I could not believe how different of a game this was.  I looked nothing like Lords of the realm, and was one of the worst games I have ever played.  I played this game for about 3 hours, and then uninstalled it from my computer and threw it into an old storage room.  And I have never touched it since.  If I could have returned it I would have with haste.  Like a lot of reviewers have said here, save your money and avoid this piece of garbage.  You will be glad you did.  I wasted my money on this joke of a game; and I hope you don't.  Thanks. Horrible Game sequel

1.0	"My AX Pro headset died in a month. I tried contacting MadCatz for support, but they don't answer emails (just get back auto-replies), don't answer their phones (sit on hold till the call drops out), don't answer livechat (never anyone available), and their trouble ticket system has been ""down for maintenance"" for over a year.

It took 2 years to finally get a live person, but their support people stated they couldn't help me because my warranty was expired ignoring the fact that they're the reason why I wasn't able to contact them when it was still valid. After a lot of arguing they will only agree to a single repair with no further warranty support. They could toss any defective item in a box and send it to me and I'd have no way get further help.

Their warranty states that they guarantee a product free of defect for 1 year. I got 1 month and the offer of one shoddy repair!

I've sent emails all the way up the chain to the CEO/President, VP, and board of directors with my issue and with documentation showing when I first requested assistance and I've yet to receive a single reply.

Their message is clear: MadCatz doesn't stand by their products and doesn't care about their customers. If you want your money back you have to sue.

I've put complaints through to the BBB, FTC, RipoffReport among others, but still MadCatz will not respond!

Stay away from this company! They're a bunch of crooks! MadCatz will not give any support / Will not honor warranty!"
1.0	"After suffering through the first ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" game, I felt hopeless. I was dazed and confused. I didn't have a whisper of hope for the future of humanity. And then I saw the second game in the series on the shelves. I said, ""I'd heard the questions aren't repeated as much"", and I decided to buy it just to see if it was true.
It's true, the questions aren't repeated as much as before. The problem is, now they're MUCH harder! It's impossible to get anything higher than $16,000 now! And since the questions don't repeat, you'll never get to the top!
But what's the worst part? That's the ONLY CHANGE that was made to this game. NOTHING ELSE!!!!! It's as if the first game had no problems whatsoever! Regis is STILL appallingly rude and impatient, the ""Fastest Finger"" mode STILL doesn't let you put the four answers in order, the game STILL quits if you take too long to do things, you STILL can't skip the introduction sequence, the Phone-a-friend lifeline is STILL worthless, there's STILL no option to make the games easier or harder, you STILL only get instructions once, and there's STILL no option to use the mouse! Regis even says EXACTLY the same stuff as before!
I bought the game out of total curiosity, just to see if this game was really any better than the first. As it turns out, it is virtually the EXACT SAME GAME. It has all the problems of the first, except for one which was replaced by another one!
This game has not been improved one bit over the first.  The makers didn't even try to improve it.  This game displays total laziness and lack of creativity.  It's not worth one second of your time. Arrrrgh!!!! Make the pain go away!!!!"
1.0	Buyer beware, the game won't work without a connection to the 2K server. Microtransactions strike again. Too bad, cause otherwise a somewhat glitchy, but fun/beautiful game. Won't play without an Internet connection.
1.0	I have owned 2 AX360s and 1 AXPRO and I have had so send the AXPRO 2 times to get replaced!!! The internal mic connection fails and they have had to replace the headset every time!!I would rather use my AX360 even though they don't reproduce any base and the only way to control the in-game voice is to raise the center channel. I don't know you but I rather have a product that is not so good but reliable than something that breaks in 1 month and sounds good. By the way the first time I sent them in was because they already came with the same problem. The second time it happened I was using them and they just stopped receiving any sound through the mic. I bought various 2.5mm to 2.5mm male extension cables the first time it happened cause I though it was a faulty cable they brought only to find out that the problem was within the actual headset (confirmed by the fact that the company replaced my headset with a new pair).It actually feels like the company rushed into launching them and didn't actually test the product. Bad internal components!!!
1.0	I was an avid Sims 1 gamer.  I switched to The Sims 2 and was incredibly disappointed with it.  However, I stuck with it and eventually grew to love the game.  That just hasn't happened with The Sims 3.  I have tried to like it.  I really have.  My god how I have tried.  But I just can't.  The menu navigation is atrocious.  I spent half my time playing the game in build mode trying to find out how to build! It's cluttered and completely unappealing.  The seamless neighborhood feature intrigued me, but when my Sims that I had worked hard on moved out without my consent, I was pretty upset.  I don't really play the actual game very much, but I love to build in The Sims.  I rarely make any Sims at all.  I just love building houses.  One thing I loved about The Sims 2 was the ability to create new neighborhoods and place lots at your leisure.  I was SEVERELY disappointed to find out that this was impossible in The Sims 3.  Basically, this game is buggy, overpriced, overhyped, and not worth the DVD it's printed on.  I uninstalled it and went back to The Sims 2. Is this really The Sims?

1.0	"The Nokia N-Gage is a product that should not have been released. First of all, it tries to be everything to everyone but fails in the end. The games are mediocre (forgotten Playstation 1 ports) and the phone capabilities are subpar at best. I would also mention that the screen is oddly shaped for gaming and you have to literally take apart the entire back of the system (battery and all) to change games and THEN wait 2-3 minutes for it to boot up.
In a nutshell, save your $300 and get a GameBoy Advance. It is tailored more towards gaming with a much greater library and everything from the system design to screen size is what a portable gamer needs. Waste of time and money"
1.0	Junk Wont take charge
1.0	This game was a massive waste of time and money and a huge disappointment. I seriously will never buy another Blizzard game. This game was designed to mine money from players as much as possible and nothing else. After beating the campaign which takes about 4 days the game becomes repetitive and boring as hell. I hung in there and kept playing for a month or so, desperately hoping it would get better but it did not. 95-99% of the items are useless and can not be used by your character class and there are no legendary or set item drops ever and I mean none, period! It is a really boring game! Absolutely Terrible!!!!!!!!

There is absolutely no support for this game,so if you have problems like unable to save games,you can do what I did,uninstall the game and toss it in the garbage,thats where my Steel Tide ended up after 2 years.

1.0	Lots and LOTS of random battles, dumb characters, dumb gameplay, graphics that would look bad on the SNES (except for the constant battles). I played this when there were no other RPGs on the Playstation and I had the flu. With so many great RPGs out now, there is no reason for this game. Actually, there was no reason for it in the first place. I'm an RPG nut, but this one is just plain bad. Utterly awful
1.0	"...have i place such high expectations for a RPG only to receive a game that's barely playable, i got it the first day out but there are now known technical issues with the release of this game. after 2 hours of playing, my saved games were utterly corrupted and the game crashed consistantly back to the desktop. i have to manually delete some files just to be able to play. other technical issues have been raised in various forums that i will not address since i will assume that a workable patch will be available by the time this review is posted; instead i will mention the gameplay itself.
graphically, the game looks nice but it only has one resolution of 800x600 so you see a limited view of your party's immediate area. the pathing AI during combat is horrendous, often taking a longer route than necessary... this sometimes leads to your character running by an enemy, giving them an attack of opportunity against you; this can also negate your ability to attack -- depending on how far you need to move to an enemy, you may or may not be able to attack, taking a longer route even though it initially shows an attack icon means a wasted move. it's also hard to position your character to score flanking attacks. the combat manual is almost too cumbersome, though hotkeying commands help.
i like the point-buy system of generating your character's ability score which is sanctioned by AD&D rules and a very fair way of managing your needs. but your character starting equiptment sometimes doesn't make sense. your characters generally have a range weapon, a bow or sling, but no ammuno... arrows are really hard to find and was not sold by the first trader you meet (i haven't come across another trader/shopkeeper so far), yet most of the orcs you meet will launch arrows at your party.
this game follows 3E rules but pre-determines each character's feats, skills and abilities without input from the player. the characters does not appear balanced, the ranger for instance does NOT have the ability to use dual weapons (no one can) making the class much weaker than other fighter classes; the favored-enemy is pre-selected (at least on level one).
getting to level 2 is fairly straight forward but getting from level 2-3 is TEDIOUS -- it feels like most of the enemies encountered rarely provide much experience points. sometimes the enemies seemed harder to fight because your characters are so weak -- at level 2 your will face shadows and wraiths and only one or two of your party will have magical weapons at that point; once you are in combat mode, there is no way to retreat.
since you HAVE to keep your party together, you also can't send one character to do advance scouting (this oversight will be a huge disappoint especially if you play the multi-player mode).
overall, this feels like an unfinished game that's more of a dungeon crawler (with lower resolution and much less loot) than a true RPG -- the plot line so far is fairly trite. i am just severely disappointed that this game is linked to the excellent gold box series -- maybe it's unfair to make the comparison but if you carry the name Pool of Radiance, you've got to deliver. not since Ultima IX..."
1.0	Wow, first time I've ever been let down by HORI...disappointed. Disappointing
1.0	EA virtually has a monoply on sports games. EA Sports games are great, but there is almost no customer support. My three grown children and I all live in different cities, spread out over two states. We regularly purchase EA games to play together over our Xbox. EA Games discontinued the server for their older games. They say on their web site that it was a difficult decision and that 99% of their customers play the new games, so they could no longer afford the maintenance to support the 1% of their customers who play the older games. That I understand, but they have already discontinued some of their 2011 games, even before the year is over.  They are still selling games that they have already stopped the support on before the game is even purchased. What it boils down to is a subscription service for their games. You have to pay a monthly fee for the XBox, then you have to annually upgrade your games. If you play several different games and have four people in your family, that is a lot of money. If you do not intend to play EA games online, they are great games, but if you intend to play online with others, and cannot afford to replace your games each year, be warned. Tonight we learned that a couple of our newer games were just discontinued and as a family made the decision not to replace them anymore. STAY AWAY FROM EA!

1.0	"I had some time to kill after finishing the excellent ""Mask of the Betrayer"" and while waiting for ""Fallout 3"" to come out, so I thought I'd take ""Mass Effect"" for a spin.

All I can say is, ""Buh-bye fifty bucks!""

I played the game for a couple of hours or so, then finally gave up in boredom and frustration.

Unlike most RPGs today in which you control most of the game functions and character actions with the mouse, this game is almost totally controlled by keystrokes. This is a step backwards in technology of about ten years, in my opinion, and slows things down incredibly. Further, it requires memorizing all the appropriate key functions; like stepping back in time from Windows to MS-DOS.

The character inventory system is clunky and counter-intuitive, and very cumbersome to manipulate.

Worse yet, you can't exit cut/movie scenes to re-enter gameplay, so if you're having to repeat an action from a save, you have to sit through these looooong cut scenes repeatedly.

Not ready for Prime Time, folks. Save your bucks! Worst player interface EVER"
1.0	to put it nicely A PIECE OF JUNK One Star
1.0	"I loved this game, i looked forward to playing it anytime i could, but now after the update it realy sucks..it has NOTHING to do with the movies.

After the Combat upgrade the game went down hill, they added alot of silly things from the EverQuest 2 game that does NOT make any sence at all in starwars..and its far 2 buggy.

I will give them a little tiem to fix it and take it away ( and I guess they will not cause they are so smart ) bah!  Help Lucas where are you?!

Starwars was a more serious game, playd by both young AND old..noe people are leaving in hordes..50 % of the Chimaera server left cause of the Combat upgrade..old players..are getting rare in soem places...they go to Guild wars or WoW..

So overall play for my part is runined in this game, and I do not see if a layal fan don't even like it ( yes i like fanatasy, but this in SWG now is just silly )anyothers will think its a crap game.

Please Lucas! take charge! let us have back the star wars as in the movies, we don't want Star Quest ( as starwars now looks like everQuest..which sux and is silly )

so save yer money buy World of warcraft or Guildwars!

From now on I won't buy a keyboard unless it has a well designed, short proof plug. bad connector
1.0	Everyone who bought this horrible game should band together and sue for our money back. This game is HORRIBLE! You can't Control the main characters movements! Super super glitchy. I can't believe the game was released like this!?!? And i was so excited for it after Black Flag (which I loved). DO NOT buy this game. I wouldn't pay $5 for it. Steer clear. Are you Kidding Me?!
1.0	Graphics are as bad as the Nintendo 64.  The game makes no sense in general, and the instructions are terrible.  It doesn't feel like you are really fishing as I had hoped, because you just push buttons, which makes no sense.  Don't buy!  At least if you are thinking of buying it, RENT it first, you will see what I mean. Bad
1.0	The slim model is unlike any other console redesign the world has seen. Normally a redesign is a way for developers to sort out the bugs found in the first version, but (lol) Sony just created more. The machine lasted a grand 30 seconds before shorting out and stopped reading discs. As much as I hate my original Playstation 2 for being clunky and having the occasional errror message, the slim wasn't much of an improvement. If you want 6th generation console fun, buy a Gamecube, which will not break, has great games, and cost only 15 bucks for a refurbished model at Gamestop. What a joke
1.0	"If you liked titanfall 1 you will hate this. First it was nice to get a campaign that is stand alone 5 STARS, I give this game a 1 since the multi player is - (Minus) 4 stars.  I played the Beta test and thought they would make changes, Not only did they not make changes, They changed all of the buttons! Now to Respawn you press ""X"""" Not ""A"", and to change to your anti titan weapon is no longer the ""D"" pad you press ""Y"", All the maps have dead ends and rooms with no doors so you are always getting stuck, You ALWAYS respawn Miles away from the action and where you died, Windows don't break and you can't shoot them out, or shoot thru them,  and the list goes on. Wait till your in a titan, they changed all that too, you'll die button mashing trying to just walk! I played 5 games and all the maps were the Beta Maps, That are HORRIBLE!!! This is not Titanfall this is Call of Duty with annoying big Robots, large open spaces so you can't wall run, kill ratio is wacked so your always dieing, snipers on every roof, like I said just like Call of Duty. All of the Titans pack together, since if your alone you die in less than 3 seconds. You last longer as a pilot than in a titan. (same from the Beta test) Your titan will last longer in auto mode than if your in it. (since the auto titan knows how to play better than you) This is nothing more than a Call of Duty Clone that has lost direction. No doubt this will become a $19.99 game in less than a month. I had such high hopes, only to be shattered by this.
Go back and play Titanfall 1, even though there is not a campaign, the maps, game play, and titans are more fun than this. Gone is the popcorn jumping, super wallrun speeds, being able to really take down a titan with rodeo, not some animation of you putting in a grenade in titanfall 2 (and if you rodeo them 5 (or more) times, where are all these grenades coming from??)  They took the cheap way out having you watch little movies of you doing an action, I want to control the action, not watch little animations the whole game. What about games like ""on deadly ground"" for TF1, The ground is covered with a toxic smoke and you must wall run and stay above the ground to survive and get the other teams flag. Titan Defense, Burn cards, Smart Pistol, Data Knife, Hacking Specters,  Things that made Titanfall a unique, stand out, and stand alone game that no one could touch. Gone. Noting that made the game unique is there, Epic fail for the multi player.
For upgrading your titan, forget about it. They are what they are. You have to earn an upgrades, but they are worthless and meaningless. It's like they couldn't figure out what to do so they simply say your now 2.0, then 3.0 and it means nothing. You get nothing for upgrading or leveling up, so what is the point? This game is really like a Alpha release that still need A LOT of work to even make it playable or enjoyable. The game seems to be geared for 10 - 12 year olds If you liked titanfall 1 you will hate this"

1.0	The game is well done graphically, the visuals are wonderful, the new 3d style is well done again graphically and the fun factor is decent.  Compared to the awesome control of Mario U im still trying to get used to the controls in a 3d style as for me Mario will always be a 2d game regardless of how good the graphics are. In this game and Mario U they are stunning but this game is hard to navigate as it's damn near impossible to determine where you going to land....again I love the smooth controls and camera angles of Mario U.  The multiplayer is kind of fun, my wife and I tried to enjoy it but it gets frustrating quickly for the control/camera limitations I mentioned above.  Once again going through the levels together is tough and if you get a little ahead of the other player(s) it kills you all or bubbles everyone which is very annoying.  The next thing is the cat suit power up, its way to overused like in every level, where are the racoon suits?  If you die 5 times in a level you get the while tanookie suit rendering you invincible save from pit falls which this whole game is.....  Overall Mario U is all you need for a great new Mario game this one is a real dud, it tries to pride itself on nestalgia but fails and the levels range from easy as hell to damn near impossible again due to the 3d mess of the controls and camera angles.  Not worth 60+ dollars by any stretch. Bad camera angles lead to bad controls and becomes boring quickly.
1.0	"Meh.

Some are having luck with this receiver, while others simply are not and I'm afraid you're S.O.L. if you get a DOA device. As a little background, I'm a systems admin for a Fortune 500 company, which doesn't prove anything, but I can tell you I know what I'm doing when it comes to peripherals and their device drivers. Indeed, the instructions included with the receiver were misleading, so definitely follow the step-by-step in one of the reviews here. I was able to pair my PS3 controller to the receiver without any issue--that was actually rather easy, and doesn't require the skills of a system admin. However, the receiver I got was unfortunately defective. Again, the pairing went fine, but failed to properly send the input signal to my PC. I went through typical troubleshooting steps, including COMPLETELY reinstalling the driver software, PROCMON trace, etc., but there's no way around a dead unit.

Unfortunately, PS3 controllers don't quite play nice with Windows or other systems. Good for you if you do get a working unit, though I'm 0/1 and other reviews here have noted they tend to die after some time of use. I'll continue using Better DS3 and keep my controller wired. If you want to go the wireless route with ease and stability, it seems the XBox controller is the way to go. I simply can't recommend this Mayflash receiver to anyone. Junk!"
1.0	LOUSY  GAME--- FREE GET WHAT IS WORTH LOUSY GAME--- FREE GET WHAT IS
1.0	"I loved the Splinter Cell series, I have owned everyone and I ended up buying this one.  Big mistake, the single player is around 6 hours long even on highest difficulty.  The story is ok, but really short.  Multi-Player is seriously broken, it is almost impossible to play as there is never a game to get into, I finally got into one and it was so laggy it was unplayable.  I bought it on steam and ended up paying $65 which is the most expensive game on the market.  The DRM is brutal, you have to have Internet connection throughout the game, even when I still had Internet, the game quit saying I had no Internet and I had to start the area over.

This game completely turned me off from Splinter Cell series and UBI Soft in general. Last straw"
1.0	If you are overseas don't get.  I am in Korea and it is region locked.  I am not sure why but don't buy...also Amazon won't refund you money if you want it back.  I still would like to try it.  I have heard it is a good game. Don't get off Amazon..if
1.0	"Let me first say that I loved the NBA2k Series. I think NBA2k12 is one of the best sports games ever made. That's why it's so frustrating to play this game. When I first got the game, I put it in expecting to get a quick game or two in.... however, 2k had other ideas as it took almost 45 minutes to install. By that time, I had switched to the 360 while it installed.

A few days later, I finally got around to playing the game. I started with GM mode only to find features that were present in previous games were now taken away. I couldn't force trades if the computer was being ridiculous. Also, I set it up for a 21 game season with injuries off only to find I was set up with an 82 game season and Russell Westbrook got injured in the first week of playing. Awesome.

Now, fast forward to today. I want to play my franchise, but I can't connect to the 2k servers (my internet is working fine because I'm able to stream mlb.tv) so I'm stuck with a game I can't play.

I'm giving it two stars because it's fun when it works, but I can't begin to express how disappointing this game is and how far 2K Sports has fallen. I would not advise anyone to buy this game and instead wait until next year or buy on another system, because this game is a complete waste on the XBox One.

Update: 4/29. 2K servers are down again so I'm left with a game I paid full price that I can't play. I'm forced to take my review down to 1 star because this happens at least once or twice a week. Please Please Please do not buy this game. It's a lemon. Buggy and Requires Always On Connection (XBox One)"
1.0	"I suggest buying the board games before buying this Wii game.  The controls on this game are terrible.  4 of us (ages 20-35) tried playing Yahtzee, and after much frustration, gave up and went and played a board game.  The problem is that sometimes the game won't let you click where you need to click.  The interface with the Wii-mote is just really poor.  This is a disappointing title overall and I can't imagine buying it for children.

In all fairness though, can't really comment on many of the games besides Yahtzee.  We tried Sorry Sliders and the game just seems random though overall it worked OK.

The only good part of this title is the host: Mr. Potato head.  He kept us thorougly amused thoughout Yahtzee with his hilarious faces.

We gave up on this title pretty quickly and I doubt it will be used again.  If you watch for sales, you can probably pick up most of the board games included here for the same price. You're better off buying the board games..."
1.0	"I really wish I would have known this before I bought it. This program has ZERO complatibility with Windows XP. In other words: it's useless. The company has gone out of business, so there will be no updates. Trust me, I've found about 30 cases on the net of people with the same problem.
Do not buy this unless for some reason you have a computer with awesome hardware that isn't running Windows XP (why would you have such a machine?).
If you have the awesome computer running old windows OR you are like 99% of the other gamers like myself who have good hardware AND Windows XP, download EPSXE (...). You will have to find a PS bios. The configuration wizard will give you instructions on how to find it. I know this setup is tedious, but there is no other way to play playstation games on an XP machine. Does not work with Windows XP"
1.0	I bought this game because everybody was getting on the KOF bandwagon. I was never a huge fan of KOF  before, but I decided to give it a chance. I'm not even going to whine or groan about the graphics. Yes, they look like PS2 graphics, but oh well. My biggest problem is just how boring the combos are. In games like Mortal Kombat or Guilty Gear you have lots of combo possibilities. In this, not so much. Most combos are like two hits and then you have to cancel in a special and then climax cancel. This game is very sub par. There was a scene starting to build up but just about everybody I know who started playing it has dropped the game already. Save your money. they look like PS2 graphics
1.0	worst game ever return for ur money get a better game
1.0	"The time it takes to load one sequence to the next is more than enough to ruin the entire gameplay experience for anyone.  Imagine a scenario where it takes about 5 minutes to complete a quest but if you die during that attempt, you end up sitting there for about 2 minutes just waiting for it to reload so you can try again...  NOW... do that over and over and over and over... until the whole experience is ruined by spending more time waiting for the game to reload than most people spend watching tv commercials during their favorite shows.

Sure the game is fun for a while.  It's nice to play around and see just how many things you can tether together and wreak havoc along with tons of laughs....  But let's be serious here.  that kind of dwindles down after the first couple of hours.  Whoever designed this game didn't really put a whole lot of effort into making it reasonably diversive.  Every chair looks the same, every ball, every table... and to top it off, in a game world of thousands of people, perhaps it would be a good idea to make more than just a dozen people and clone them over and over again.  It's only funny the first couple of times to watch some lady in a dress riding a motor cycle.  I actually stood on a roof top and there were four people there... ALL the same person.

The story line doesn't make any sense.  What I mean by that is that you can go around and free every village on the game and then go back and do the story line where apparently nobody has been freed yet.  There is just no order to this.

The tether and wing-suit is the only thing I like about this game.  It's the one thing that GTA5 is missing and if GTA5 had it, I would never come back to this game again.  To be honest, I'm really not sure if I will anyway.  24 to 48 hours larter... and the game is just boring and redundant.  And where is the realism here?  I get shot once by a sniper and die...  but I get nuked 18 times before falling off a cliff and the 15 foot drop kills me.  WUT?

""Just Cause""  It's the perfect name for this game.  Cause if someone were to ask me why I'm still playing it ...I say ""just cause""  Maybe they should call it ""Just bored"".  It's a better answer. Just not what I expected at all."
1.0	Boring Boring
1.0	THis game suck. Also it glitched out on me and I was unable to finished it. One Star
1.0	Puke, why calm this socom? It's more like Seth Luisi's incest love child with 2 left thumbs. Buy a ps4 in Jan 2015 and pick up H-Hour from Sof Studios. David Spears, one of the original creators of Socom I and II from Zipper, launched this concept on Kickstarter and will be ready for release in feb 2015! G^ noobs Buahaha don't buy this hot garbage

*******************
UPDATED (5/18/2012)
*******************

I'll keep this review short given that there are 800+ reviews for this game already.

(I have the collector's edition which is why I don't show up as a 'verified purchase')

THE GOOD:
=========

1. Fun to play
It's still fun to play, although it is still the same mindless, hack and slash, quasi-RPG game that the previous two are.

2. Decent presentation
Graphics and sound (music/sound effects/etc) are pretty solid, if uninspired.

3. Isometric view
I am really glad that they did not turn this game into a first person view game, like Bethesda did with Fallout 3.

THE BAD
=======

1. Server ""issues""
'Nuff said.  Surprising given that it took Blizzard 12 years to come out with this game.

2. Quasi-RPG, with NO CHARACTER BUILDS/CUSTOMIZATION (i.e. LITTLE REPLAY VALUE)
Nothing is permanent, including character 'development'.  By choosing to not allow players to increase specific character attributes (dexterity, strenth, etc.), Blizzard really took out the ""quasi"" in ""quasi-RPG"".  It's actually a straight up action game, with skills automatically unlocked automatically based on XP the SAME FOR EVERYONE.  So absolutely ZERO character customizations.  Forget about agonizing over how to develop your character, because Blizzard has decided to dumb it down for you and make everything possible at any time.  Don't like your current skills?  Well, just choose another one, they're all available after all!  Ridiculous decision and quite possibly the worst thing about this game.

3. Complete Re-hash of Diablo II (i.e. NOT VERY INTERESTING TO PLAY THE FIRST TIME)
This game is basically D2 with updated graphics and worse voice acting and absolutely zero atmostphere.  The maps seem so familiar that you could probably do the entire game from memory even if you have never played it before, as long as you have played D2.  Specifically...

4. Lack of Randomized dungeons (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)
Everything is in the same location, or so it seems at least.  The continental maps are the same, so everytime you play a game online you join the mad rush of players all running towards destinations like rats who have mastered a maze.  The 'dungeons' (there are actually few dungeons), or locations, all seem to be minimally varied at all game to game.  This makes the game lose a lot of its REPLAY VALUE.  Let's say that this game has very low replay value unless you want to play all the characters through all the difficulty levels and get them all up to level 60 or whatever the highest level is.  No point in ever playing the same class twice, since there is no 'build' anymore for characters.

5. Lack of Atmosphere
It really looks like WoW in an isometric view.  Completely gone is the claustrophobic, disturbing, and foreboding atmosphere of D1.  Everything looks cartoonish, which is exacerbated by the veritable fireworks display of all colors everytime you use just about any skill.  Not to mention that many weapons have a neon glow to them even when not in use.  Don't be surprised to see a barbarian running around with bright neon orange and green axes in his hands.  And a coop battle looks like you're at some kind of a rave or Phish concert.

6. Miscellaneous
Bad writing, distracting attempts at humor, very poor voice acting (especially Leah), and tedious intro/cutscenes.

OVERALL:
========
3/5 for mindless fun
2/5 for overall quality of the game

++
********************
(UPDATED (5/18/2012)
********************

So, I finished the game on 'normal' difficulty and got up to level 31 with my Demon Hunter.  Add a few new ""goods"" and ""bads"" for this game...

GOOD
====

1. Better Cutscenes
The ones at the end are better than the earlier ones (e.g. it's possible to watch it through without hitting ESC).

2. Still Fun (for now...)
Yes, it is still fun to play, despite the numerous deficiencies mentioned previously.  Once I finish the game on the hardest difficulty, I cannot imagine playing it again until the inevitable expansion pack(s) comes out.  I will play all the difficulty levels though and the expansion packs, which should say something about the casual playability of this game.  Despite the limitations on and simplification of character development, it is still fun to 'unlock' new skills to use.  Much of the fun does derive from leveling (read: grinding) and item collection (who doesn't still love to collect rare, unique, and now legendary items?).

BAD
===

1. Too SHORT!!! (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)
Maybe 15-20 hours and I finished the game in normal difficulty, and I cannot believe how SHORT THIS GAME IS.  It's shocking actually, and it does not help that the acts are so similar to D2.  For some reason I expected this game to be much longer and expansive compared with D2, similar to how D2 was much more immense in scope compared with D1.  But no, there are still just 4 (I think) acts that are fairly short and easy to complete.

2. Lame Bosses/Lairs (i.e. Zzzzzz...)
Most of the bosses in D3 are pretty lame.  Half of them are just gigantic, bulbous and obese monstrosities that are barely distinguishable from one another.  Only Diablo himself appears significantly unique.  The lairs are similarly boring... most are just gigantic square rooms that you run around endlessly trying to avoid getting injured.  The boss action, of course, is pure 'grinding' at its finest.  In the later acts, the bosses are almost back to back to back, which to be quite honest got tired really fast, especially when they all seemed the same.

3. Horrible Skill Interface/System (i.e. FORGET ABOUT SWITCHING THEM IN A BATTLE!)
Yes, the way that you switch between skills is very cumbersome and involves opening up a skills window and then clicking on various tabs to select different skills and their runes (which are not physical items either) that was not intuitive at all at the beginning, and even when you get used to it still prevents easy switching of skills.  Fine, let there be a 'cool off' time for switching skills, but requiring the skills window to open up in order to change skills is beyond annoying and really means you're not likely to do it in a battle.  So, that means that essentially you're stuck with a half dozen skills, max, at any given time.  This feels very limited and boring, especially when you have all these skills that you unlocked and would like to use with some variety to keep things fun.

4. Linear Gameplay (i.e. GO FROM A > B > C > D...)
More so than D1 or even D2, D3 is super linear.  There is very little exploration you can do except for on the world maps, and even then there are blockades that need to be unlocked as part of some quest or another, limited your ability to explore.

OVERALL
=======
It is still a fun game but very disappointing in many ways.  Primarily the lack of character attribute/skill customization (e.g. no 'builds'), the sense of deja vu that you get when you play due to the game being so similar in design to Diablo 2, and the small scope of the game.  I couldn't believe that Diablo came so soon, and when he died I was wondering if there would be another act or something, but alas, it just ended with a whimper and yet another cutscene.

3/5 for mindless fun
2/5 for overall quality of the game

********************
(UPDATED (5/20/2012)
********************

BOTTOM LINE
===========

So, I got my character up to level 50 and finished D3 on nightmare difficulty and... I just uninstalled it.  The truth is, the more you play, the higher level you achieve, the less you want to continue playing.  This mostly is a result of the lack of character development/customization (and by that, I mean inability to assign attribute points or selectively develop/specialize skills as in D2) and the overall similarity to D2.  The over-simplication (and let's not forget that D2 was a pretty simple game to begin with... hardly real RPG type character development or gameplay) really is the downfall of this otherwise serviceable game.  The bottom line is -- it's just not that fun to play over and over again.  It's also laughable that Blizzard is trying to squeeze even more money out of their fans pockets with the Auction House, which no normal person would (or could) actually use to try to make money off of the game.  I remember selling various items from D2 on ebay (remember the 'grandfather sword' anyone?) but it's hard to imagine that anyone would do the same with this game.

In the end, I have to say that while fun for awhile, D3 is ultimately a massive disappointment to fans of the series.  For me, it provided less than a week of gameplay, unlike D2 that I played for months and months.  It is not the kind of Blizzard product that the company built its reputation on during the 1990s and 2000s, and is clearly showing the unfortunate influence of big company marketing in the development of one of its most popular franchises.  Unless the direction that Blizzard takes with their games (e.g. dumbing down and simplifying their games to achieve more widespread appeal) changes, I will NOT be buying another Blizzard product ever.  Thank God for Kickstart, which has brought back the possibility of independent game development back from the dead (Wasteland 2!!!)...

Final (downgrade) Rating:
2/5 for brief, mindless fun
1/5 for overall quality of the game

*******************
UPDATED (6/1/2012)
*******************

Yes, I know I said the last update would be the last but I had a few things to add.

So, I have the collector's edition (completely worth the $100 given all the goodies it comes with), which includes D2/LOD on a USB flash drive.  After uninstalling D3 (after 6 days of gameplay getting my Demon Hunter up to lvl 50 and finishing on nightmare difficulty), I decided to see how D2 looked and played (haven't played it since 2001, after getting the LOD expansion pack) after all these years.

Well, D2/LOD is still great!  I've been playing for about two weeks (more than twice the time I played D3 for), building a Werebear Druid, and I am amazed with the superiority of this game over the follow-up that took 12 years to be released but feels like a cheap imitation of the real deal.

MORE BAD THINGS ABOUT DIABLO 3
==============================

1. HAND-HOLDING AND DUMBED DOWN GAMEPLAY (e.g. D3 NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE TABLET GAMER CROWD!!)
Yes, the geniuses at Blizzard decided that D3 had to be super noob friendly to help ensure the most widespread adoption by casual gamers.  So, LOOT that drops from monsters for each player in a multiplayer game INDIVIDUALLY, which other players cannot see let alone pickup.  I mean, how stupid is that?  It makes no sense for this to happen and is an example of extent of the absurd hand-holding and 'noob-ification' of this game.

Another example is the ELIMINATION of the use of TOWN PORTAL or IDENTIFY scrolls.  What a hassle to use those items when Blizzard could just simplify the game to get rid of them, and instead allow players to press a button at any time to magically teleport themselves back to town (complete with a silly animation of the players crouching and white energy balls emanating from their hands), right?  And identify scrolls, a RPG staple from the earliest days, well, why not get rid of that silly hassle too and allow players to identify any item just by right clicking on it?

Frustrated by having to explore the square continental MAPS searching for important locations (well, the first time you play through that is, because those locations don't appear to ever change)?  Well, no problem because the good folks at Blizzard have decided that exploration is a waste of time and so they make ARROWS and other indicators appear on the map that SHOW YOU WHERE TO GO, and if you are close to an important place.  Yes D2 act 1 had a road that would lead you to adjacent maps, but nothing even close to this level of hand-holding.  Can anyone really question the noob-ification and extreme linearness of this game?  There's not even an option to turn those map 'hints'/guides off.

Yet another example is the noob-ification of the GEAR REPAIR/durability system.  In D3, items have a durability rating (e.g. 24/24) but that never seems to decrease (or at least, very slowly), despite using your weapons and taking damage.  Even if an item does break you can simply get it FIXED by the blacksmith guy, so really what was the point?  In D2 (and other RPGs), you fix your gear so that it doesn't break because typically you can't just weld a broken sword back together again!

And of course, don't forget that monsters now drop HEALTH ORBS that raise your life instantly when you walk over them, instead of health potions that needed to be then be consumed in order to get healed.

So, yes -- Diablo 3 has been SIMPLIFIED and DUMBED DOWN to the level of an arcade side shooter game.  Hell, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog with gear grinding!

2. ABSURD STORY
By now most Diablo fans have heard about the absurd and cringe-inducing story of D3 (I won't 'spoil' it for those of you who haven't played it yet, but it involves a human and a certain demon mating and producing a very annoying NPC).  D2, on the other hand, had a reasonably interesting and fairly well thought out (if not particularly original) story of the 'Dark Wanderer' (your character from D1), which provides the backdrop for D2.  And don't even get me started on the most ridiculous NPC from the Diablo series, Leah...

3. 4-PLAYER CO-OP LIMIT
Eight player co-op games in D2 are great -- too bad you're limited to only four players in D3.  Just stupid.

4. OTHER BATTLE.NET ISSUES
The game creation system for multiplayer co-op has also been simplified, in a bad way.  You can't name your games or even play in a game with other players unless you are on the same exact quest.  It's very limiting and substantially decreases the online replay value (which is not very high to begin with, unfortunately).

5. SILLY D1 'BOSS' CAMEO
Yes, you've all heard the rumors/spoilers about the return of a Diablo 1 boss (arguably the most famous and well-liked boss from the Diablo series) in D3.  No, it makes no sense why this character, who was killed in D1, would return (complete with memorable catchphrase), but apparently Blizzard thought this would be some sort of a 'treat' for Diablo fans.  It's not.

6. DEMON HUNTER WEARS STILETTO HEELS
Seriously?  In hindsight, this probably should have tipped me off as to the quality of the game that I was so eagerly awaiting.

CONCLUSION
==========
Don't believe all those 'expert' reviews on the internet, like the mindboggling 100% rating (!!) from Joystiq.  These online blogs are hardly objective to any degree, due to direct advertising revenue they receive from game companies and/or other perks they may receive (e.g. being invited to Blizzard headquarters for exclusive sneak peaks, etc.) that unduly influences their game reviews.  In light of this, it is unsurprising that there are so many highly favorable reviews for D3.

This does not obscure the fact that Diablo 3 is simply a mediocre game.  Actually, it's below average.  It gets a 1 star rating from me because of how much worse of a game in many ways (gameplay, battle.net, etc.) it is than its predecessor, the great Diablo 2 despite how long it took (12 years, holy smokes!) to finally come out, and because of Blizzard's thinly veiled primary objective of squeezing as much money out of players with the Real Money Auction House -- a feature that detracts from the item finding fun of the game to a significant degree.

Bottom line?  Diablo 3 is fun to play... for a few days.  The problem is that it lacks much of the substance which made Diablo 2, and even Diablo 1, so much more engaging to play... and play again and again.  Perhaps the most accurate description is that D3 is an uninventive and unoriginal reworking of a great game, with deal-breaking noob-ification and over simplifaction of gameplay dynamics and online play.  I would recommend waiting for the inevitable, and likely imminent, price drop before picking this one up. Fun but rehash of Diablo 2"
1.0	I am so disappointed by how awful the game looks like. It looks like a PSP game, not Wii U! Shame on Capcom! I also hate how the game is almost exactly the same as the other MH games! Why not improve the gameplay? Improve the dull style? The game is fun, but feels like a handheld game!! The boss fights are the best part, other than that, it's nothing new! Good game!
1.0	"I'm basically here to cast my vote into the Amazon pool of user reviews, but I will not expound upon the things which disappoint me so much about Dragon Age 2; I've spent too much time already posting in the official forums and corresponding with other players about this game to have the heart to do it again.

For the record: because I wanted to like this game so much I gave it two complete play-throughs with different character types, different play-styles, and on different difficulties. Yes, it was difficult to play so much of a game that I eventually ended-up despising, but I had such high hopes for this series (mostly because of Dragon Age: Origins and my history with BioWare) that I had to be sure I was giving the game a fair shake.

If you liked Dragon Age: Origins -- stay away from this game; it has none of the attention to detail, none of the sense of grandeur, and certainly much less of a heart than it's predecessor. (Well, the graphics are ""better"" in DA2, but Origins managed to keep my interest regardless of its slightly-less-than-amazing graphics; the ""more polished"" look of DA2 was not enough to keep my interest.)

If you liked Mass Effect 2: stick to that series of games; DA2 is not a ""fantasy"" version of Mass Effect 2, and is merely borrowing some mechanics and awkwardly thrusting them into what was already a successful (and vastly different) series.

If you're a BioWare fan because of Baldur's Gate and related games (like me), then there is little for you to love in Dragon Age 2.

If you want to know why this game is so terrible (in a mechanical way, and not speaking about the fact that it's a half-hearted, rushed, big-corporate-production aimed at cashing-in on the success of it's predecessor) then read some of the other reviews here on Amazon, click over to MetaCritic and read the USER reviews, and visit the official BioWare forums.

BioWare fans: you have been wronged, and the world of video games has another artless plastic box taking-up shelf space all over the world.

The game world has several examples of what happens when developers do a rushed, half-hearted job because of responses to ""marketing analysis"" and pressure from the publisher; ""Ultima 9"" and ""Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within"" were always my two favorite examples, but Dragon Age 2 is getting added to that list. I'm tired of writing about how disappointed I am..."
1.0	If you're looking for grip... you're not gonna get it with this. It gets the controller crazily dirty underneath the skin, and if your hands sweat when you're using this, you will not get any grip. You're better off not using this if you have sweaty hands while gaming. It WON'T make a difference. As for the texture of the product, it's very thin, looking like it'll rip easily, and it seems to have a little bit of friction. Doesn't help for grip
1.0	I loved all my Mario games growing up, so I thought I'd love the tennis game as well. Sadly, the controls weren't accurate, and there are too many special powers of each of the characters that makes the game harder to get through. We played for about 20 minutes and decided to pack it up. I'm now re-listing it for sale. I was disappointed, but perhaps it is because I'm too much older now to enjoy it as I might have in my childhood. It just wasn't right for us
1.0	The Age of Empires: Mythology cartridge I got was full of programming errors: the AI couldn't handle the Norse. The game would crash... and if a player finished the battle it would not calculate the score correctly. Did they do a recall? The game was clearly defective. Comedy of Errors
1.0	My image of Madcatz was starting to change for the better until this expensive toy was played.  Half the keys I hit and both the white and black key register!  This is NOT user error since I've taken years of piano lessons.  Needless to say I was unable to enjoy the game the way I hoped.  The issue now is that the PS3 keyboard is low stocked everywhere so I'll be forced to wait either way and debating whether to return to store or return to manufacturer.  BUMMER. Stupid keyboard was broken out of the box
1.0	"The toy is fine but the charity it supports is a major issue. the autism speaks people message is that all people who are one the autism spectrum are burdens on others. Being a person on the Autism spectrum I find this a major insult. I work hard to bring others up in life and help all I can I am no burden. Autism Speaks Promotes the actions and thinking that scared my in my early life. Please don't support this put your money elsewear. Don't fund the abuse that Autism Speaks promotes.

Worse part this is my favorite new character. Don't Support Autism Speaks"
1.0	The only good thing about this game is the graphics. Other than that it's pretty boring. It's basically Arkham City with better graphics and the Batmobile. This was very disappointing cause of how good the other 3 games where. Now I have to wait for Halo 5, Star Wars, and Black Ops 3. Ugh! :/ The wait! Overall I give this game a 3/10 Boring
1.0	dont ever buy this, if the power chord is shifted at all it turns the xbox into red ring mode so you have to reset it, probly not good for the xbox either not the seller its the product
1.0	"It's just not that special. I liked Digimon world for Psx and 2, but this doesn't come close. It's ALL japanese voice acting and you have to read everything. I can hardly take it serious,  the women are sexy, but I'd expect that in a different type of game.

The start takes Forever to take off, and it's too many different options etc..also, it just doesn't feel like a digimon game. Now don't get it wrong, the digimon are awesome,  especially the original ones, but  they are too much of them, so it's not like you can really bond with them. The game story revolves around hacking and the net more than Digimon, and I just would have preferred this to have a different title.

2 out of 5. I'll be trading this in tomorrow.  ALSO,  THE characters are like, I just Dont like them that much. Besides the main character.  And what happened to training the Digimon yourself and not just sending them to some training farm. That's lazy. Screw you I wanted to love this game, its not what you think."
1.0	"BUYER BEWARE!!!! My wife purchased a 40GB model PS3 that included the Sixaxis controller for $399.99,on July 10, 2008 for my Birthday. She also purchased the Dual Shock controller for me as well, being that that model did not come with it. She then also purchased a 2.5"" 5400RPM 80GB hard drive to replace the smaller 40GB Hard drive in the PS3. When I recieved the PS3 and accessories on July 14, 2008, I looked at Amazon's website to find that that model had been discontinued and the new model had an 80GB Hard Drive and Dual Shock Controller included for the same price of $399.99. So I was taken advantage of by selling the older model for the newer model price and making me pay 109.98 extra for the upgrades. I have no use for the older controller and the old hard drive will not work in anything other than a PS3, so it is useless as well. Everytime I have tried to resolve the issue over the phone with Amazon, they leave me on hold and eventually hang up on me. I have now just sent E-mail detailing the situation and am now leaving these reviews up for all of the customers like you to be aware of what kind of tactics they are trying to pull. These older 40GB models of PS3 can be sent back to the manufacturer by Amazon for a credit, yet they still pawned it off on me!?!?! Amazon is usually a pretty oggod company as far as customer service is concerned, so I am hoping that this is just one that fell through the crack and one that they will remedy when all you guys read this and they get my E-mail. It is now December 17,2008 and still trying, will keep all you potential PS3'ers informed. BUYER BEWARE!!!!! AMAZON DECIEVED ME!!!"
1.0	This game sucks and was not worth the plastic this turd was housed in.  The NES version was better than this and this was SNES!  The sound in this version was nice, the gameplay was terrible. Nes version was better!
1.0	I heard great things about this game and was excited to play. It's completely open world and you can do whatever you'd like in the game. However I found it to be frustrating, boring and not pretty to look at. Just not for me
1.0	Pigs, cows, and women, oh my!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BRITISH ARE COMING. THE BRITISH ARE COMING
1.0	"This game was 10 years in the making and what a disappointment. We are a year after release and the game is still a disappointment.

Pro's:
Pretty much none, if you really had to reach for one I guess you could say the graphics were ok.

Con's:
- Little content on release
- No depth to the game or characters
- No character customization
- Still can't even dye legendary or set items
- Very limited stash
- A year later and they have only added minor updates like monster power, paragon levels, brawling
- They released an article showing ""how much work they have done"" on diablo over the past year, and had so little work to show for it that they had to include the PTR data and multiple versions of each release they did to make it look like there was far more content added than there really was.
- game economy is in the trash, gold is worthless once again.
- Constant glitches, hacks, and gold spammers again
- last round of glitches allowed billions of gold to be duped by players (not the first time, and certainly not going to be the last).
- Game is still unstable crashing on occasion and lagging for many people still. Once again the game crashed on my Hardcore monk without a single mob around and yet he somehow still dies.
- Customer support is a joke, Blizzard has proven time and time again that they could care less about customer satisfaction. Any time they have issues they simply take down the boards and all support lines so people can't publicly complain. I guess if they can pretend they don't see it they can pretend it doesn't exist.
- Crafting once again is nearly worthless.
- Items are worthless, I have level 60's of every char and have played hundreds of hours and found hundreds of legendaries and yet the best item I have found was mediocre at best. Almost everything you pick up off the ground is nearly worthless.

There are so many issues with this game it's a joke. This should have been a major title for Blizzard and they not only dropped the ball, but they popped it and set it on fire. This is the last straw for me. I refuse to purchase any future Blizzard games as they have proven without a doubt that they simply don't care about their customer base. Don't waste your money on this game and for gods sake don't waste any money on the real money auction house. Show them that you demand better quality games by hitting them in the wallet where it hurts since money is the only thing they care about. Piss Poor Game, stop supporting crappy developers"
1.0	I have no idea how so many people are giving this 5 stars this game is just for perves that want to see boobs bounce and clothing ripe off. u can beat this intire game in less then 3 hours. I am very happy I rented this before buying total crap
1.0	This does not even work at all the mic or the headphones total waste of money asking for refund. Horrible Horrible Horrible. Horrible.
1.0	Needs Origin One Star
1.0	The Razer Naga has come a long way from it's first couple iterations with poor drivers. Now the Razer Synapse as a driver is worlds away from the product that first came out. The product fell flat. I bought the new Razer Naga on March 17 and by July, it stopped working consistently. It will randomly stop moving. I changed the mouse pad and made sure the unit was clean, but it just stops working from time to time. Unplugging and plugging it back in does nothing. Right now it is a paper weight. Great software, but bad product durability. Stopped working after a few months.
1.0	This game is really bad. I wouldn't pay 10 bucks for it.  Wish I would of read the reviews  first.  The gba sims is better even the ds version is better then this.  Really disappointed in it. Sucks
1.0	Stop making games require the internet, its not a thing.real gamers want immersive offline ,way too many disrespectful children online, gaming should be fun like it was on Xbox 360,ps3,and now ps4. I own both consoles and Microsoft is giving nothing back. We have hardly any exclusive plays.save yourself. stop paying to play! we are gamers not investors!
1.0	"The graphics for this game are not as good  as people say. Mass effect 2 has the better graphics. Hated it, end of story. I don't know what's so special about this game? Although much
has been said about the high quality of graphics in this game. I totally disagree.  In reality, mass effect 2 has the better graphics.

I just didn't like this game! Junk"
1.0	Hey guys its yet another madden title. the same as 05? 04? 03? yep. EA makes the same crap over and over. ESPN sold better then Madden, last year becuase 1. it was a better game, also was rated higher in 75% of ratings. better graphics and acurate models. That is why they bought the licencse to the NFL. Beecuase if they didn't ESPN would sell better AGAIN this year. If EA sees failure, they find the quickest way out. They do not improve their game, they buy a license so that they do not have to improve their game. Pethetic. Madden is lame and EA is a retarded game maker. All EA games are bad, and cheap. Get ESPN 05 becuase its better then this lame title. Why spend 50$ on the EXACT same damn game as the other years? ANOTHER BAD EA GAME
1.0	I couldn't wait for this the release of this game. What a disappointment it positively, absolutely sucks! They have totally disabled the intergender matches! If you don't have it, don't get it! I am sending my copy back tonight! It deserves 0 stars! This Game Sucks
1.0	what a dog this machine when i play DVDS in it they freeze up about halfway through . the 3D capability is not true 3D it is 2D converted so it gives me a headache. where as my 3D blu ray player is true 3D and has no side effects. hooking your cable/ or satellite box up to it is redundent and the xbox 1 does not work as a dvr . so the only thing you can do witht his machine is play games. I wish i would have bought the ps4 What a dog.
1.0	"Im a big, big fan of horror and all the zombie movies from George A Romero so I was very excited when I bought this videogame. Its horrible its going to take you 10 or less minutes to realize that this game is very VERY BAD its a first person shooter with nothing to offer at all, the zombies don't die with a bullet in their heads I tought this was a George A Romero zombie movie they are suposed to die with a bullet in their head and it doesnt matter where you shoot them they die with 4 bullets anywhere you shoot them.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS VIDEOGAME BELIEVE ME. one of the  worst games I have ever played."

1.0	2 Items were missing, so I had to send it back. One Star
1.0	I ordered a white headset for my Xbox 360. I did not receive the correct color. No visual satisfaction for my console. Wrong color
1.0	It's like they made an Elder Scrolls game and removed all the good things about the Elder Scrolls, and they made an MMO  minus all the good interface and interaction of an MMO.  If anything this should be a free to play, waste of money for this product, but the story is dry, graphics are ok, not a lot of impact in combat or PvP.  They basically sacrificed having a good game trying to make it more immersive and failed.  Bethesda should of stuck to console ES. sadly a flop
1.0	"One of the worst, so called ""shooters"" I've ever played in my life. People have actually compared this game to Bioshock. LMAO!!! Bioshock DESTROYS this game in every way. Bioshock 1 is one of my favorite games of all time. The Prey from 2006 is way better than this too. This game is stunningly boring and frustrating. World is empty and dull. Glad I only spent 16 bucks on this and that wasn't worth the three hours of my life I'll never get back from this terrible game. Bioshock this is NOT!!!"
1.0	"I bought this game as a preorder [Full Version box set]. I went through the annoying system of creating a Battlenet account to play the Solo version of the game. For a long time I would play with no more hassles than the occasional server down time [makes a solo play part useless].

Well today Blizzard has REEVALUATED the product decieding it is a STARTER version ,and has removed Solo play alltogether. As well as haveing limits on Player vs Player play. All I need do is BUY another game to get access to what I PREORDED in the fist place.

Since they can make you pay AGAIN ,for what you bought when ever they deem I suggest you avoid ALL BLIZZARD games. How Things Change"

1.0	well i've had 3 of these things and they all fail with the RROD after just a few months they are alot of fun when they work but not worth having if you can not depend on them every day for at least a few years...i've had the same surround sound since 1997 and it still works great to this day...i know they can make dependable gear for us but it seems like the quality of the newer stuff is getting worse...I will always be a gamer but i'll never buy another Xbox 360...I have a stack of games that are usless now so i've wasted alot of money on things I can't use...i'm getting a PS3 here in the next week and I hope it lasts me longer than the 360's ever did.

1.0	The first xenosaga game's budget was at like 100%, and they put out a good game.  However, when it came to the this one, it's like they only got a 25% budget, and they cranked out a not so great game. Wasn't a good play for me

1.0	Gives players an unfair advantage in PvP Unfair
1.0	The clubs were often very empty, I hate the celebrity concept, and I just didn't really care for it. Apartments were alright at first, but as I like to play with families I couldn't stand their crampt size Other than for vampires, I stopped using it almost imediately
1.0	I've been playing this game for about 4 hours total. It's fun, but there's nothing new. It's Fallout 3 set in Vegas. But that's fine, it's what I expected and it's great when it works. Unfortunately, the bugs, glitches, and freezes are there too. To give you some idea of how bad this is, I just had to hard reset my PS3 three times in 20 minutes due to complete freezing of the game. Bethesda had so many chances to fix these glitches with Fallout 3 and didn't. Fallout 3 GOTY? Nope. I'm STUNNED that New Vegas is suffering from the exact same problems. Same game, same bugs, new locale
1.0	"If you liked halo 1 and halo 2 you might like this game because all it is is repeat of those games.  Better graphics, but the same game.  I would congratulate Microsoft in convincing all the teen fanboys to buy this garbage.  So how bad is the game?  Well let's put it this way, all the people who were so hot on buying the game a couple of months ago, no longer play it.  Yes, those same fanatics who pre-ordered the game don't play it anymore.  I played the game on the easist setting just to get through it but even then it was too boring.  And online play? Horrible.  Menu system?  Worse ever.

I would suggest that colleges teach about Halo 3 in their marketing classes.  To sell this dog turd at 60 bucks a pop is truly a great marketing accomplishment. Biggest rip off ever"
1.0	I had the product for 6 months and i don't know if it a manufacturer issue or a product issue but mine disconnects on its own after a few minutes on wireless. I didn't have this issue for the first 2 months and now it does it more than ever i would like to give it five star as it has alot of capabilities just wish I could use it more hope i can try there product once its improved. It has potential if its improved or it just me i don't know
1.0	I would love to purchase this game but sadly I will not be doing so. This game could have been great but is tainted with the stink of DRM (SecuROM) enforced limited installs. The DRM is a part of the game that you can't avoid if you install it so I must focus my review on the DRM. If you are a hardware enthusiast and change your hardware and reinstall your OS often as a lot do you will hit a wall very quickly with this type of DRM. Then you have to call them and hope that they believe you purchased the game in order to play. If they don't believe you I don't know what the procedure is but you probably won't be playing anytime soon. There has been talk of a system revocation tool for the end user but I haven't seen it and it would just be another hoop that they want you the legitimate customer to jump through and hope it works. I would recommend that everyone stop purchasing games with these limitations. The only people hurt by these limitations are the legitimate customers. Pirates will have the games from day one regardless. The game itself has been getting good press which makes me sad because the limiting DRM that it is saddled with will keep me from getting it. Luckily these days there are many other games out there to be had that don't force this DRM on the end user so I will be looking elsewhere. I'm not going to take it anymore...
1.0	"Well kids, I just returned the Xbox One my wife bought me after only a week of ownership. With the One being my first gaming console since the original Xbox I was in for a big shock.

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

I don't know if it's me not catching up with the times but it seems like games and consoles have gotten way over priced and you can share games like we used to. On top of that we have to now pay a membership fee to even use the games we ALREADY BOUGHT. This all seems like one big marketing ploy to me. I'm not standing for it so back to the store the Xbox went Take a stand against Microsoft!!"
1.0	"I would like to address the most malicious ones, though. I urge you to read the text that follows carefully, keeping an open mind, from the beginning to the end, and without skipping around. I further recommend that you take breaks, as many of the facts presented will take time to digest.

We must let Bungie know, in no uncertain terms, that it has done inestimable damage to everything around it. Those who claim otherwise do so only to justify their own contemptible conclusions. If we are powerless to make some changes here, it is because we have allowed Bungie to keep a close eye on those who look like they might think an unapproved thought. My vision that some day, people everywhere will say ""no"" to Bungie's irritating roorbacks is an inspiring dream. Unfortunately, reality always awakens me and reminds me that I've heard Bungie say that you and I are inferior to mindless lumpenproletariats. Was that just a slip of the lip or is Bungie secretly trying to render unspeakable and unthinkable whole categories of beliefs about power? The complete answer to that question is a long, sad story. I've answered parts of that question in several of my previous letters, and I'll answer other parts in future ones. For now, I'll just say that it has been said that those who think that it has the trappings of deity should think again. I, in turn, claim that it is doing everything in its power to make me abandon all hope. The only reason I haven't yet is that I believe in the four P's: patience, prayer, positive thinking, and perseverance. Lastly, for those who read this review, I hope you take it to heart and pass this message on to others.

gameplay- 0/5

sound- 1/5

graphics- 1/5

replay value- 0/5 To respond to all of Bungie's inveracities would take up too much room and time."
1.0	This game is just bad , If you really want this game get it on pc. It runs better on pc , the pc version also this gets updates. This game is just bad, If you really want this game get it ...
1.0	Great gaming system! One Star
1.0	"This product is advertised as brand new and unopened with the original seal. However, when I opened the game to play for the first time another save file was already there. The file's name was Karin-516. This is false advertisement. However, the game does boot up and comes with a manual and a case.

If this game is anything like it was on the home console, it is fun. It is much more challenging than Warlords and is much longer to finish.

Update

After playing the game for a couple of minutes, the voice acting(most of the story), is just an irritating noise. No words just a loud irritating gargle. The game display is really pixelated. I am unsure if this game is genuine or a copy.

Final Update

I got close to beating the game and the game, as I was playing, got corrupted and crashed. Good game awful seller and awful version"
1.0	I'll never buy another Steam game, NEVER NEVER NEVER.  It will simply not install from DVD on XP.  According to the web it used to, but it no longer works and forces you to download the entire 6 gig game.  Be prepared to wait for hours and hours for something you paid money for already (my download took 21 hours).  To enter the activation key (the easy part), you must do it manually via Steam (the setup program just disappears after you specify English Language; leaving no hint of even this first step).  What a horrible experience, even with a simple fast PC setup!  I'LL NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER BUY A STEAM GAME AGAIN!!!! Must download whole game, even with DVD
1.0	Waste of money. Also gave these away. I can see why discontinued. Material so soft that it wouldn't even slide in place to protect. I bought a hard cover made by Nintendo. Much better. Waste
1.0	DO NOT BUY!!! My grandson was sooo excited about getting this for Christmas. He is 15 years old. This was his first chirstmas since his mother's death so it was not any easy one for us all. I wanted him to have  the best Christmas he could have under the circumstance. Being left with 5 grandkids to raise alone, money was tight. This was the only thing I could get him for Christmas, but he was so excited because it was blue and had wanted one but did not want to ask for it.  I am upset it did not last even 7 months. Now I don't know how I am going to replace it. Hard drive does not last. This was his first chirstmas since his mother's death so it was not any easy one for us all
1.0	I can't play this game.  I would love to!  It just won't let me!  WTF have you done to this game EA/Marxis?  This is pathetic.  This game should be offline and single player.  What if I don't have internet access and I want to play this game?  I am requesting a refund.  Will never buy an always online game ever again. Worst Launch Ever!
1.0	I wanted to like this game, the story line is decent and the graphics are good but navigating the screens is painful. They have taken what could have been a good game and ruined it by not paying attention to some basic navigation problems. The cursor indicates that you can move in a direction by showing shoe prints when you hold the cursor over a hot spot. But in this game the hot spots are tiny or in a lot of cases missing. This makes something that should be simple, moving around the screens, very frustrating. In one screen after 5 minutes of searching I couldn't find any hot spots that would allow me to move forward into the market area, even though it was evident that it was where I needed to go. So I gave up and started randomly clicking in the screen, which eventually allowed me to move forward, but again, no hot spots to indicate where I could move to from that position. So more random clicking to try to get to one of the booths in the market. After having to do this to move several times the screen finally changed to show the market from a different angle and at that point I had navigational hot spots again. The tiny hot spots also caused a problem with figuring out what items I was supposed to pick up or look at. It caused me to miss several items in certain screens. And in a few cases the hot spot was completely off the item altogether, causing some confusion as to which item I was to pick up or look at. Another annoying problem was that often my character would stand right in front of what I needed to look at or touch. So I had to keep clicking the screen around her to try to move her out of the way in order to get to the item in question. So unless you have an infinite amount of time and patience, try some other game. Painful To Navigate
1.0	I play alot of the ATV games and this one just stunk! one thing: camera angle, BAD. I bought this games for a $1 at a store brand new, I understand why it was cheap because people kept on returnig it. so use your mouse and click on a differnt ATV game because this one is BAD!!!! This is the worst ATV game yet
1.0	Awesome One Star
1.0	The gameplay overall is solid but I usually spend most of my time in career modes. They ruined career mode to complete trash. They should have to pay you to play it. The whole time you are spent cringing at the dialogue wishing you would have just bought EA's game no matter how bad it could be. If you are looking for career DO NOT BUY THIS! Run if you want career
1.0	I tried the free preview of the game (which lasted a whole weekend) but it never lasted past the update screen before crashing. (My system is in great shape and beyond capable of running it, by the way, with parts made by mainstream manufacturers, and I have a broadband connection - so it was the game, not anything on my end.) I spent the weekend begging Turbine for advice on what I might do to actually play the game, on their site's forum, but got no replies. When the free weekend ended with out even getting to see a pixel of the game, I complained - while remaining civil - but got flamed from all sides and my topic was pulled from the board. Friendly community. =P That weekend was all the impression I needed to give me a sour enough distaste for DDO that I'll be hesitant to even give another free preview a try. You'd think I was playing an early beta version, as bad as it was, not the last preview before release. That doesn't bode well for the early days of this MMORPG. To those of you who plan on buying into it anyway: good luck. Cross your fingers when you get to the update screen. The screenshots are beautiful, though; too bad I wasn't allowed to see anything like them in motion. Maybe in a year or two I'll be willing to risk looking into DDO again, when/if they've managed to iron out some of the more basic bugs in the game. Meanwhile, I'll be playing Neverwinter Nights & NWN2 online (and not having to pay a monthly fee to do it.) Imagine how much better this game would be had it been made by Bioware.... Severe bugs, zero support
1.0	I personally wouldn't recommend this product to anybody. After about a week, one of the pedals stopped working. I use this to play on GTA and Need for Speed, but now it's useless because two of the buttons on the wheel and one of the pedals are not working. Trying to fix the problems is as frustrating as setting it up. I don't know, that's just my experience with the product. I am not proud of this product and it's sad i wasted my money on it. No! Just...No!
1.0	"No Lan.

This pretty much concludes why this gets a one star.  It is utterly ridiculous for this game not to have lan suppot.  And its not like they couldn't do it its that they intentionally left it out. Great Game Terrible Management Decisions"
1.0	"I've played the game for 3 months now, and overall I'm just disappointed. The only reason to play this game; it clearly has a large base of players for online multiplayer - including my family and friends. The negatives far outweigh that, however:

1st Player Gameplay
The story - as always for COD - is terrible. It's a hodge-podge of random events that happen for a string of characters that I have a hard enough time telling apart, let alone feeling emotion for. No redeeming value here.

Multiplayer
The multiplayer is very disorganized; most notably in how it ranks players. Unlike other games, any give player is placed in a game with both beginners, and expert players. The game refuses to rank games by skill, and the disparity of player ability is unbelievably frustrating.

Visual
Teams, opponents, scenery... it all looks the same. Granted, I am moderately color blind, but you can't tell you teammates from your foes until the ""gamertag"" floats above their body. The problem is, that notification above each player is both very difficult to differentiate, and very inconsistent in appearance (if someone runs around an object it often doesn't appear until they are well into the room).

System
Again, I've been playing for 3 months, however, each time I try to play with my friends (of which we have a group of about 6) we struggle to even get everyone in the same game. The UX is absolutely terrible. We cannot send game invites, we cannot setup parties, and we cannot communicate even after inviting all to a group.

1.0	"Are you joking. This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion. Man, are you guys even trying anymore?  I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh, you cant even make a good game out of that.
Man..bad graphics, horrible gameplay, sucky battle system, hard to understand, VERY difficult to get into it, too confusing, dumbxxx characters like cloud, hes the worst.(except sephiroth), sometimes too long of cutscenes, boring cutscenes, you can barely see their eyes & mouth, etc. etc. etc. etc. times a million.
I hate this game. Your joking..."
1.0	"Short and sweet, others have already said it well enough.

1. 3 activations, not a chance, and not with my money. Call EA? Yeah Ive been through that before, good luck.

2. Im finally tired of being considered a crook having been a legitimate customer of EAs for 15 years. You lost me my old standby publisher.

3. Pirates are laughing at this with glee. Look at what EA is doing to their own customers ha ha ha ha! What a business practice, cut off your nose to spite your face comes to mind. What marketing genius ran with this idea, and worse yet, what upper echelon idiot thought it was a good idea? :D :D Well it was pre-ordered then cancelled"
1.0	"This game was a HUGE disappointment to me, and a depressing experience considering how much I loved the Final Fantasy games up until this point.

Apart from this game's incredible art direction (the style and beauty of this game deserved better writing), FF13 is awful. Shockingly linear gameplay with nary a moment of exploration or wanderlust, annoying characters with minimal motivation for their actions, horrible pacing and nonsensical writing, and uninteresting combat and character customization are among this title's many sins. While the experience does improve after several hours, why would you want to bother unless you feel completely TRAPPED and OBLIGATED to play FF13 because you loved the other games?

Trust me: you do NOT want to encourage Square Enix's continuing entropy by supporting this title.

I've heard Japanese devs and journalists forgive this game by stating that you ""can't criticize FF from a western point-of-view"" and have also read them claim that linearity is required to form a compelling narrative. But, if this is the case, how come earlier FF titles weren't like this? FF7 had a great story, and yet had a load of content that lay off the beaten path. Golden Saucer, anyone?

The fact is that this is just a lazy, sloppy game by a once great company. Don't waste your time. A lazy and insipid effort put forward by a once great company."
1.0	One of these days I will learn to never buy a Logitech Gamepad. I keep thinking Logitech cares enough about their reputation that they would eventually fix a known problem. Obviously I am in error. Logitech's Gamepads continue to have D-Rings that fails after about 30 days use. This applies to all their models. As of now my right and up buttons require a great deal of pressure to activate. Soon they will fail completely. I now have to spend more money for a new 1. A shame really as their other products are quite good. just not their game pads. Logitech fails
1.0	"What a pain.  Talk about aggravation.  If you're like my family of four, we move from game to game to game pretty quickly.  We don't sit there and play the same game over and over.  So - - - unless you want to constantly be changing your remotes in and out of the accessories every single time you change games, not to mention we play all at once so we need to purchase 3 more sets so everyone has one - and you know how kids are - my turn, my turn, my turn; then this should not be purchased.  We all stand side by side and go from game to game to game.  When you have to stop and 3 people wait for one person to change out their accessory, well......I hope you get the idea.  It's a ""novelty item"" that wore off in 3 seconds.  I'm embarassed I did not think of these issues earlier.  It may be better if you are a solo player, but even if I played alone, I realy can't see myself stopping to change out the accessories.

The Wii remotes work just fine and do not need these ridiculous acccesories.  If you practice, you will figure out how to properly hold your remote and find the best way to use it - and sometimes its different from what the game suggests.

I can't review on how well the remotes stay in the accessories, and I can't comment on durability since we will never use them again.  They are already back in the box ready to be returned.  I'm just glad I bought them locally so I don't have to pay for shipping. Don't waste your time - unless you have a lot of time to waste."
1.0	"Same old horrible game.

I understand the need for EA to create a fast moving exciting game but when you're developing a game where you're competing with teams and players that are supposed to mirror am mimick the real professionals, a little realism would be great.

Strategy, ball control, poses sion and even accurate passing don't matter in this game. I've repeatedly dominated games with possession of over 80% and yet the AI is so bad that one of your defenders being controlled by the computer  will suddenly fall or stop running or lunge for the ball and allow an opponent to walk right into the goal. This type of play happens over and over rewarding luck and ruining the game.

I've tried very hard to like this game but I can actually predict when the computer is going to decide to make a ridiculous call, randomly give out a red card or give away a cheap goal. Simply put this is terrible. No better then any previous versions. I have up on fifa 14 for all of the same reasons and after downloading the demo I can say unequivocally this is no better.  I'm just very grateful I didn't actually purchase it.

Do yourself a favor and save your money. Take a pass on this horrible franchise and company Save Your Money!!!"
1.0	"There is no way in any acid fueled mind trip that this game deserves a 5 star rating.  The play is painfully slow, the player conversation is inane and repetitive after just a few rounds, and there is no multiplayer.

The only reason to play this game would be for the unlock-able downloads, other than that there is nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing redeamable about this mind-numbingly turgid mess that would justify playing it, not even if it was free. Painful game, bogus reviews"
1.0	"I really should enjoy this game.  I'm a huge fan of brawlers, and enjoy even the worst-reviewed beat-em-up games out there.  Games like Streets of Rage, Captain Commando and Golden Axe are some of my favorite games of all time (and I play an awful, awful lot of games!).  I also love Sega products, particularly their arcade games.  I love the hardware they ran on, I love the graphics, and I love their quirky attitude.

But Spikeout just simply sucks on the Xbox.  The first thing you will be forced to note is the eternal loading time.  The game employs horrifyingly stupid CG cutscenes while the game loads to make the wait seem shorter, but it backfires and makes the whole experience awful.  In addition to the load times being excessively long...the game loads all the time.  You might literally play for three minutes, and then have to load for another minute or two, only to play a 2 minute section, then load for a minute.  It's really badly programmed.

And the game itself is really a poor brawler.  The graphics are pretty darn good, particularly for the game's age...but the camera angles suck, the enemy AI sucks, the combo system is horribly weak, the controls are not intuitive, the special weapons are stupid, the stages are much more repetetive than even most brawlers, and the characters are even more boring than expected from a game featuring a break-dancer named Spike Jr. as its main character.

And that's as much time as I'm going to spend warning you not to even waste the current going price of $15 on this one.  It's terrible, just plain out not worth playing no matter what your tastes are like, don't even think about it. A complete failure"
1.0	"Lionhead is a dying beast. Fable 2 and 3 were jokes. I thought ""at least they can't mess up the original Fable. It was one of the best games ever made."" Wrong! This game crashes every 15-30 minutes, making it virtually impossible to play. We were promised a fix back in February. Two months later and it's the same crap. Don't waste your time and money on these hacks. Go pick up Kingdoms of Amalur for similar visuals to Fable, or better yet, go pick up an Elder Scrolls game. Or go bang your head against the wall. It's less frustrating. Crashes! Can't play!"
1.0	"I'm really done with Ubisoft's Just Dance series.  We had 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and Disney on Xbox 360 and *loved* them all.  But since the jump to the current generation, beginning with Just Dance 2016, Ubisoft has decided that even if you pay $50 for their game, you still can't really play it.

In older editions, you buy the game.  No strings were attached, you could just play and play.  If you wanted to pick up additional tracks, you just purchased them as DLC (individually or in a bundle) and play some more.  In Just Dance 2017 there is no DLC, which you would think is good.  Instead, you have to purchase a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JD-Unlimited/dp/B0189VJSUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JD Unlimited</a>&nbsp;music pass for $40 a year.  As soon as it expires, your music is gone.  You own nothing.

Furthermore, even some of the songs that are included with the game (that you *paid* for!), are not available unless you sign up for Ubisoft's Uplay.  Create an account, get to play the game you already paid for.  Why?  So they can market to you and sell your information (check those terms of service).

So buy a game for which you have to keep paying for the privilege of using, and join something you don't won't for the privilege of playing the game you bought?  No.  Draw your line here - it's not worth it. Gets worse and worse"
1.0	"This review is not for the Retrolink controller but for the controller you will actually receive if you try to purchase from this product page.  The controller you will receive is a cheap, crappy Chinese knock off.  It has terrible feel, cheap plastic, and hinged shoulder buttons that barely work.  It is awful, don't waste your money.  The real Retrolink controller is of much higher quality.  I highly recommend genuine Retrolink products.  This controller, however, is not one of them.

The worst part for me is that I realized that the item was counterfeit a few years after I ordered it and Amazon said it was too late to do a return.  I had to argue and plead and demand that they reopen my case and I am still trying to get my money back from the shady seller, VPGames, who would not even return my emails.  Very disappointed. Counterfeit, not Retrolink"
1.0	no game case One Star
1.0	"This game is so popular only because of advertisement. Just think about these facts: the single player is so short that it take no longer than 4 hours, and the story is extremely stupid, especially the ending when there is nuclear explosion, and our hero flyes out of there on helecopter!!!

 The multiplayer is one of the worst FPS multiplayers. Coupal weapons, similar maps, same skins and few stupid mods.

 The ONLY thing about this game is its graphics, but they ain't looking SO good, it just will be VERY laggy, unless you have the BEST video card.

 +It is secured by securom, which means if you have ANY cd-emulators installed, this game WILL NOT WORK.

 Will say something like ""security modul cannot be activated"". If you ever had this problem with any games, you definitely will have it here. It's not what you're thinking"
1.0	This keyboard was cool if it would just work. It randomly assigns keys to do whatever functions it sees fit in the middle of playing games. I will have to unplug the keyboard or sometimes restart the entire system just to fix the problem. I don't know why this happens. I don't even have any special macro functions set up I just use it as a normal keyboard. This problem pretty much makes this keyboard useless seeing as how it happens at least once a day. Worst keyboard ever.....
1.0	I hated the controls and the game was super boring! Traded it the day after I got it! One Star
1.0	"No online game has ever made me care about every single quest as much as ESO has. Unfortunately, no other online game has ever given other players as much power to ruin my questing experience as ESO has either.

The voice acting is magnificently done, and even when the story is weak, the ambient and the interpretation of that story still pull you in and make you feel engaged. However, the developers choice to force nearly everything into a public dungeon ruins everything. Its standard to engage on an immersive quest only to find yourself sneaking through a sewer while waves of other players rush by you and jump your boss encounter, killing him and completing the quest for you.

Most quests are in such public areas and there is no way around it: you will be rushing through them to at least feel you lied a finger on that boss.

On the other hand, there ARE some quest lines that are entirely private. These are ok, however they suffer the entirely opposite problem: you cant ever group them. I'm not talking about strangers now, I'm talking about you and a friend engaging together into these quests. Each one of you will be forced to do things on their own and rejoin later.

And finally, a system  (arguably great)  that changes the world based on your quest progress means even in public areas, you may not be able to group with your friends but still see strangers poking around your experience. This is because the technology that ""changes the world"" works like a curtain, one that falls in between your teammates and you unless both happen to be in the exact same quest.

Again, the game has a great atmosphere, fantastic reenactment of quest, and extremely fun combat system. However, it arbitrarily jumps between forcing you to solo and making you play with strangers in a rush while preventing you to group with friends. Bittersweet game, many magnificent things crippled by few fatal design choices."
1.0	This game is not even good for a turtle fan! I'm sure a kid would enjoy it though. I guess if I want to play a TMNT game I'll stick with the NES Very sad
1.0	"I purchased this game based on the idea of racing with different scenery, with different cars.  A more laid back racing and whole new racing experience, that had so much potential.

When you first play the game, only one track is available and one car.  The others must be unlocked.  The first track is IMPOSSIBLE!  I tried with the wheel, I tried without.  I kept slamming into the side of the cliff.  The graphics were fantastic, typical of Wii but fun, and different.  I have owned 4 other Wii racing games, and no other game had so much difficulty with controlling.

If you want an affordable, good racing game with better control, I highly recommend GT Pro Series. Great idea, bad game."
1.0	this has to be  by far the worst gamecube game ever made a piece of #@&?
1.0	"I'm not under the delusion that blizzard won't make a ton of money on this game, they've become a megalithic game company for a reason.

Requiring the internet to play, removing lan plan and all the other things they are forcing people to put up with in order to play their games is a sure way to bring them down from the clouds however.

I'm not buying it, nor its drawn-out future expansion campaigns designed solely to make more bank, and the same seems to hold true for the release of Diablo$ either. No thanks"
1.0	"WOW...I thought games this bad were a thing of the past! And they actually want $35-40 for this piece of garbage too!!!!

This game is not worth spending much time on so let me be short.

Graphics are rough and crappy even on a high end system. The missions are dull, the enemy AI is TERRIBLE, the aiming/gun siting system is terrible. You spend way too much time trying to setup effective kill shot and by then the half brain dead enemies move any way!

This game is unchallenging, uninspired and is a total disappointment. Tons of cut-scenes that eat up way too much time, no substance. I cannot believe websites like Gamespot actually rated this as a 7.5(GOOD)!!!!!

This is a first person shooter that makes you feel like your character is covered in molasses because all responses and movements are slow and frustrating even after you adjust settings in options. Aiming is a nightmare. The battles are more of an exercise in learning how NOT to make a game than being about fun or entertainment.

Trust me...download the demo (if there is one) and play this fully before you burn your money on this piece of trash that is lower than seagull crap in my opinion.

By the way, if you go to Activision's website to check out this game (GET THIS!!!) They actually want you to type in your birthdate and they request a valid CREDIT CARD # to validate that you are an adult due to the mature nature of this game...LOL  LOL LOL LOL...yeah right! Like I am really going to give those morons my credit card info. Even if this game was a 10 star rating I would not do that! What idiots! Abysmal, Horrible, Lame, Pathetic and Dull"

1.0	"Update 2: The second NES controller I got under warranty didn't work the first time I tried using it. I'm starting to think the Player 1 controller port is shorted out. Don't waste your time or money!

Update: After about two weeks worth of casual play of Final Fantasy I (very low stress), the controller developed a short in the cord and I had to exchange it. It was annoying and who knows how long it will last this time?

Cons:
Flimsy-seeming
Games flop around in console
Controller cords are short
Included A/V cables are short
SNES ejector doesn't work

Pros:
Plays all my games!
Crisp, clean graphics
S-Video and Composite A/V ports
Crisp new controllers (almost identical to the originals)!
Looks almost like an SNES in your game cabinet!
You get to say its cool name and explain it to people when they ask why your SNES looks odd

The details:
SNES/NES selector switch looks like the original SNES power switch, so everyone rams and jams it before noticing the power buttons!
It brought back all my old childhood memories and replaced my recently dead SNES. I've been very happy with it thus far, despite the few nagging, and potentially big in the future, problems listed above.
The console itself is very lightweight and feels sort of flimsy, but out of the corner of your eye, looks just like an SNES. The SNES cartridge ejector won't work on its own because the lever is so floppy you have to pull up on the cartridge as you push down on the ejector. The slots for the games are wide and the games are able to flop around in the console (especially the NES port...there's about a 1/16"" of an inch air gap on both sides) to the point that if you bump your coffee table or someone walks by heavily, they'll wobble. Then your game freezes. Then you're super un-zen. The actual ports for the games on the circuit board don't feel very sturdy my roommate went to push in an SNES game with the usual zeal of a child and it made a horrible creaking noise. You have to push them in gently and they only sink a little, so it may seem like they're not seated (but trust me, they are). Will these ports wear out and come loose off the circuit board after many cartridge insertions/removals? Or snap off if a game is bumped, in the case of the NES port?
The games look perfect and crisp better than they ever did on my official consoles! Everyone remarks about how good it all looks, too, when they sit down to play.
The only output is composite A/V or S-Video, which will be fine for most people.
The controllers are lightweight, but crisp. They are identical to the originals and even have the same good points (SNES ""B"" response sensitivity) and not-so-good points (NES D-Pad that sometimes turns you left for no reason if you don't hit it just right). You don't have to deal with those goofy-looking controllers all the other reproduction consoles have!
Perhaps it's the fact that my SNES controllers are so old that when you jump in Super Mario World, they creak, that makes these new ones seem so great. It was amazing feeling those smooth button presses. Of course, I promptly spilled beer in my new controller...and had to go back to my ancient SNES ones.
The cords are a mite short. I have a pretty big living room, so this may not be a fair comment, but I have to pull the console out away from the TV to the coffee table unless I use the original SNES cords. The power cord is decently long, but the included A/V cables are also short. I had longer ones laying around.
Controller ports are on the sides of the console, not the front like the NES/SNES, and while it may look a little odd at first, I'm assuming they did it like that for design efficiency, so both the SNES and NES boards could access the ports in the middle without running a bunch of extra PCB or wiring to the front!
NES games only seem to work with minor wiggling/reinsertion.
All of the cheapiness aside, it plays all my SNES games flawlessly. My girlfriend and I just got *96 on Super Mario world. The guy at the game store I bought it from warned me that it was tricky with certain cartridges, especially ones that had ""FX"" or something? He specifically said it won't work with Mario RPG.

So far, I have confirmed it to work with:
Super Mario World
Super Mario All-Stars
SimCity
Batman Returns
Donky Kong Country 3: Dixie's Double Trouble
Super Return of the Jedi (though at the end of every level it locks up and you have to reset the system and enter the code to advance not sure if it's the cartridge or the system)
Justice League
Top Gear
Megaman Soccer
Kirby Super Star
Final Fight
Drakken
I couldn't find any Gameboy games to test my Super Gameboy...will update if they ever turn up.

For NES:
Duck Hunt, but only with wiggling. Everything seems to work, but the game doesn't register my gun shots. I'm going to assume it's because I have an LED HDTV!
The Legend of Zelda (Gold), but only with some wiggling.
Final Fantasy, but only if I take the game out and reinsert it everytime I start it up for some reason...
*I have the Adventure of Link, but it's pristine in its box, so I didn't open it to test. If I do in the future, I'll update this!

*Note: The clerk at the independent game store I got it from said that the Retron 3 is known to play more games but he might have been trying to upsell me. As I don't have any desire to play Genesis games and it comes with really dumb-looking Sega-esque wireless controllers, I didn't bother to spend the extra $20 on it!

All in all...it's been an awesome experience that has provided, literally, days of fun. I worry about the longevity of the console. The cheapiness I've gotten over in lieu of how much fun I've been having. I love the feel of turning it on and gaming away! As cheaply made as it looks NES controller (and replacement) broken after less than a month."
1.0	I really wanted to play this game, however, it doesn't want to run under windows 7.  I've tried various fixes that were suggested on the web, but I can't ever get past the load screen after the principle's office.  The text file suggests that the game is compatible with Windows XP and Vista, but putting the game into either of those run modes does not help.  Changing the max memory of the computer through config to 2048 also doesn't work.  Selecting Vista as a compatibility mode does allow the forum suggested affinity 0 cpu mod, but this merely slows the game down and it still doesn't get past the load screen.  I can duplicate the load screen error by going in and out of the building, and eventually it will get into the load screen loop.  The game will always get into the load screen loop after the first priciple's office.  My machine is running up to date video drivers, .net 4 with 3.5.1 compatibility enabled.  The xbox controller did work which was nice, and got me hopeful, but the game is unplayable. I really wanted to play this game...
1.0	This game could have been so much more.  The hack and slash action is not even fun, it just get's tedious and boring.  I have to admit the graphic's are spectacular, but that does not make this a great game.  Rune contains lot's of jumping from object to object, which will get boring after they first introduce it into the game.  The game also had no depth whatsoever.  I never just want to play it for fun, because I felt there almost is no fun in this game.  In my opinion, if you are going to get a hack and slash action game GET BLADE OF DARKNESS. BORING

The night I bought this I played for and hour trying to get into it, but it was just boring, i was so excited to play it because everyone had been pumping it up and giving it great reviews, but to my dissapointment, it was really bad. What is wrong with these games now a days? They're all the same, nothing is stand out or extremely original. GRAW exceeds way above this game and Gear of War won game of the year? I have no idea how, the graphics are nice but overall the gameplay is dull and its just a boring game, after one night, i took it to the neighborhood eb games and traded it for store credit, that was the fastest ive ever gotten rid of a game, if your gonna buy it, wait until its 20 dollars then it might be worth it.

1.0	"Some reader reviews said the game is better but you have to play most into the game to know which it is so bad. Simply playing it for a few hours don't tell you the real story.

Did Sillicon Knight got a group of artists but forgot to make the game? The graphics look very nice, and force you watch unskippable the death scenes over and over. Every few steps, the game throws at you tons of enemies non-stop. Most levels look and play alike like the game developers simply copy and paste the same level repeatly. There are only a few lines recorded for your squard and the same lines got repeating over and over. Your squard random disappears but they are still talking. There is no way to adjust the audio in the game (the audio option doesn't even exist). The explosions are ultra loud which is played continuously. There are so many stupid things in this game to point it's not even a game but rather the artists want to force you to watch their art than playing the game.

Too Human looks very promising on the surface and the more your play the game, the more pointless and boring it becomes. Buggy and ""copy and paste"" mindless of levels with samething over and over"

1.0	"I've had an original PSP-1000 since it came out a few years back.  I never really needed to move into a new model because of the reliability.

Over the course of the past month, I lost my home charger in a recent move, so I decided that $12 was okay to spend on a new one.

I attached the new charger into the wall and plugged the PSP in, and the little light came on signaling the charge.  I walked away to go get some things done.

I check on the PSP an hour later and the light was off.  Odd, it usually glows green.

I unplugged the PSP and tried to turn it on.  Nothing.  This new charger completely fried my PSP.  Buyers beware, this thing destroyed the battery AND the insides.

Alas, I went out and bought a PSP-3000.  Just be careful with this.  I've seen nothing but great reviews, and yet I lost a great device. I cannot believe this."

Pros: Graphics, Improved Climbing Mechanics

Cons: Bad Combat System,Counter attacks way more complicated then they should be, Constant Bugs/Glitches, Frame Rate crashes. Story jumps all over not put together right

Solution: I did the update nothing has changed taking this POS back to the store what a waste of money and time. WTF Was Ubisoft Thinking"

1.0	"While making creatures is fun, what you can do with your creature is quite limited. This is nothing more than a small demo of the game. I don't recommend people paying for this and I am kind of upset it is being sold in the first place.

Download and try the free trial version off the official game site. It is stripped down so you have limited body parts and what not, but is essentially the same, and if you only spend 15 minutes messing around and feel like you've had enough you won't have wasted ten bucks. Demo for sale"
1.0	First off, I am a huge AC fan...been one since the beginning. I have to say that this game doesn't interest me at all. The theme is pretty cool, not going to lie, but half the gameplay is on a ship, REALLY NOW??? An assassin doesn't sit on a ship blowing up other ones. I just feel Ubisoft lost their way. They just haven't been the same since Ezio... no no nooo
1.0	THIS is a $5 game, BATMAN VR is a $20 game, THIS is not. This looks like a highschooler made it. Decent game for $5, HORRIBLE game for $20 or more compared to what else is available. shame...SHAME! Horrible game at a horrible price.

1.0	I had high expectations for this game.  I played the single player demo and the multiplayer demo - both worked fine on my nearly brand new system (P4-3Ghz - 1GB Ram, Radeon 9600XT 256MB, XP SP2).  However, I installed my purchased copy, only to encounter some Firewall VBscript error at the end of installation, and then when attempting to play the game, it cannot find the installation CD1 disk.  I attempted to install the game on my second PC and encountered the same error.  So, I returned my copy to Amazon and requested an exchange for another copy since I suspected maybe the disk was damaged.  I received my 2nd copy only 2 days later (great return process Amazon!), reinstalled the game, and again had the same error.  I have a Lite-On LDW-851S DVD/CD-RW combo drive and updated the firmware per information I found on the EA site, but that didn't resolve anything.  I haven't had any other compatibility problems with other games (ex UT2004) and this drive, or with the drive itself so it must be something with the game.  I guess I'll have to go back to Call Of Duty for my WWII genre action gaming. Cannot locate the cd-rom?
1.0	"An old Ross Perot quote pretty much sums up this game: ""You're going to hear a giant sucking noise"" as you play this game.  Whoo, baby, does this game stink!  I thought that 'The Crystal Key II' (another recent Dreamcatcher/Adventure Company game) was pretty awful, but I did not know there was a whole other level of bad below that!  Holy cow, how does dreck like this manage to get published with such flashy and professional packaging and marketing?
Jeez, where to start?  How about with the incredibly bad interface.  The game is a standard point-and-click adventure game where you navigate from point to point and then pan around in 360 degree views.  Panning requires you to hold down the left mouse button while dragging the mouse in the direction you want to pan.  What is so awful about this interface is that when you have dragged your mouse the entire width of your mousepad, you have only panned about one quarter of way around the view.  You then have to lift and reposition your mouse to drag it some more in the direction you are panning!  Most games have an option to correct this by letting you set the mouse sensitivity to a speed that you (and your video card) are comfortable with.  Is that option available here? NO! Can you pan with your keyboard instead? NO! As a matter of fact there are absolutely NO games options whatsoever!  You are stuck with one panning rate, one music volume, one dialog volume (a real shame since the dialog is putrid), and...you get the picture.
Getting an item into your inventory is pretty easy (just click on it), but getting it out is absolutely painful.  You first have to click on a screen icon to pull up your inventory list, click on an item to see a larger view of it in the middle of your screen, click on that large image to change your cursor into a representation of that item, and then click on the exit button of the inventory screen.  Finally you then have to click on the game spot where you think the item might be useful.  Unfortunately, you typically have no clue as to what might work at a specific hot spot, so you end up trying EVERYTHING in your inventory to see if something works (and there is a lot of junk in there sometimes)!
The puzzles of the game are a joke.  As a matter of fact, the very first two puzzles you encounter are pretty much the same thing: try to find the correct sequence of clicks to get all the way through the puzzle; if you guess wrong, start over!  They don't get much more imaginative beyond that.  My game came with a ""limited edition"" game strategy guide included free.  I'm guessing that all of them will come with this guide because, otherwise, nobody will be able to (nor want to) finish this embarrassment.
As a final insult, the developers thought they would try to spice up their incoherent game by adding a lot of humor.  Done well, humor can add a very entertaining aspect to an adventure game.  The classic Zork games are excellent examples.  When done badly, as in this case, it just becomes irritating to the point of distraction.  Most of it is just not funny (okay, maybe to a six year old) and does not ""fit"" in the atmosphere of this game.  Jive talking jungle natives?  Please.
Again, like Crystal Key II, this looks like the work of an independent game developer who has spent years putting together a workable game using ""knives and bearskins"".  If so, I would have admired the work and enjoyed the game for what it was.  Unfortunately, this game was, again, developed by what looks to be a large team (Hexagon).  Games like these give the game genre, which I love the most, a huge black eye and are probably the reason why so many people get turned off by adventure games.  What a shame, because there are some really good ones out there.  Unfortunately, you have to dig through a lot of dung like this to find it.  Avoid this game. Don't let the packaging fool you!"
1.0	Okay is this a April fools joke this game is terrible mortal kombat in 3D what were they thinking this game is bad really bad mk4 in 3D that just puts the other ones to shame. so midway check your mk games before bringing them out because this game just sucks don't even buy it i don't recommend it to any mk fan the controls are terrible so i could go on but theres so much wrong with this game that's why i gave it 1 stars don't even buy this game it's a pour excuse of a mk game i can't believe midway would bring it out

1.0	This game has very little to recommend it (although it is only [...]). The graphics are ho-hum, there's no in-car perspective (the best it can do is a hood-cam view), and the tracks are generally boring (except for the classic Nordschleife). There is a very wide selection of cars available, but most of them do not drive realistically (e.g., an inordinate amount of wheelspin sometimes, gear ratios that do not reflect reality, and features that the actual cars do not have). An aspect of this game that has been promoted is the ability to separately upgrade and tune each car. Sounds like a great idea, but it is poorly implemented here (e.g., what you do to the car and the resulting change in performance do not match). Bottom line: there is not a good console-based driving sim available; FM2 is arcade-like, much in line with competing titles. Unrealistic arcade-like driving game
1.0	Am I the only one that misses Capt. Price and Soap? In my opinion COD peaked with MW1 & MW2. This futuristic flying ninja crap is ridiculous for true COD fans like me. Unless they go back to their roots, they've lost my futuristic hard earned money! Hell, they could even do my war..Viet Nam. They've barely touched that war and it lasted over 10 years. Come back Capt Price!!! Soap! Soap!....We need you back!

1.0	For starters, this is my brother's game, but I tried it out for like, fifteen minutes, before I got so bored I turned it off. This game is a pointless shoot 'em up where all you do is run around shooting this or sawing that. It's entertaining for a little bit watching the zombies fall apart at the hands(or blades) of Ash's chainsaw. But it's only a matter of time before the gameplay becomes so redundant you have no will to continue playing because all you do is chop stuff up(and what's with the strip clubs everywhere?!).There ARE spells that attempt to add some depth to the game, but when the day is over, you're left with the same shoot and slash garbage you started with when you turned the game on. Anyone into these kind of games should check out the Hunter games instead. They have better variation in weapons, and you can play with a friend. I would not recommend this game to ANYONE unless they're a die hard fan of the Evil Dead series. senseless garbage

1.0	"Sacred 3 is nothing like Sacred 2... Best I can say its like Diablo 3 and such games. I was really worried about series after Sacred Citadel came out and they have proven this series has gone down the drain i DO NOT recommend buying this.

Decided to go a little moe into detail on this day after.  If you are looking for another Sacred or Sacred 2 this game IS NOT it.  If you think of this game as a Guantlet type game you may enjoy it.

There are no weapon/equipment drops like in previous Sacred games.  you can still get gold drops though. No open world almost forgot to post that as well Sacred 3 is nothing like Sacred 2"

1.0	"This game is like your first serious relationship.  You think that it's true love, that it's ""the one,"" and that it will never end.  Over time, things slowly change.  A new haircut, new clothes, new group of friends, etc.  The changes are slow, incremental.  Each change is only slight enough that you notice it, but the familiarity is still there.  You have your fights, things are said, mistakes are made (Ghosts), but you are committed and you stick with it.  Then, one day, you're in the middle of your routine and you realize that the relationship is over.  Your significant other has changed so much that they are unrecognizable.  That's what's happened here.

COD slowly lost the plot through previous years.  They've kept all the weird changes and updates from old editions, just layering them on top of each other.  This is so far from the fundamentals that made it great that I would not have been able to recognize it as a COD title but for ""CALL OF DUTY"" being slapped on the cover.

You can make your own class, but then you have mech armor/suits layered on top of that.  There are some strange choices in the tactical grenade menu.  They've kept that weapon/item that charges throughout the round.  Then my personal pet peeve, the jumping/jet pack and wall running, is still in the game.  They have now completed the transition from a solid, fundamental FPS to the dudebro, Dorito and Mountain Dew choice of 12 year olds everywhere.  This is ADHD in video game form.

The only redeeming quality about this game is the Legacy Edition came with one of the best COD titles and multiplayer ability.  Even then, Activision won't let me sell off the IW disc if I still want to play MW.  I guess I will have to come to terms with the fact that I paid $70.00 for a remastered Modern Warfare and got a cheap Halo knockoff  included.  The remastered Modern Warfare is the only reason why I can give this a star (and the fact that Amazon does not allow a zero star review). This game is like your first serious relationship"
1.0	"I bought this game at gamestop so i thought that i come to amazing to give my review since i am on this site most of the time. First off the Maps, They are so big that they promote camping and getting shot at the back and it gets annoying. This game is so boring i almost fell asleep playing it, if i wanted a battlefield game i would buy it. But for some reason they thought it was cool to map the game like battlefield, but it backfired because the game feels broken, Its like a kids version of battlefield. So if you are 10 years old, you would love this game to death. But if you are a Man/Woman you will get annoyed and most likely hate yourself for buying it. Thanks for reading my review.

Have a Great day ;D This game is like the kids version of battlefield."

His objective is to collect items and gems and trade them for hearts needed to complete the game. The game is relatively boring, especially whenever your constantly going back and forth between two worlds to open chest or return items you you've found. There is almost no storyline, as with most Spyro games. Attack of the Rhynocs
1.0	resets the Xbox when switching inputs! really disappointed,could have spent 1/3 of what this cost to get that, really expected better from Turtle Beach don't buy
1.0	I had bought this game thinking it was like any other adventure game--confusing in some spots, but eventually SOLVABLE. But I found the three little arcade games extremely frustrating and if I hadn't gotten a save for just after the third puzzle I may not have been able to solve this game at all. It wouldn't have been so bad if they hadn't made the puzzles so ridiculously hard requiring you to make your move within nanoseconds. There are some other spots that require you to act quickly so that instead of just enjoying the game and the neat graphics and such I was just tense and nervous instead. I buy adventure games because I absolutely hate the action and timed games and I want to get wrapped up in the story without having to worry about time. Mixing adventure with action is not a good idea. If all the adventure games start doing this, they'll lose me and I'm sure other people as customers. Adventure games are supposed to be fun and intriguing, not leaving you frustrated with no more hair left on your head. That said, I actually found it to be an interesting story line and the different scenes were well done. The English translation was a little kooky and sounded stilted at times, but the message got across. I found some of the actions needed were a little unbelievable. Adam, the hero, is a bit of a weakly wimp. It was as if some of the tasks were to be done only to take up more game time. If you like action mixed with adventure then you might find this game enjoyable but if you're a die-hard adventure-only fan like me then don't buy it--you might lose your voice from screaming at the computer all day. Not what I expected......
1.0	Let me just say that I'm a HUGE Zelda fan.  And in reality, this is probably a very good game.  Unfortunately, I'm not able to enjoy what would be a very fun game because of the idiotic controls Nintendo insists we use to control the game.  Nintendo seems more intent on showing what 'can' be done, as opposed to what 'should' be done.  Nothing is more frustrating than wanting to play the game, and having a directional control pad RIGHT THERE, and not being able to move your character with it.  Nope. they want to show off their touch screen and have you move your character by touching and sliding a stylus across the screen.  Sorry Nintendo, that's like trying to read braille when you can actually see.  It's totally backwards and makes playing the game much too awkward and not fun at all.  It's the same thing they did with the Wii in making you actually have to swing around your remote to try and fight enemies instead of just pushing a button.  It's just showing off features instead of actually making the game where it would be easier to play.  I tried it for about three minutes, and got so frustrated that the game went into the trash.  Thank god they learned their lesson for the new Link Between Worlds and went back to the way the game was meant to be played.  I mean if they want to have this feature...fine, but also give us the option to using normal controls.  But nope, they give us no choice.  Just because the system has a touch screen and stylus, that doesn't mean you have to make those features the main way to control this type of game.  So potential buyers...be aware.  this is probably actually a nice game, but unfortunately the designers forced us to play it in a way that didn't allow us to actually enjoy the game. Totally Useless!
1.0	Give us only one large console which i don't want start playing more exlusive games. I just got into nintendo games. I usally play xbox one and i see that nintendo is no better then the two consoles system. They really expect everyone to want the huge 3ds and spend over 200 dollars just to play this game. Screw that i was gonna get and old 3ds but seeing this confirmed that im not. Really
1.0	Just like everyone else I can go ahead and complain about all changes done to this game. You know what, I won't even bother writing about that. Granted, they made MAJOR changes on all aspects of the game and some people will like it or hate it. What gets me is the fact that you have to be online to even play the game SOLO. This is an abuse from the publisher and a sign of total disrespect to their consumers. Do yourself a favor and get this game from somewhere else. Paying for it won't be worth your time.

1.0	"Str8 Trash, The graphics are so horrible & the gameplay is so un-inspiring that I sent it right back to game fly after playing for just 1 hour(maybe less). I cant even believe this is getting high ratings, thats laughable, 5 Stars??? Really?, seriously?? Why??, its beyond me. The graphics were a turn off from the very get go I had already giving it a 3 Stars then more and more factors started to lower its already bad rating, This is not a good first impression, these graphics are not acceptable, especially not a Xbox360 Game, it doesnt get much worse than this & thats going all the way back to Nintendo(the very 1st one). I cant judge the story cause like I said I didnt/couldnt finish playing but The Gaming is simple, its boring, controls- frustrating & the graphics are so awful to the point where I got nausea & head-aches just from playing, I mean im getting sick all over again hearing/seeing that PPL wanna call these Graphics ""Amazing"", go play Heavy Rain or Uncharted 2 sweetie and compare it to this Rubbish. This is so over-rated. I could say it one thousand times: over-rated, over-rated, over-rated. Im gonna Stop here, This game doesnt deserve a long review anyway, 1 Star, actually a 0.

& I just found out that they're releasing a Arkham Asylum 2 soon, hopefully they took a hint. Heres hoping the 2nd installment will raise the Bar. No Ma'am Whos rating This??"
1.0	This game looks weird without Mario. Besides your doing what wario allways does. Stealing treasure. I bet this will be hard. Why cant we play as a good guy?
1.0	"I'm in pain...not physical pain, but I'm hurt from actually playing these Back to the Future games. Plus, they are by LJN (except the Genesis BTTF3), so that can only mean a bad thing. The first BTTF game was a monstrosity in which you play as someone who is supposed to represent Marty, but doesn't look like him, shooting bowling balls, collecting clocks, and dodging bullies and hula-hoop girls.

Back to the Future 2 & 3 (not a game collection by the way, just to let you know) is better in some ways, but way worse in others. On one hand, the overused background music here sounds way better than that 1 and a half second loop of the first game's music. The game also plays better, as it's a hybrid of Mario and Metroid exploration/platforming.

On the other hand, the music is still overused, not making the game seem too great to begin with. And while the game does provide nice platforming, it fails on every bit of exploration. It is never easy to navigate yourself through all of these levels to find the items you need. You're supposed to send the items back to their time periods, but along the way, you'll have to find keys that open doors to items, play crappy bonus stages before reaching the items, unscramble words (Seriously? That's desperate...), and explore frustratingly throughout the game. And take notice that there are 30 items.

So, after explaining all of the basic things you have to do as you play the game, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want to play the game. Even if you're a fan of exploration games like Metroid or Zelda, I may as well say good luck trying to find your way out of this unforgiving maze. Oh, yeah! There's no save or password feature either.

Buying this game is like buying a Wii box full of sand on ebay (Not expecting it to be full of sand). You are expecting something amazing, but then you end up getting gypped. Just because it's a platformer doesn't mean it's any better."
1.0	"This is frankly the worst game I have ever played.  Anyone who gives this higher than 2 stars has either: a)never played the pc version, b)played with a USB game controller, or c)only played the console versions (PS2, Gamecube, etc.).

This is a classic example of a console game that was ported by a low-budget Japanese company to the PC in order to bring in more dollars.  There is absolutely no mouse support outside of a 3rd party mouse-hack, which only makes aiming slightly better.  When gamers like myself have to turn to other gamers to make the controls better, it is a pathetic game to start with.

The ""minimum system requirements"" are far to low to even come close to playing the game in the lowest detail/resolution.  Even their recommended system requirements might not be able to play the game in full detail.

The graphics are good but there is no ""wow-effect"" when it comes to textures during normal gameplay.  The cutscenes are poor 640x480 resolution with no lighting effects whatsoever and short vertical white lines randomly in the picture.  Think of a cutscene from a late 90s game to get the idea.

Here comes the worst part of it: the control conversion.  Rather than saying ""Press Shift to dodge this boulder that will kill you"", the game uses the console text: ""Press the 3rd button"".  It took me 10 tries to figure out what ""1 + 3"" was on the keyboard.  To me it would seem easy to re-write the game code to say ""Shift + Enter"" instead of ""1 + 3"".  After 3 months of release delays, I expect much better.

In conclusion, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  ""Obscure"" for $6 is far superior in graphics and gameplay (2 people can play).  This game would be great on the PS2, but this shoddy PC version has really left a foul taste in my mouth.  As of writing this review I have still not finished the game due to sheer frustration with the controls. HORRID PC Port!"
1.0	"If you liked the first STALKER you will love the sequel....BUT......

It is just like the first time. The game is LOADED with bugs that cause crashes, you cannot travel to new areas, you cannot travel back to old areas. In some cases you are PERMANENTLY stuck!!!!

I am referring to patch 1.5.04...the latest as of today. You could play, stop when you do all you can do when a lethal bug hits you and wait for another patch...but the next patch might kill your old saved games. This happened with the 1st STALKER.

RIGHT NOW -
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! Obviously GSC and THQ learned nothing from the first mess they created and have given you another load of headaches, bugs, crashes and poor framerates to deal with.

Wait for at least another patch or two and read some gaming forums to check out how frustrated everyone is right now!!

That includes me. I stupidly thought it would be different this time but it is just as bad if not worse!

The multi-player works fine , but still no single player mode . And as others have stated here .... the multi-player is a bad joke .

Spawn killer's fest , is all this is . Whomever designed these maps should be fired ! My rating of 1 star stands . Sorry EA / Dice , no more of my $$ your way ! Don't waste your time or money on more EA crap !"
1.0	"I was excited to get an item like this because i always wanted to use my gamecube controller to play my games on the PC. I was very excited to get this product until it kept causing my PC to abruptly shut down about 20% of the time. The first time it caused my PC to shut down, i decided to give it the benefit of the doubt cause i figure i had outdated built in drivers. But than it occurred 3 more times with the latest driver.

This item should be pulled from amazon because it is very harmful for a PC to just shut down abruptly and this faulty device causes it to happen.

One last thing, i have actually developed a fear of unplugging USB devices because of this product. Even devices i use everyday that have never been defective. Causes the PC to freeze than, abruptly shut down. Very harmful for your PC, Do not buy."
1.0	"This game is absolutely insane. Nothing makes sense, nothing is funny, crude & rude stupid adult humor.

The plot?
Nope! Doesnt exist, your a drunk squirrel trying to find hes way to a non existing home. Goes onto a adventure helping all sorts of creatures, living & non living objects he helps out everywhere he goes why collecting money. Why? Idk
You don't need money

Characters:
First lets talk about the villian, such a wimp crying over spilled milk and blames hes men.

Berri, conkers lover? Has no meaning
Forgets who he is, blinded by a stupid hat
Gets randomly kidnapped for no reason by some thugs from the stone area for thier (party) club.

A boss made of poo.... Yuck! Disgusting, just why

The stupid stone people that come in female genders. Its really disturbing.

Worms who won't even let you climb a simple mountain :/

References:
Movie refereces are in this game & honestly it ruins it
You got the matrix

This game is weird What were they thinking?"
1.0	"I played (and enjoyed) most all of the TW games up till this one.

Then the ""coach"" in TW09 started taking away my skill points every time i borked a shot... reducing my stats... resulting in more borked shots... rinse repeat.

Thanks for sucking all the fun out of the SP game just to ""balance"" the MP experience.

MAN i hate EA sports.. is there any sport that they don't monopolize with a lackluster series? The game that stopped me from buying future TW games"
1.0	I pre-ordered this over a month ahead of time and packed it up to be returned within an hour of using it. I was disappointed with the user interface since it was an exact duplicate of the vita but less intuitive. I had problems connecting to my psn account through it. The PS4 remote play left a lot to be desired. It had troubles reading my vita memory card. As a big PS fan boy, I find this product to be a huge failure. Disappointing from the get go
1.0	"Looks like a PS2 game. Wouldnt be surprised if the game was built for PS2 then shelved and then reworked with the success of HBO Game of Thrones.

Battles are lazy. Characters speak in jibberish. Avoid this game. Played through the first 9 chapters then tossed game in the trash bin. Other ways to spend $15. This game is a dragon turd"
1.0	At first I liked this game, but not far into the progression of the game it is impossible to work with. It comes with instructions and a customer service number and email. They have not even one time returned my phone calls or emails. I finally gave it to the Goodwill. I do not recommend this game to anyone. Not a very good game
1.0	I purchased this in 2013.  By 2014 they were broken.  The muffs are on a swivel and the swivel broke.  This is made with cheap plastic.  I paid the same price that they go for now. Was a rip-off then and a rip-off now.  The audio also produced a hiss.  Very poor investment. Skip.  Trust me.
1.0	Totally arcade with no value to me. I wanted an authentic Forza experience on my PC. This was a mistake for me. Tried it once and never played it again. It was a complete waste of $$ for me. Strictly Arcade
1.0	Worked fine the first week. Changed TV's once and now the red input doesn't output color so the screen is just blues and greens. It isn't the TV either, the blue works in the red input. Also, every 10 minutes roughly, the screen goes black for a couple seconds then cuts back in. Works for a Week
1.0	Did not last long. The console is made from cheap plastic that's very brittle. Do not buy. One Star
1.0	The download carried a virus that my antivirus software picked up. Carries virus.
1.0	there is no way to play the game since ea took it offline. i would not buy this game if i had to do all over again. My advice is not to buy this game it is not worth the money. the game is not fun
1.0	Sucks, Can't play the game. One Star
1.0	hardly like the original Mortal Kombat series. An all around disappointment One Star
1.0	This is one of the poorest games I have ever played. No story, you have no idea what in the world is going on in the game. The combat is very pointless and there is nothing new about this game at all. The only real positive is that I played this game for about 20 minutes and earned 300 gamerscore in that period. Awful
1.0	Didn't like at all. One Star
1.0	Expected good things from this game, and what did it give me? Constant lag spikes, HORRID graphics (MW1 looking). Don't buy unless you like being dissapointed. Worst COD ever...
1.0	Bought this product to play Mortal Kombat vs. DC with my son but my PS3 never recongized the controller. Never worked
1.0	"Not sure what to say because it won't even run/startup. It has 2 DVD's, then I downloaded & installed 4 separate patches which must be installed in sequence. This game uses alot of bytes. Disc 1 had ""wrong disc"" error message. Disc 2 had a Windows general error and message referred to ""Securom"". I checked the FrontLines.com website, which BTW runs so slow you will think it isn't working, on the forums many people also can't get the game to even run/start, many people have slow/choppy gameplay issues, and some people can't figure out how to patch the game since, again, the patches are not cumulative but must be installed in sequence. The problem isn't my computer system, it surpasses the recommended specs. Apparently some people actually have gotten this game to work, usually I'm the one that never has problems with games/etc. Nonetheless there is something(s) definitely wrong with this game for so many people to have problems. I'm glad I bought this game used so as to not support bad programming companies/games like this. Fuel of Time Wastage"
1.0	"All I probalby have to say is ""steam"" and you know the rest. I have a worthless disc that includes ""STEAM"" and a code, and you still have to download the game. What is wrong with the people who make the games? I know it is a port, but I have a pc. SO, IF YOU SELL A PC TITLE, GIVE US THE DAMN GAME ON THE DISC ! I hope all pc gamers will refuse to buy this crap until they give us what we are willing to pay for. Mine went back, I hope your does too. Tell them to stop forcing player to use Steam and EA, ect. another empty DVD, must install entire game off internet"
1.0	"This might be a good game if it would stop freezing and locking-up my computer. I've installed the patch and contacted Sega twice about this and still no answer. I paid $7.48 for this game at Target and I think it was overpriced, for what I got, by $7.48
Now I know why they were selling it so cheap. I have heard of many others with the same problem. Hulk Freeze"
1.0	"You cannot play this game UNLESS their servers are up.  If they are down, you can't do anything with it.  Its a copy protection scheme, but if they are having problems (like today) and you spent your money, you can't use it.

I played in the beta.  Played Diablo and Diablo II.  Diablo II is more fun than this game.  Granted I only was able to play for about 4 hours today, with all the server problems, but its just not fun and doesn't feel like Diablo.

Save your money.  Buy something else.  I wish I had. Do not spend money on this game and here's why"
1.0	did not work One Star
1.0	"Disappointment... Really this system simply is avarage at best, no wonder it's sinked sega. The worst things are..
1) Save system: no memory card... the saves are recorded in the internal ram.. now apart from the fact  storage is really limited... within 2 years you lose all the games save.
2)Bugs... the most of times the console freezes
3) Bad control, no analogical gamepad exists
4) Localization: Most of the greatest games are japan only. Waste of potential"
1.0	I'm not a fan of arcade racers, and this just feels like another arcade racer to me. I like the precision of the regular Forza games...learning each turn of each track and trying to perfect each lap while tuning your car until it seems to suit you perfectly. That seems lost here. You're forced through a cheesy plot, and have to buy cars when the next race requires it. There aren't very many tight turns on any of the maps, so mostly it's just gas and go. The game does have the physics of a forza game to some degree, but it's mostly just straight-a-ways on half paved, half dirt tracks, so who cares. You can slam into oncoming traffic at 100 mph and just bounce off and just keep going. I played it for a few hours and that was it. It felt more like a burnout game than a forza game to me. Hollow Arcade Racer
1.0	The case and instruction booklet were in fine condition however, the actual game was not anywhere near new condition. I could barely make it through one game without a disc error. Back was scratched in a few different places. Caution to anyone who orders from here. Beware of poor disc condition
1.0	I waited and waited and waited and waited for the game to be on the store shelves. Finally no more delays and I got my over fifty dollar version. Okay. It's gonna be a great game . That's what I have read  it was and after so many delays it had to be considering its predecessors. Five disks to install. kind of like shades of XIII.Don't get a nice thick jewel case however. Got it all installed and then I had to activate it. I can see  their reason why. No problem I thought to myself. I said that  and after an hour activating and decrypting files I'm still not ready to play the game. Think I'll just take it out and put a nice easy to install  ,no fuss,no mess game in and put my long waited for and beautiful copy of HL2 in a closet where I can't see how much money I wasted. Activation takes SO DAMN LONG!
1.0	Went to charge my sp and after it charge went to unplug it and the charger came apart. DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY
1.0	What can I say that hasn't already been said? Perhaps another review though will ward someone from buying this. If you're going to buy a version of NBA 2K15, make sure it's for PS4 or XB1. The PS3 and 360 version is merely a recoating of 2K13 and 2K14. The only difference is the menus and the music. That's it. I'm not even sure why this game is $60 bucks. Even for $30, I'd have a hard time recommending it. If you have 2K14 for the older systems, just play that. There are even custom rosters made by people you can download to emulate the roster in 2K15. Same as 2K13 and 2K14
1.0	"This game is pathetic.  I am a huge wrestling fan and I've played every THQ WWE game.  This is one of the worst and it's obvious the other people who wrote reviews have never played the WWE Smackdown games.

First off the game play in DOR2 is complete garbage just like the first.

Second, they did nothing to make this game better than the first Day of Reckoning.  Hardly any changes.

The CAW feature was the only good thing about the first DOR. The CAW feature in DOR2 is not as good as the first.

WWE should drop THQ.  Sure they can make a great fighting style for the Smackdown games on ps2, but they can't make a good CAW on the Smackdown games for ps2.  Then they can make a good CAW for the GameCube and the Xbox,  but they can't make a good fighting syle for the GameCube and Xbox.

What is wrong with THQ?

Please help me boycot any THQ games until they get a wrestling game right. Complete Garbage.  Ignore these other reviews that say their good cause they don't know what their talking about."
1.0	This is coming from a fan of Wheel Of Fortune. When I was a kid, I got into the experience of the letters that appear in the puzzle. Some of the puzzles are like redundant, meaning this version of Wheel has issues repeating the same ones over and over again, like in the wrong places at the wrong time. What's worse is that THQ is kaput, meaning there won't be any updates to fix this bug, unless Nintendo can do that. I was a fool to waste $50 on this. Another issue I'd like to point out is you can't experience WOF with sound if you're only playing via the GamePad. You'll need the TV for that. Another version of Wheel has like more than 20,000 puzzles. But that too has its share of glitches. Pathetic

1.0	"Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided

*Sigh* Where to begin...

This game could be better named:
""Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base"".

Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one (I've canceled my account and will NEVER do business with SOE again!).

PLEASE, READ ON...

In the beginning...
This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the ""Star Wars"" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any ""Smuggler"" in the game for their opinion.

They strung us along and led us to believe that the ""fixes"" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an ""Expansion Pack"" to sell us! And then once again ""promised us"" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, ""just hang on, this game is going to be great!"" They promised us that they were going to do this ""Combat Upgrade"" and do it right, and it ""wouldn't be released until it's ready!""

We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figure out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...

Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited ""CU"" would be coming out along with the ""Rage of the Wookiees"" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the ""CU"" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...

They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could ""streamline"" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!

The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?

The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or ""EverStar Galaxies QuestWars"" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. I'm sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detail.

As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.

This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.

Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying. People are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!

SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.

You have been warned! A SERIOUS WARNING about SWG and SOE from a WEEK ONE VETERAN!"
1.0	Way way way too easy.  Never played a soils game before so was hoping for a challenge.  After the very lengthy tutorial, I was able to jump right in and practice on progressively more difficult opponents.  Actually no.  No tutorial, first boss is unbeatable, and no progression save.  Lame. Way Too Easy
1.0	The potential of this game is erased because the makers wanted to go ahead and secretly add copy protection software and in effect ruin it for me and many more potential customers.  AT LEAST PUT A STATEMENT ON THE BOX WHICH SAYS THAT IT WILL COME WITH COPY PROTECTION SOFTWARE.  That's just low.  But what can you expect, all these companies are concerned about is money, NOTHING ELSE.  You would be a fool to believe that they care about you and what you think and what you feel. NO, they might say that but only because they want your money.  OK - now you know. All Potential Lost
1.0	I thought this game was going to be like the sims. I WAS WRONG. This game is about being some dog or whatever and you have to survive lmao. who wants to be an animal when you can be a human WOW
1.0	"What a mess of a game. This game attempts to be like GTA or Saints Row but it fails miserably.

The story is a joke, the characters are boring. The only thing somewhat good is the play control.

I am about 8 hours in so far and I have yet to be amazed even once.

It will be a chore to finish this turd of a game. Just Terrible..."
1.0	I won,t give a rating because I tried this battery on my damaged Nintendo ds, it didn,t work. Now that I have a brand new Nintendo ds, I have a battery and free screwdriver on hand when my new Nintendo ds runs out of batteries. Good thing
1.0	Everytime I tried to down load the disc it would show up off centered on the screen and then my mouse would freeze up and I would have to shut the computer down, I have Windows 10.  I can't use it!! Everytime I tried to down load the disc it would ...
1.0	Only worked for a short time One Star
1.0	Proceed with caution when not only purchasing but also installing this game,  many of these sold online come without a disk and you are given a code,  this game can take what seems like forever to download and install,  it requires a graphics card you are likely to not have so do your homework on that and for some reason my computer having since installed and uninstalled this program and now my driver fails and then recovers,  I keep getting these messages after my computer acts as though it wants to shut down,  this program seems to may have done some damage to something inside my computer,  I was excited about the graphics like most people but now I am sorry I bought it. this game can take what seems like forever to download and install
1.0	Horrible controls, cheap animation, dreadful story combined to make a complete waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and play lame free webgames before tossing money at this smelly heap. Worst FPS ever
1.0	This game is an example of everything that has ruined games for me since the early 90's. No pause, no manual save, no map, and even though it's classified as an rpg the character doesn't level up by defeating enemies, nor can they sell items they collect, neither can they gather information on where to go and what to do by speaking to other characters. Strangely, this is not what ruined the game for me. It was the arbitrary soul tendency system, which IS the most cryptic pile of nonsense I have ever run across in a game. I got to hand it to the people who marketed Demon's Souls, they decide to call it an old school hardcore gaming experience, and critics and gamers buy it. That's the reason I bought it. But those old games were hard because of a lack of game testing or technological limitations. This game was probably not tested very much, or at all. It would go a long way in explaining the shizbomb story, and lack of character development. If they can make a game this lazily, call it old school or hardcore, and have the critics and gamers eat it up, I'm going to find it very difficult to trust reviews by others. I would also like to add that I destroyed the game disc, then threw it in the trash. It's home now. I should also add that I beat this sucker. I've beaten many games of this sort, and I always feel the same, that the experience is akin to having teeth pulled sans novocaine. Yeah, it makes you hardcore, but afterwards you won't be smiling much, and you just might deck the doc! Hardcore? No. Just cheap. VERY cheap.
1.0	I bought this hoping to develop some Windows software for it, but it's really very limited and not much fun to develop for. Plus, nobody owns one, so there's no customer base for Kinect software. And there aren't actually any good games for it, so it's not fun to play with either. Worthless
1.0	Complete and totally useless without the receiver unit! It's a paper weight. One Star
1.0	"I wish I had more to say about Battlefield 4.  In my brief time with it, I could definitely agree that this game kicks the crap out of the Call of Duty franchise.  The single-player campaign was intense, varied, and made sure that the player never gets bored.  You pilot a variety of vehicles, the weapon variety is great and the ease with which you can manage weapons is phenomenal.  Also, the game looks incredible!  Detailed textures, smooth frame rate...this is how first-person shooters should all perform.

So what's the problem?  The game is also hideously broken.  During the campaign, you can expect the game to crash on you repeatedly, forcing you to restart the level.  Then the last time this happened to me, I was forced to restart the entire campaign!  Therefore, I regret to say I'm done with the game.  I do not have the time nor desire to keep starting over every time something goes wrong.  It's really a shame, since the game was actually really good.

This kind of bugginess in a game is unacceptable.  There is no way this game was ready for release, and it's astounding that after four months, not a single one of those 2 GB patches have fixed anything.  Don't waste your money on this product.  It doesn't work.  One star. Four months after launch, and this game still doesn't work..."
1.0	could not get to play One Star
1.0	Such a great product that a lot of true fans didn't get because of scalpers. Too bad
1.0	I know we live in a different society now than 30 yrs ago, but kids don't need to be exposed to the language in this game. YES. I KNOW ITS RATED M. But true to the title - Overkill. To much spoils the fun. NOT FOR CHILDREN !!!!!
1.0	Well, I must say that I am extremely disappointed with FSW in many respects.  For one, the graphics are not exactly anything to rave about. They are ok, but that's about it.  And after all the hype this game received and the advertising it put out, it seems they should have saved some money for the developing.  Basically, the actuall gameplay is at a 4 year old level.  Click here, move there. THAT'S ALL YOU DO. And I can't stand the cheesey jargon used in the voiceovers. Horrible! I am an infantryman in the US Army, and I can tell you, no one I know talks like this or uses the goofy lingo the throw around in this game. Also,there is NO open ended gameplay, you can only move to certain areas on the map. The enemy AI and the weapons physics are ridiculous.  You can have your team fire at an enemy out in the open and he won't move, won't throw a frag, won't call in support etc. If you want a REAL war simulation, buy Operation Flashpoint.  It's dated, but still THE best squad/fps/command game ever made.  After all the patches and upgrades and addons and it's truly open ended gameplay,  OFP will probably be the only game that will permanently stay on my hard drive. FSW, nice try, no cigar. LAME,  Save your money!
1.0	The game is as interesting as the original if you can stand the constant hesitations sometimes requiring a restart of the game. It is a collection of all the addons and includes the original program. So unless you are really hooked on the original or have a lot of patience I'd pass on this one. Fallout 3 GOTY Edition
1.0	"I bought this game because I loved New Super Mario and wanted to find another game I found addictive. First of all, this game is for little kids. But I can't imagine anyone enjoying it. It seems like it has no point. Sonic speeds through this ""roller coaster"" type course that goes so quickly it's not possible to follow. And there is nothing really to do. There is no challenge value, all you do it push the forward button and sonic moves really quickly until he gets to the end of the course or runs out of time. Maybe I missed the point of this game, but I wasted my money on this purchase. Unplayable and boring"
1.0	"For those that enjoyed Dungeon Keeper games, this looked like it could fill the void that was left when EA shelved development of DK3.  Early on Dungeons makes some snarky references to both Diablo and Dungeon Keeper, but from there that is where the similarities end.  Early objectives aren't clear, you place items but you're not exactly sure WHY you're placing them.  Hotkeys will frequently vanish, forcing you to re-open your spellbook and rebind the hotkey over and over.  Movement is erratic, although WASD is common for movement, you can let go of the W-key and your character continues to move forward.  Sometimes when going in a straight line, he'll start ""wiggling"" back and forth for no apparent reason.

Right off the bat know that if you have ANY issues with the game support is going to be difficult to come by.  The game's forums are all in german.  Email support is spotty at best, even when I sent off a copy of my dxdiag, the first email I got back... requested I send my dxdiag.  The technical issues I had were choppy sound.  It would studder and when you stopped moving, you'd still hear footsteps for several seconds afterwords.  This ""sound lag"" became very annoying very quickly.  This is despite there already being two patches since it came out.

I'd strongly recommend waiting til this is in a bargain bin and patched to functionality.  What a disappointment. DK ripoff, unplayable, poor support"
1.0	terrible, terrible, terrible game. the combos are impossible and there isn't even a story/tutorial.  i can see why this person sold it. awful
1.0	"I bought (or rather ""bought"", since they didn't actually sell it to me) Halo 2 over the Xbox version, since this version obviously has higher graphic settings, plus has achievement points, which (ironically) the Xbox version lacks.

Unfortunately, it also contains activation.  I assume since it's published by Microsoft that it works however Windows and Office's arcane activation rules work.

Not only doesn't the product description tell you that, I can't even find a warning ANYWHERE on the back of the box!  As soon as I cracked it open, I was met with a big card talking about activation.  Gee, thanks Microsoft.

So, if you want to play Halo 2, play the Xbox version.

Since I'm stuck with it, I plan on playing it-will post an update when I do.  I'm slowly working my way through the Halo series after playing the solid Halo Reach and now Halo Wars (which, while no Age of Empires, was still surprisingly fun).

EDIT: Wow, now I'm discovering Games for Windows Live can't log in from my new system for some reason...newest client just will not connect.  So much for at least getting points from this... Warning-contains activation"
1.0	"God i hate it when companies take things like controlpads and try to make them look aesthetically pleasing to home-decor over gameplay.

it must have been a woman that designed this pad.

i can't play without colored buttons. it makes it take far too long for me to figure out what to push.  color & shapes makes our brains grasp layouts quickly when it counts in a game.
i also hate the lack of different colors of the Wii controller.  controllers need to be all as colorful as the Gamecube pad.

i can't review it based on anything else becuase after i saw this i threw it back to the fishes. No Colors, No Deal."
1.0	Please Xbox Give us MLB The Show.  I cannot take 2K sports anymore, they are the worst year after year.  I am done with them.  The only thing they ever had going for them was the NBA 2K series which has completely gone to crap over the past years.  We need a real developer that doesn't suck. WOW THIS GAMES SUCKS
1.0	I can honestly say that this game is, without a doubt, the most highly overrated game out there. As an experienced Street Fighter II player I found the game to be the same in almost every way. There is truly nothing new here. The graphics are definitely better. But the graphics itself does not impress me. I thought the characters looked rather cartoony in comparison to all the games out there for this current generation of consoles. Second, the movements are actually the same. Yes, there are updated moves but they still look the same to me. The ability to generate the special moves is a little easier compared to the original Street Fighter II. Third, The cut-scenes leave a lot to be desired. I thought they were somewhat bland and cheaply made compared to the characters themselves which are already dated in my opinion. Just look at Call of Duty 4 and you will see what I mean. Fourth, I cannot believe that they charged the amount for this game which is nothing really new. It's just a rehash of all the prior Street Fighter games. Now they have Super Street Fighter at a lower price but still so high in terms of their actual worth. The bonus material, worlwide matches, just doesn't cut it to me. Why don't they have true tournaments periodically to make it worth your while? We certainly have the technology to do this. And when I mean tournaments, I mean a true tournament that is officiated by referees. Finally, yes, the game is supposed to be difficult. But some of the moves by the A.I. opponents are really cheap. I am for challenging games but this one cuts the cake. If I had known how this game was going to be I would not have purchased it. It was a waste of money. Highly Overrated
1.0	"Got it for myself after playing a demo on the iPad. It arrived on time, good condition.

Once I put it in the Xbox 360, i got a message: ""Error. Wrong disc region"". I have a neighbor who has the same console, and there also we got the same message. Basically, it never worked, and I donno what Im to do with this game now, obviously there's something wrong with the disc. As to regiona issues, I never has this problem, as I have both PAL and NTSC games currently running on my XBOX 360... in summary, I was sold a bad disc, and since its not from a store, I cant return it and tell the seller face to face that the disc he sold me has a problem!

Id appreciate it if someone can tell me how to operate this game.
Im putting one star for it, coz I haven't been able to play the game to rate it properly. Didnt work !!"
1.0	"Really was looking forward to this game assuming that things would be better. This is not the case. With BLOPS 2, I couldn't play core modes at all due to the lag. Seeing as they're using the same game engine as BLOPS 2, I get the same results. Can't play core modes on this game since all I get are hit markers. Have 50 down 20 up FIOS connection, wired, but still have lag. This game is crap. The only thing I can even really play is Infected or campaign mode. Core modes are off limits for me seeing as how people can kill me with 2 bullets but I it takes me a whole clip to kill them. Activision knows this is lag but keep on blaming my connection as the root cause of my lag. Surely it can't be the games fault right?

All in all, I wasted money on this game and Activision acts like it's not their fault. Since I got the digital download, can't even sell this crap game. Patiently waiting for Battlefield Hardline now Same lag, updated graphics."
1.0	Horrible. One Star
1.0	Can you believe how many bad games are really out there?  This game does nothing right.  I can barely control the guy, enemies are able to find and kill me in a matter of seconds before I have ANY time to react, and the game is incredibly short.  The Playstation One simply couldn't handle the Tom Clancy games.  Avoid. it doesn't get any worse
1.0	First thing is I am a huge Madden fan and was very disappointed with Madden 13. While the new physics engine was a good idea, it didn't live up to its hype. Players fall over each other after the plays and it just looks dumb. I get Madden every year and was disappointed there was no franchise mode. The coach option in connected careers is close but not the same. You can't even import your NCAA draft classes anymore. The menu layout is awful too. There is no autosave and I always exit out of the menu without thinking and end up replaying games. Connected careers is an ok mode but I have no desire to play it. What I mean is in NBA 2k13 you get interviewed, you can get endorsements, and you have to prove your draft stock in the rookie showcase. In Madden you just pick a team to play for or a current player or coach to play as. And I don't know if its just my copy but on my Madden it has a very bad lag and seems like it is about to freeze occasionally when I throw the ball. While Madden 13 is good for online, that is about the only thing. I like playing online but I like franchise mode more and being able to use my my player from the NCAA game in Madden. I finally sold 13 and re-bought 12. I think Madden 13 is ok but it is definitely not the best Madden ever. What happened?
1.0	I am an adult who discovered the Wii earlier this year.  I really enjoy the Sports Resorts games and thought the attachments would enhance game play.  Unfortunately, I purchased two sets, one for me and one for my wife.  After spending a few minutes trying to attach the controller to the various devices, I gave up.  They fit poorly, seem to be cheaply made and I am sorry I bought them.  Save your money. Sorry I bought it
1.0	This game refuses to run full screen in any display mode.  Had I checked the forums before I bought this I would have known tons of people are having this issue and nothing has been done to fix it since it was released.  I hate playing games that are not full screen so this craptacular game is useless to me. Use at your own risk especially if you use HDMI or DVI.  The little time I tried to play it in window mode it wasn't so great anyway.  Controlling the camera is a major struggle and there is too much QTE.  Mashing whatever button the game tells me to repeatedly whenever the game tells me to instead of actually controlling a character is not my idea of fun. Refuses to run full screen
1.0	Bought one locally and found it had a glitch, after the opening of the game the first choice that you have to make would lock up and the game would freeze. Checked it on two different versions of the Wii. Brought it back to the store got a refund, bought a copy from here and the same glitch. Returned it with a super hassle free process. Wish I could rate that. As for the game, dunno never got to play it. Bought two copies of this game.
1.0	"First of all, the story line is pure B*%$$SIT.

It skipped around from one man to the next.  First you are a marine, then jumping into the back seat of a fighter jet or in a tank unit.

I stopped playing when I was expected to shoot another marine.  Where is the sense in that?  Any of those punk kids who made this game ever served in the military or have any idea how much each man depends on the other.  They should be embarrassed to actually have let this out the door. Did not bother to finish"
1.0	"I loved the game play. It looks like a wacked out cartoon in the best way, and it's a lot prettier than Fallout. The quests are in depth, and really fun as long as you stick to the main quest, (though some of the side quests can get pretty old...)

The only complaint I have about this game is the Corruption of game files. It's not a game play-problem, but a programming one. One glaring and horrific enough that you'd think they'd fix it before the game was released.

I bought this game as a present for my boyfriend and we played for over 10 hours on our first run. We loaded the game up fine a few subsequent times, but two days later we try to load up and suddenly his character is corrupted! A level 26 Beserker gone in an instant. I looked online and apparently this is a common problem that the game programmers didn't fix before releasing, (which doesn't make me think much of them, despite the awesome game.)

I'm currently powerlevel-ing him up, but it doesn't go fast or easy with my 26 Hunter. The point is, I shouldn't have too. It's frustrating and annoying as frilly heck and I resent it like you wouldn't believe.

I've read that the problem comes from not going in and saving properly, (apparently auto-saving isn't reliable,) and shutting off the game during play, or from having the power go out while you're auto-saving. Another thing is that if you get disconnected from Xbox Live don't reconnect right away. Quit and save and THEN reconnect, or there's a chance your file will corrupt too.

Way too much fricking corruption.

The game is worth playing, but take precautions to always save and exit properly. That, or don't get too attached to your character. Corruption"
1.0	Ordered 2 controllers received one broken controller. I wouldn't suggest this remote even if it wasn't broke it was a cheap knockoff Bad
1.0	"I'm so glad I didn't spent more then a couple of dollars for this game.  From the incredibly clunky movement, to the nightmarish lag, to the horrible voice acting - this game doesn't come close to comparing with the RPGs that have been released in the last 10 or 11 years.  I've played games released in 2001 that put this one to shame.  I didn't make it more then 10 minutes before I was so disgusted that I completely removed it from my computer and will rightfully give this game away.  Please, if you're looking for open ended free roam RPG fun - look up the Elder Scrolls series or for pure sandbox goodness: Mount & Blade.

And for the first reviewer who wants to say we shouldn't compare this game to Oblivion?  They shamefully ripped as much off from that game, piled it up with some seriously lazy work and tried to sell it off to the RPG crowd saying it was LIKE Oblivion.  So yeah, I'm thinking we should compare them and when we do, Two Worlds can't even BEGIN to hold a candle.  Save your $1 and buy a candy bar - it would be more enjoyable then this game. Terrible game!"
1.0	worst purchase ever i bought it and the disc was so bad my xbox couldn't even get it to read the name of the game very very bad terible
1.0	"Can't play offline.
I understand why not, but they should at least allow you to access your account, even while in maintenance.

Have an offline log in server that requires little to no maintenance to play offline version

and a log in to play online version.

anyways I'm not getting payed to write a review for them, or to give them free consultation. But seriously buy at your own risk. How come I Can't play the game I payed for?"
1.0	"I really want to love this game, but it is a very challenging game - more in a buggy way than a good way. My kids want to play this, but I dread it, because it is non-stop complaints about how hard and confusing the game is. I have to sit over their shoulders taking the controls constantly to figure things out. It usually takes me awhile to figure it out.

My kids play Mario, Kirby, Nintendo World, Pokemon and a ton of other games with no issues. The Lego games are always a big letdown and this one is no different. Hopefully they release an update to make everything more intuitive and less about ""puzzle solving"" for no reason. Hard and Confusing"
1.0	"When this game eventually works, go ahead and buy it. But until then AVOID AT ALL COSTS. DO YOU HEAR ME? AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!

Oh and i LOVE that after buying it for 59.99 it's now 39.99. GREAT! They realized it's so damn bad they can't even sell it at full price for more than a month!!!

I have not EVER in my life been so enraged by a computer game. F@ck this game and F@ck the people who rushed it out the door before it was ready. AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNTIL IT IS FIXED"

1.0	"Here's the short of it: Just Dance 2016 (and its&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Dance-Disney-Party-2/dp/B0131M66TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Dance Disney Party 2</a>&nbsp;spinoff) is great if you're willing to subscribe to Ubisoft's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Dance-Unlimited/dp/B016VFRS34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Dance Unlimited</a>, a monthly subscription to all 150-songs for the game, for $6.99 a month or $60 a year. If you don't, the game is not nearly as much fun as previous iterations.

The biggest problem is that Just Dance 2016 shows you all the songs without an easy way to identify what you can and can't play without making additional purchases.  That means on the home screen it looks like you can play dozens of songs, but when you click on one to actually play, the game asks you to subscribe for access.  This was tremendously frustrating to my tween, who is a huge Just Dance fan, because most things she wanted to do the game wouldn't let her without more money.  Personally I think its ridiculous to charge $60 for a game and then gimp access by trying to nickel-and-dime (and twenty) the people who bought it.  But if Ubi is going to do it that way, at least give the option to only show the game we can actually play.

We've picked up the newest version of Just Dance every year, and this year's should've been a knock-out.  I've been obsessed with AaronChupa's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-m-an-Albotraoz-34/dp/B00NAPU48U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'm an Albotraoz""</a>&nbsp;for a year and couldn't be more excited for its inclusion.  Some Selena Gomez for the kids and Grease for my wife, and there truly is something for the whole family.  Too bad Ubi decided to take such an aggressive stance selling add-ons that they've made the game un-fun and my girls have gone back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Just-Dance-2015/dp/B00KTNU40E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Just Dance 2015</a>.

1.0	I just bought a GBA a month ago. I figured when I bought it that I would be able to SEE the game I was playing. Silly me. Now I hear GBA SP is coming out and it has a light. I can't return the GBA I just got back to the store so I'm stuck with an inferior product... I'm tired of being [cheated]
1.0	"I'll start out by saying I've never been a huge fan of the Halo franchise. All of the games feature cheap feeling weapons that sound wimpy and are hard to control. The online play is stupid if you aren't a ""pro"".

Let's start with the good:
-The Music

On to the bad:
-The opening cut scene features two characters. Some old lady being interrogated by a faceless dude. While the art and animation looks fine, the lip sync is off, and the voice casting is all wrong. You have a woman in her 70's being voiced by someone who sounds like they are in their 30's. It just didn't work.

-The weapons have no weight to them. I guess you could chalk this up to the fact that Spartans are super soldiers, so things like weight and recoil might not be an issue for them, but guess what, I'm not a spartan. I'm just a normal human. I need some sort of connection to the player character, and in a shooter, that connection begins with the play of the weapons. They were all wimpy and sounded stupid.

-Can we get a cover system, please? Honestly, a real cover system. Building a cover system into a FPS isn't new and hard. It should be in here by now.

-The story is lame, and as is with the case with the other Halo games, makes no sense at all.

-Just like the previous Halo games, the sound design was sub-par and implementation was all off. It's hard to blame the sound designers for this, since they inherited the franchise from another game studio, and had to stick to certain sounds for consistency sake, so I get that, but at least beef the gun sounds up. It still suffers from the same gameplay dialogue implementation issues that the other Halo games had, which really bothered me.

-It just isn't fun. You run around killing bad guys. Big whoop. That's been done 3 times before in this franchise, and there is no real payoff. There are tons of shooters out there, and there was nothing new in this game. I don't get the point of it. Why was it released?

I will say the game looked good, but honestly, that is just keeping up with the Joneses at this point. Most AAA big budget titles look good. That doesn't impress me. There is nothing engaging here. There is no good story. Nothing to really suck you in and make you care about the characters at all. No substance. Just mindless killing. The lack of a real cover system just makes me shake my head. To me that is laziness on the part of the developers. Just implementing a good cover system could have done wonders to this game. Make it feel more real. After all, we see Spartans taking cover in the commercials and cutscenes. Why can't I do that when I am playing? Makes no sense.

I guess I was more insulted than anything with this game. To me, it looks like Microsoft was really looking to just make a buck rather than put out a title that is as groundbreaking as the very first Halo game, or games like the Uncharted franchise. It's like the God of War games. Just recycled nonsense for the sake of making money.

Do not buy this unless you are one of those 12 year old kids that spends all their time playing shooters online and swearing when their mom isn't in the room. There is just no point to this game. If you want to check it out, borrow it from a friend or rent it. nothing new to see here."
1.0	"OMG!!!!  this has got to be the WORST NFL video game on ANY GENERATION console.  I started playing Madden back in 1992 on the SEGA GENESIS.  Let me tell ya, the physics in '92 madden are more REALISTIC than these CRASH test DUMMIES they have in Madden '13.  This is ABSURD.  How did EA get away with making a so-called NFL sim video game like this???

I hope the NFL will NOT extend this contract again to EA.  PLEASE NFL COMMISIONER DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE EA THE RIGHTS.... EA...are u SERIOUS?????"
1.0	This game has graphics of a ps2 or xbox game,if you don't believe me just youtube the video. especially the first cutscene of the game it's horrible and bad voice acting, i know it's a racing game and all, so lets talk about the controls, driving a car is so slippery that you will take a little while to deal with it and physics is non existent in this games, cars go flying for no reason and all races plays out the same, race, drive and shoot, or mash the X button to keep your balance while jumping on to a truck. plus your car has a health bar, so you can't crash too much but it's hard when people are shooting at you and drives insanely fast. i pay 10 bucks for it and not even worth it. movie cash in
1.0	"Yeah, it has a nice fit, but if you like to have a 10lbs helmet on then this is for you.

The mic is immobile.  But it looks really cool to have it on.

Sound range is quiet.  Tested on most applications, works, but the top of the ears hurt after a bit. Is it a CROWN?"
1.0	"First off, I have always been a huge fan of the Fallout games, Including Fallout 3.

But, this game is horribly broken. It has been a very long time since I've seen a BSOD (blue screen of death), but Bethesda and this game have brought them back. The game reboots my computer constantly with blue screen crashes. I haven't seen those in 3 or 4 years. There is nothing wrong with my computer, except that it is a tad outdated. The drivers and direct x are all up to date and work perfectly with everything, except this game. The fact that you also need that piece of crap steam just to run the game makes it complete garbage.

Do yourself a favor and don't give Bethesda more money to ruin the Fallout name. Hopefully a company that knows how to program will pick up the Fallout series and go back to making great games like the originals. Do not buy this"
1.0	no good. One Star
1.0	I rented this game to play with my girlfriend.  After watching the uninspiring cut scenes, which could have been done on a Super NES, we were ready for the boating action.  Unfortunately the deathmatch and storyline games are both so bleak and repetitive this game would qualify as the first shareware Xbox game, except it costs as much as a quality game like Halo.  After a few games, I returned it straight to Blockbuster, even though there were still three days left on the rental.  I'm really glad I bought SSX Tricky just after I rented Blood Wake. Not Recommended
1.0	The game is next to impossible to play with the wii remote and nunchuk. It' would be nice if you had the option to use a controller. garbage
1.0	[...]. the movement on this game is so bad.in top spin 1 and 2 the movement is great no problems moving the players.but on this game the players just don't respond to movement when you move the right joystick.i know this sounds hard to believe but trust me if you rent this game and try it out you will  find out exactly the same thing i did.the players movment is just so bad and just responds very sluggish to the controls.top spin tried to make this game more realistic to real tennis but it failed.if you want to play the most realistic tennis game to date get smash court tennis 2 for ps2.hopefully when smash court tennis 3 comes out for 360 in august it will be exactly like smash court tennis 2 with just a few minor improvements.because thats all it needs the game is the best tennis game out there.my guess  is the other 5 reviews on here are people on the payroll of  top spin 3 company.this game only deserves 1 star for its graphics,but great graphics don't make a great game. movement is terrible!
1.0	It never let me download the game. A Lilac Wolf and Stuff Review
1.0	"The premise of the game sounded great- a GBA version of LOTR. Just what I needed to relive the fun of the movie. Sure, there were a few glitches here & there, but initially I had a fun playing it. Plus it came with little cards of the characters, which was neat.

Then came the big glitch. The glitch that made it impossible for me to continue playing. The glitch that froze up my game. At one point during the game, about 2/3 of the way through, I tried entering a new area. Evidently the game decided that I should've finished something else first, so it completely froze up- making further gameplay impossible. Since some parts of the game were incredibly frustrating due to glitches that made it very hard to complete, I just lost interest in trying to re-play to get to that spot in the game. I traded it in, only to discover that I wasn't the only one who was having this trouble.

This could've been far better done. This was just a shoddily made game that was thrown together at the last minute. Save your money & don't even get this. Fun... when it ran"

What is the point of having the nintendo microphones if some games work with other microphones and do not work with the system branded microphones? Does every singing game require a different set of microphones?

I now have this game which does not work and two nintendo wii USB microphones that do not work. Not very good standardization on somebody's part. Cannot get to work with Wii U and Nintendo Microphones"

1.0	"This game suffers from so many problems. First, the load times between pages are really long and annoying. Second, the puzzles are boring ""find the item"" ones that require talking to everyone and clicking everywhere on the screen until you can advance the plot. Last, the game has bugs that cause it to crash and end unexpectedly. This was verified when I complained to technical support, there are major bug problems. For example, in the game you find a raft - but if you open it too far from the water you lose your progress and the game crashes. Dumb. Buggy game - Boring Puzzles"

1.0	"First of all, since I live in Los Angeles, let me explain something to everyone that is playing this game all over the world: the ONLY way that this game slightly resembles L.A. is with its street names and freeway numbers - that is IT. It looks NOTHING like LA, feels NOTHING like LA, and 90% of this game is still completely made up. Yes, that's right. Anyone (and I mean ANYONE) who actually lives here knows exactly what I'm talking about. No traffic - are you kidding me? The creators of this game must live in Ohio somewhere. Street signs completely wrong half the time. Everyone, even tourists know that after Santa Monica Blvd in Hollywood the next street up North is Sunset Blvd, not whatever they put in this game.
The soundtrack is probably the worst one of all video games ever created. Nothing but rap. Dialogs are extremely cheesy and stupid. The game is VERY short. The controls are aweful. One word that would also describe this nonsense of a game is BORING.
Let's face it people: GTA Vice City will NEVER be beaten. I don't care how many times other developers try to mess with it, it will not happen. VICE CITY FOREVER.
Bottom Line: if you have GTA expectations, or if you were a fan of Vice City, do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this game. Waste of money. Ridiculously disappointing"

1.0	"I've played both Red Alert 1 & 2--with RA: 2 still a favorite for it's mix of gameplay, humor and just overall fun.  Having been disappointed last year by the lackluster C&C 3: Tiberium Wars (which, like its predecessor, suffered horribly for speed and gameplay issues, while RA: 2 did not, nor did the excellent C&C: Generals) I was hoping RA: 3 would take me back to what got me into these games--fun, challenging missions, a bit of humor, and hours of fun.

What I got was...C&C3, dumbed down.  I mean really dumbed down.  I'm not talking about the FMV scenes or the hot babes (most of whom out-acted the ""professional"" actors who appeared in C&C3), which I was prepared for, but the gameplay itself:

--Units just about crawl across the screen.  Even fast-movers, like MiG jets, take forever to get anywhere.  You're forever jumping back and forth trying to see where the unit you just sent to attack is, if it hasn't already been destroyed.  And there is NO option to change that speed.  If there is, it's well-hidden.

--Too much power:  RA1 & 2 started you off with relatively weak units and gave you a challenge by having you overcome enemies using them.  Not so here--you're handed units capable of doing major damage almost from the start.  It takes a good chunk of challenge from any mission, which is not helped by the

--AI Commanders, or as I thought of them, ""cannon fodder"".  Using these guys means every mission can play out the same--you send them out to distract the enemy, while you build up your forces and go for the win.  That's fun about...one time.  After that it just sucks out any challenge there might have been, and you don't have the option to turn these guys off.

--Loooong load times at startup.  I swear, it takes a full minute or more just to reach the main menu!  Worse, it took a full 2 hours to install this--actual installation itself to about 1/2 hour, the remaining hour and a half was spent trying to stop the game from trying to install itself twice (running two versions of setup) and crashing in the process.

Are there any good points?  Well, you get some very attractive ladies to look at in the FMV scenes, and there's George Takei, who really plays the role of the Emperor of the Rising Sun very well.  The units are surprisingly varied though infantry is pretty weak.  Graphics are pretty.  Music is kind of cool.  But beyond that...nope.  Don't waste your money.  If you want real gameplay that's fun, fire up a copy of Red Alert 2 and go back to that.  It's 100% better than this waste of time.

That's all I have to say. What happened to the Red Alert games?"

1.0	"- Doesn't work with ION Drums. I've yet to try other legacy products.
- The DLC transfer process is absolutely awful. Did Harmonix even think about it?! There's no way to download your purchases in bulk, and if you go song-by-song through the store, the 'purchased' information doesn't represent reality. So, you have to click every song, try to buy it, and then see if you own it already via the Xbox Live message. It takes HOURS.
- There's no way to adjust instrument (or vocal) volumes in-game without pausing (at least not that I can find).
- Doesn't work with ION Drums (I know I said it already, but it's shameful).

After years and years of amazing Rock Band gameplay, this iteration is seriously lacking. The horrible implementation of prior DLC support is embarrassing (and a massive waste of time)... especially because the only reason people are buying this game is to move their library to the current platform (as the on-disc songs are mediocre at best). No ION drum support is shameful, especially since it's USB (there are no proprietary drivers or wireless chips to deal with). I'm willing to bet that ION drummers make up a huge chunk of their monthly DLC revenue. At least make it work with the MIDI Pro Adapter (also a no)!

Their focus when making this game was selling a mediocre game with some more dumpster-bait plastic instruments, NOT supporting their fans who have spent hundreds of dollars on DLC and hundreds more on legacy instruments.

Had I known, I never would've considered buying it.  I assumed they would truly be classics, board games that families actually play.  The graphics are terribly generic.  I still like Wii Sports, Cross Bow Shooting & Brain Academy the best.  This Ultimate Board Game doesn't remotely measure up.  My younger kids liked the checkers, but it's difficult to get a hold of the game pieces.  They also liked Battle Ship, although it lacks any challenge that the actual board game has.  It's just not worth your time or money. Not what I expected ...."

There are no mapping for this controller in the various games premade to be usable.

I may be naive but  I would think that if Steam has a game on there system,  they would make sure it works with their own controller.

1.0	"Ok, to begin, the game feels like Diablo 2 with better graphics.  They moved a few things around, copied a LOT of stuff from World of Warcraft  (not all bad) but if you played that you will see a LOT of influences from there.  Blizzard also put in auction house so they can try and make more money and forced people to play online ALL THE TIME.

Ok, so Blizzard's idea is online piracy but basically it's laziness and it shows.  Playing a single player game is EXTREMELY frustrating when you have massive problems waiting in line to log into an online server so you can play by yourself.  It takes what could be a great Diablo 2.5 (It really DOES feel like that) and turns it into hell itself because if there happens to be a lot of people online, you lose connection (and the dungeon resets - along with an hour or two of progress any time you temporarily lose internet connection), or the online game servers are down, you simply cannot play the game.  Oh and lag spikes during single player games are amazingly fun.  Yes this happens often when playing this game due to Blizzards' requirement to be online.  I loved playing Diablo 2 and this game brings some of that feeling back but I can see myself not playing much after beating it out of pure frustration with the online requirement to play by myself.  Poor move Blizzard.  I would not recommend this game in general, mostly due to the single player restrictions and frustrations. D3 = Meh"

1.0	"Definitely the very WORST in the series.  This title comes with the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection for PS3.  As great a collection as it is, this game should never be a part of the Metal Gear canon.  The overall level design strategy is god-AWFUL.  I didn't find the gameplay too challenging, but I threw in the towel when I had to fight the tank in the desert.

Apparently, the only weapon that can destroy the tank are mines.  I had 10 mines on me, and they weren't enough to take it down.  You REALLY think I'm going to go back through allllll those rooms and look for a supply of mines??  You gotta be kidding me!  They could at least have some mines to raid out of a truck at least 2 or 3 screens away!  But nooo....  The best part is that mines are the ONLY weapon that could do damage to the tank.  Grenade launcher?  Nope.  Remote-controlled rockets?  NOPE....not even those damage the tank.

You would think that the people who developed this game could reasonably assume that other heavy-duty weapons other than mines would damage a tank.  I'll say this....if Hideo Kojima had ANY part to play in this game at all, he really should be ashamed of himself. Tanks, but NO TANKS"

They someone took the controls that they've been using for years and made them bad. Also the game keeps trying to be humorous but it's just not, all the jokes are just terrible. The only good part of this game is the system where you get to use the left and right control sticks to move you're feet to do a trick. But you can just play the next Tony hawk game Proving Ground. It's actually a good game and includes the trick thing. So if you don't want to get pissed at the world then don't play this game Don't Buy This, it's Pathetic

1.0	"I am becoming convinced that none of the traditional gaming headset vendors can create a decent gaming headset. At least not one for XBOX One and have it be completely wireless (no chat cable).

After numerous issues with Turtle Beach's 800x, including an RMA, I have decided to try the ASTRO Gaming A50s now that these are completely wireless. I have read all these great reviews on them, but I have to tell you for $300 these do not feel like they should cost that much.

For one. They simply do not work without the USB cable plugged into the headset itself for power. I am guessing the power button simply does not work because moving the power button does not appear to make any difference to the operation of the headset. I can only power them up with a USB cable connected. I am very disappointed in the quality of these out of the box.

Once they have power, they sound nice enough. The controls take a little getting used to. You have to change the ratio of the voice chat volume to the game volume, and then you can adjust the volume as a whole. I am not sure yet if this is better than having two volume controls, one for chat and one for game volume.

I would also prefer a mute button. I do like that the mic mutes when moving it up, but also like the option of tapping a button. The other buttons take a little getting used to as they are pretty small and on the back of the right ear cup. It will take some getting used to where they are.

Finally the charge base seems a little temperamental. It appears to take a little finesse to place it properly to get it to charge.

If mine were not defective when opening the box, I would probably give these 4 stars, but receiving a broken unit gives me reason to believe the QA process that Astro uses is not very good. This makes me wonder what other issues may pop up.

UPDATE 2/5/2017
I have a replacement set from Astro and they power up and work OK. The mic was pretty mute when talking with my friends through XBOX live. I connected the setup to my PC and and the MIC volume was set to about 75-80%. I punched it to 100%. Now they think I am very loud. I moved the mic farther from my face to account, but will probably turn the mic down a little more in the PC application. Just sort of a pain to take it off my XBOX, move it to the PC and sync the new settings and then move it all back. Sort of trial and error. The headset sounds good enough, and it is relatively comfortable. I am really not liking the only mute option is to move the headset boom all the way (ALL THE WAY) up. If not, all the way, it does not mute. It makes noise when you handle the boom to mute it, which is counter to the point of muting. I am OK with muting with the movement of the mic boom, but it should mute sooner and not be ALL the way vertical. It really should have a quick tap button to mute though. Far more efficient. Also, still not pleased with the way it sits in the stand. Still pretty flaky, requiring a little fussing to get it charging.

If you do not need or desire 100% wireless on XBOX One, I would recommend another option. It will save you a ton of money and probably give you much better features to boot.

Update 2/27/2017
Operation has been fine for the last few weeks. It still takes some effort to get the headet seated into the base properly to charge it. A little surprised this is how Astro decided to design this headset and they were OK with the charging system. The lack of a proper mute button is really becoming irritating. I hate it when people are sneezing, coughing, or otherwise making unwanted noise into my ear. I do my best to mute my mic to mitigate that with everyone listing to me as well. Not having a proper mute button is really making this difficult. I cannot swing the mic boom all the way to the farthest upright position to engage the mute fast enough to catch a sneeze. I find it odd that this would also be the way they would design this. There is no reason you cannot have two mute options. One with moving the mic boom up, and it should activate at considerably less than 90 degrees, the other being simple tap-able button on the outside of the ear cup. My wired Logitech USB headset had this feature and love it. Use it for conference calls using Skype all the time.

What could have made this headset great, is a mute button and a better charging option that did not rely on a flaky seating of the headset in a base station. Seems there was some odd design choices here that really hold these headsets back and make me regret shelling out $300 for a supposedly premium experience.

Update 3/22/2017
Two major bugs with this headset
1) The base station seems to 'loose connection' with the console routinely. The best way to work around this is to unplug the USB and plug it back in. Sometimes switching to PC mode and back will fix it but not always. Some forums suggested this is some issue with the XBOX instant on feature, but I have found the headset base looses its connection to the Xbox regardless of the instant on being enabled.
2) The game chat does not work in all games. XBOX Party Chat works fine (as long as you unplug and replug the USB in) but games like Destiny also have game chat, and the headset will not broadcast voice. It does not even detect any noise being transmitted by my MIC, but I can hear others talk. This is also a serious issue. Not everyone uses Party Chat or has issues of their own with Party Chat. So having a headset that does not work in game chat is very limiting.

At this point, if I could return this headset I would. If this were a $50-90 dollar headset, I could kind of forgive all the issues and design flaws with this headset, but for $300, the experience should be exceptional and it is not.

UPDATE 9/15/2017: Firmware update and fixed the issue with requiring the USB to be unplugged and reconnected every so often for the XBOX to detect the headset, but now it is back and doing it more than ever. It actually takes multiple attempts to disconnect and reconnect the USB now. The issue with game chat not working is still a problem even in Destiny 2. I don't know if this is something specific to Destiny as I don't really play other online games that require or can benefit from voice chat.

Worst money I have ever spent, Well, now tied with the crap headset of the Turtle Beach Stealth 800x.

I HOPE that the new headset that Turtle Beach is releasing, which uses the native wireless protocol of an xbox controller, may be better, but never again will I buy a wireless gaming headset without trying it out first. I highly recommend you try before you buy or simply look to wired headsets. Can no-one create a decent gaming headset?"

1.0	I would not recommend the sequel to anyone simply because it does not live to any of the expectations it was amounted to. The new infected characters are lousy and not very creative, it has become overly complicated and lost all of its fun as well as a notable decrease in the quality of graphics. It is no wonder Valve has spent over $25 million dollars advertising the game since otherwise it would have failed, which I believe it definitely deserves to. Instead of adding to the first feature of the game the company rushed through a second production in a year coming up with something that is pretty much useless and much worse than the first game. Left 4 Dead 2 does not really bring anything new, in the sense of concept, it just changes characters which I could do very well by using some skins and provides some new maps to shoot each other in. Not worth it. Dissapointing

1.0	"Oh brother.
After eagerly awaiting to see what the N-Gage will be like, I get my hands on one and find it to be a tremendous disappointment. Let me put it to you this way: everything negative you've read about in all those videogame magazines is true. This is a device that should be marketed to the cell phone crowd, not the videogamers. Essentially, it comes across as a Nokia phone wrapped around a fancy new package, right down to the obvious ""cell phone"" screen.
It does several things, but unfortunately does none of them well. The games look great in presentation, but they are presented on a vertical (!!!) phone-style screen which is simply too small and produces too many headaches from eyestrain. The cartridge position is ridiculous, I hated having to perform surgery on the silly thing just to play a game. A strange idea, especially when you read Nokia's official explanation as to why the cartridge is ""buried"" inside the device which makes no sense. The menus and built-in management were both a mess. Talking on it is an issue all by itself: not only is it terrible to hear in public areas, but its downright embarrassing holding this electronic taco up to your ear! And who wants to splurge on a handset when the option to use it as a normal phone could have been made so much better?
Few games are available for it, but that's common. That's not my beef. The problem is that the system itself is simply filled with too many design flaws. If Nokia (obviously a phone company) REALLY wants to create a GAME machine and then market it as a GAME machine, they should have gotten together with an outfit like Nintendo to help them design it for gamers in mind. It's pretty obvious that they had no idea what they were doing. I seriously believe this thing was rushed out the door for Christmas, but the fact the Nokia refused to listen to early consumer complaints about it at showings doesn't support that theory.
Let me put it to you this way: I have a beautiful cell phone I adore (a Panasonic GU87), a minidisc player and a GBA. I'd rather have those three than this any day since I get far better performance and usage out of them as opposed to this thing. I took mind back and got a refund.
The N-Gage is, unfortunately, a victim of its own design. Part phone, part videogame, part MP3 player, part radio, etc., it really doesn't fit or perform well in any of those categories. It's a TACO!"

I complained to amazon but rather than deal with the problem, they blocked my ability to file any future complaints or returns.

Of course amazon will probably censor this review.  (If they don't I'll be amazed.)

1.0	i bought this to fix my original gameboy sp because the hinges were broke and it was old. Everything was fine until it got to the hinge installation. theirs broke in two when i tried to tap them in. junk
1.0	This version has 4 car types and 9 tracks, whoopdifreakindoo. If you are a fan of San Fransisco Rush, this is the absolute worst version ever. Rush 2 Extreme Racing U.S.A. for N64 kicks this games tail pretty hard. This game has horrible graphics and even more horrible music. I would really like to see Gamecube or PS2 release a Rush 3 and actually put some time and energy into it to develope it to its full potential, It's sad to see a great game go to waste and collect dust on old platforms. Worst version of the coolest game!
1.0	"This game is ridiculously clunky and s***ty. It looked rather cool, videos and pics really drew me in. Cinematic are garbage, usually a aperture of a game that a creator tries too hard on and u wish they tried more on thr story. However it all just sucks. A cinematic cuts out beofre it seems like it should leaving question and uncertainty and to what is happening in this story that you already know nothing about. I've spent hours aimlessly wandering around looking for the first person who is supposedly going to die if I don't find him..im pretty sure he's freaking dead. There's no direction. As to where you need to go. Just ""find this guy"". Which makes me wonder if I'm even going the right way or if the games just letting me wander around stupidly.
game play isn't horrible, it can respond how it should, but I haven't seen my enemies be a staggred much at all even though the game claims I could. Making a character class seems pointless as the character can be adjusted to fit whatever play style you want. Sooo it's a useless setup.
to add to the frustration of the game just overall sucking. The voice is completely off in every scene my character attempts to speak. Basically he screams in pain, and a few seconds later thr act that caused pain happens, or the other way around and it has happened and then he's screaming about being hit.. don't give this company your money the games trash and they should've released updates to have at least fkn solidified the game to be enjoyable to play. But no. Wish i didn't buy this...."
1.0	"Hard to tell if this game is Call of Duty, or a really really really off-brand Halo Franchise game.

In regards to campaign gameplay, it was highly obvious that this was made with Co-op in mind; that being said, if you enjoy story driven campaigns, this game really falls short. The story is unclear, and it essentially revolves around uninteresting settings and waves and waves of enemies. There were times in campaign where it would even get glitchy, probably as a result of the amount of AI coming out of nowhere at you.

In my opinion, the Call of Duty franchise needs to get back to the basics, or completely dissolve. It is totally cool if you would like to make games like this where soldiers can do all sort of unrealistic stuff, but please, for the love of God, stop piggybacking on the old Call of Duty name for the sake of increasing your profits. Get back to basics! Terrible game."
1.0	the batteries are broken it is no electricity in after a week charging time are probably too old they have thrown in the garbage  you can  keep  the money but never i will make  anyone deal with TNP Direct  so much for sure ... are probably too old they have thrown in the garbage you can keep the money but never i will ...
1.0	This game is soooo fun, but sooooo many bugs.  You think thats nothing?  Trust me, what a pain in the bum.  Glitches, stalls, ugh.  I have two copies for playstation and both have the same problems.  YET, if you buy it knowing and expecting bugs, or if it's ever re-released without them, this could be your favorite game ever.  Puzzle action without being lame...so grinchy. 2 copies of this game and more bugs than at a roach farm
1.0	Ordered from UK seller only $7 plus shipping. Arrived pretty prompt. But unable to use because virus protection plan would not allow it to download to computer. Stated disc had virus. Filed claim for issue seller contacted requesting returning product. Seller can keep my $7+. Throwing disc away. No need to try again. Especially back and forth with UK! VIRUS
1.0	"The concept and idea of the game is great. The problem is that the techonology cannot make it real.  The exercises that work well, running, jumping are fine. The resistance band exercises are horrible.  Why- The system is not sensitive enough to ""read"" what your doing and the controls have to held in the ""exact"" right position for the game to read your movement, this equals major frustration when your holding the resistance bands above your head for 5 minutes because the game cant read what your doing.  Then as other reviewers have reported the resistance bands break.  I worked through the easy level and it was bad and during the intermediate level it was intolorable as a 20 minute workout was taking an hour to complete due to the inept reading by the Wii system. This problem takes the fun out of playing this game. I took mine to a video store and traded it off.  I cannot recommend this game for working out.  Maybe if they remake it using the motion plus system it might work correctly, who knows, but as it is now, its a total waste of your money. Concept=A+,  Actual game play D-"
1.0	"I literally have no idea where to start. I am still at such a loss for words for this game, that I am shocked it even exists.

I am putting this in 2 parts. The first stage of my disappointment, and the second.

First.

1: The pre-buy crowd that I was in got treated to a lovely heaping pile of incomplete garbage on release day.
2: The game itself is nothing like it's hit predecessors. Skill trees? No, you just get access to more skills over time... No skill points, no decisions. Just tick a box and go to town.
3: Zero. Support. Ever.
4: In the first week of release, I had more downtime and lost time due to serverside issues, than actual play time. Bad.

So all of these things made me sad, and I uninstalled and Shelved D-3 till now... The winter of my discontent.

Second.

So I installed it again. What do I get? Frequent and unreconcilable Hard Crashes. It literally locks my computer up, and my forces restart after about 10-13 minutes of play. Consistently and reliably.

For reference, I run an Asus G73sw, Win 7 64 bit. It runs every other title in my library flawlessly, including:
Farcry 3
GTA 4
Skyrim (heavily modded to boot)
XCOM: Enemy Unkown
Homefront
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Series
Saint's Row 4
Sid Meier's Civilization 5

So. Not my computer. It is an interaction between D-3 and my comp. I am so disappointed in Blizzard, that I'm not even disappointed anymore... Except in myself. Biggest Disappointment Since Starcraft 2."
1.0	The reviews are 100% accurate. This game is atrocious! Horrible gameplay and graphics. I honestly don't know how they can mess up a game this far into this gen. This game, I'm absolutely serious, seems about 10 years old. First Duken Nukem now this... I'm starting to think Gearbox will never get my money again. BELIEVE THE REVIEWS!
1.0	Yeah.  Since the game is already in stores and is supposedly in stock, i'd like to know how many more weeks it will be before this game ships seeing as i ordered it a month ago. Where is it?
1.0	Can't rate it because I returned product One Star
1.0	It didn't work when I put the game in. I tried continously and it did not worked at ALL. I happened to contact the seller immediately and he said I was able to return it. I was disappointed Didnt work
1.0	This is an incredibly cheap machine with terrible software.  I have no idea what happened to Microsoft.  They used to be a pretty quality conscious company. QUALITY ISSUES
1.0	This is a really dumb, meaningless game.  Glad I didn't pay for it.  Spend your money wisely and on other DS games.  Any one of them is better than this. Real dumb
1.0	First I was irritated by the unnecessary profanity.  Then I was greatly irritated by the Quick Time Events (QTE). Finally, I could not defeat the Kayran monster on page 16 of the 84 page script, so the game is over for me.  There is no way for me to go on. For me, the game was a waste of money. A Waste of Money
1.0	"Synapse 2.0 does autoupdate- WITH NO WAY TO DISABLE IT.

So let me play it out for you online gamers out there; you are in a match... you are winning. Your computer out of the blue alt-tabs to the razer update. okay you alt tab back into game. Match is still going; 10 seconds lost no biggie. YOUR COMPUTER RESTARTS ITSELF AFTER THE UPDATE IS FINISHED! IT DOESNT WARN YOU AND RAZER DOES NOT GIVE A WAY TO DISABLE THIS!!!

So any edge you thought you might have had with a razer... is absolutely an illusion.  Futhermore, customer service has verified there is no way to turn off autoupdate!!!

A PROGRAM THAT RESTARTS MY SYSTEM IS NOT ANY PRODUCT THAT I WANT AS A GAMER! NO WAY!!!

1.0	Worst of the series.... Not as good as it's predecessors...
1.0	"Let me be very clear. This is not a review of the game but rather the product. MGS 3 is still regarding as the best in the series and it is one of the most innovative video games ever made, clearly way ahead of it's time.

I purchased this as a nostalgia item and I thought it would come sealed but it was not the case. The packaging is a reseal and didn't come in an official PS2 seal. This begs the question whether the item was used or not as I thought I was buying a new item. I couldn't see where it was written that this was a used item but it came in a seal and I expected it to be new. A Product Review, not the game!"
1.0	"When I saw they were letting people write reviews on this, I let out an involuntary cackle of malicious glee, and pursed my lips for the cathartic venting that is to come.
You may have heard legends of terrible games, depending on how much of the internet you are exposed to. Superman 64, Bubsy 3D, Atari's E.T., and the entire Sonic Franchise. Well, even amongst the sordid mediocrity and perfidious failure that is the Sonic Team's trademark, Sonic '06 may be the coup-de-gras. The queen mother. The magnum opus. Etc.
Where does one begin to write a review when I am limited to the tiny chat-box of Amazon's review service? It cannot possibly contain my unfocused vehemence or general saltiness towards this-oh, most hateful of games!
Let me just say that, were I to choose between rolling a cannonball down a hill onto a group of small children, or to beat this game in its entirety, I would be stifling a giggle as I quipped about, ""getting the ball rolling"" and waving to the kids below. It is an historically bad mistake to play this game.
It feels much like playing the Alpha version of a bad indie game. Y'know the ones- from the back alleys of Steam or the corners of the internet. Unfocused, with glitches sprinkled about like a seasoning of idiocy, this game leads you by a hook in your navel on a tour-de-force of history's worst missions and side-quests. Along your maddening way, you run into a motley cast of characters so two-dimensional, they could fit into the pockets of an emo-kid's skinny-jeans.
The soundtrack...exists. I need say no more. But I will. Think elevator music done by an ""up-and-coming"" garage band. In reverse.
The voice acting was done by a team of out-of-work car salespeople,who were given one take to say all of their lines in what sounds to be a cotton-ball manufacturing plant.
The vague gesticulations at a plot were written down by a man with a 109 degree fever and an addiction to hallucinogenic drugs. (He also died after the first campaign was written, it seems. There is no plot to speak of after Sonic is conquered.)
And much more tomfoolery and shenanigans abound. All I have to say for playing this game...""It's no use!"" This Actually Exists?"
1.0	This game is so hard for my youngster that he has gotten bored with it after only a short while. There are no real cheats for this game and there is NO easy mode. If your child wasn't born a gammer don't get it.. I did write to the company complaining about this game because it is marketed for small children but is too difficult for them to play.. They could care less! I won't buy another scooby doo game. This game is NOT for a child!
1.0	not a good controller One Star
1.0	"Every year since Ghosts, I've been stupid enough to buy the new call of duty, and I had faith in this game when I ordered it. The first thing I tried was the multiplayer. The first thing that I noticed was how slowly paced the gameplay was. Cod is known for their fast-paced gameplay, but there are several times during the match when I don't even hear gunshots around me. Also, half the time I die is when an opponent hits me with a crowbar or punches me with boxing gloves, and that gets old and boring very fast. Also, the maps are layed out terribly, and the game is geared for campers. The hit detection is also terrible, you know, when you shoot your opponent 15 times, but your opponent kills you in 2 shots. The other thing that drives me crazy in this game are the DLCs. I'm not against the idea of DLCs, as long as there's a decent content to price ratio. I haven't bought any of the DLCs because they are very over priced. Each DLC costs $15, and all that's included are a few new multiplayer maps, and a zombies map. And we all know about the campaign, it is very boring. I quit after the second mission, and so did many of my friends. As far as the zombies gameplay, it isn't bad, it can just be very confusing if you are used to BO2 zombies. Overall, the thing that pisses me off the most about this game is that in MP, about 50% of the time, you don't even die from a gun, you die from boxing gloves, crow bars, extremely overpowered kill streaks, etc. If this game was $1, it would still be over priced. This game shouldn't even have the words ""Call of Duty"" on the cover. Treyarch really messed this one up"
1.0	This game bites!! The characters repeat the same stupid phrases every time you order them to do anything.  The gameplay is [bad], it is not strategy but more of a second person accomplish a set mission style game.  The ambushes always happen in the same places.  It is impossibly hard at times and if the main character (sgt lionsdale) gets killed, you have to start over at the beginning of the mission.  The other soldiers will not even return enemy fire unless you order them to first face the enemy and second open fire.  Don't buy this game, it [is bad] Horrible Horrible Horrible don't buy it
1.0	I bought this game thinking that it was a new sonic game, until i looked at the case and saw a fat guy with a red hat. I broke down in tears because i wasted money on this garbage. I WANT MY MONEY BACKK
1.0	Needs better help mode. One Star
1.0	"It's junk. Lasted about 3 days before half the keyboard went dead. Unplugged it, plugged it back in, it came back to life. The next day, the right half died completely, and for good.

Great keyboard if you like typing with your left hand only. Junk"
1.0	"rotten game; no control whatsoever; impossible to use online control manual

don't waste your money on this garbage true ripoff"
1.0	"This is not like the original Soldier of Fortune games.  Lame checkpoint save system that doesn't work correctly all of the time (i.e., you'll see multiple ""save game"" textual pop-ups, but if you die, you restart at the beginning of the level in my experience). Ridiculously unrealistic boss fights where 200+ rounds need to be dealt to a single man who isn't wearing body armor in order to ""kill"" him. A drastically toned down body dismemberment system (contrary to the advertising about this game being true to previous games in the way you can shoot parts of the enemy body off, while you ""can"" shoot pieces off, this isn't anywhere near as graphic as the previous SoF games were).  Irritating Doom 3-style enemy spawns in areas you've already cleared (i.e., on one level, you'll shoot a sniper out of a tower and as you advance over a bridge another sniper magically appears in the tower in his exact place and starts head shooting you...)

The level environments are very linear with little or no reward for attempting to explore out of the way areas and machine gun placements are poor and nearly unusable in their turn radius (i.e., in one part of a level, I grabbed a stationary machine gun hoping to mow down droves of enemies in a mindless one way fire fight and the tangos spawned so far to the left that the gun couldn't turn to actually shoot them...I had to unequip the mounted MG and switch to a scope-equipped weapon to take them down before they killed me).

A poor tribute to the SoF series is this and not worth more than $10.00 bargin bin price at that (IMHO). A poor tribute to the SoF series"
1.0	"So today's game market is pretty well if not over saturated with strategy games. With this being the case it makes sense that developers of the new comers learn from and improve based on titles that have been on the shelves. Obviously this logic doesn't follow through in the real world, enter Kingdom Under Fire.

Now although some of the sounds of battle are pretty well done, KUF leaves a generic after taste. swords clash with as much enthusiasm as a high school thespian take on Hamlet. Horses, arrows, trampling feet, all sound generic and uninspired. The final death blow to the sound quality comes from the voice acting. Dialogue feels cheap and meaningless between yawn inspiring battle charges and filler buster comments among characters.

The graphics have also suffered. Although character models look good form long range, animations and detail look childish at a closer glance. I simply can't say enough bad things about the animation. One such example is the way characters run through trees and obstacles, it looks more like they're running in place while the world moves around and shifts out of their way. Usually poor voice acting and graphics go hand in hand and KUF is no exception. Characters don't even speak their lines. Instead the programmers decided to have the characters constantly ""chew gum""  while the voice track is played. Even after they speak  the characters continue to do the chewing motion-is this level of programing really acceptable with the capabilities of the XBOX?

Gameplay quickly becomes boring no matter what the mission is. Battles mean mashing your troops into enemy troops with the ocassional support of varying soldier types. This does add a level of tactics to the game but not enough to compete-or even step in the same field as other strategy titles. The core of all battles is getting your character in the thick of the melee. The quickest and most efficient way to end these battles is by finding the commander of the enemy forces and quickly taking them out. Its a good idea but translates into a random chance on the battlefield as the commanders always look like the other enemies on the screen. You'll be lucky if you find them.

With everything said, Kingdom Under Fire is a title that adds no ambition to the RTS genre. All aspects of the game range from bland to mediocre and onward to generic. This title is obviously an attempt by programmers who love RTS' to get a foot hold on the genre; the reallity is that they should have stayed out or developed a more valiant effort. For those with computers running at a good  ability, there is an endless sea of RTS games. Sadly, Kingdom Under Fire throws in the towel to even the classics from the past decade. If you're curious, rent it. Otherwise pass it by on your way to a Blizzard or Sierra title. What Happened?"

1.0	"I picked up a Kinect and this came bundled with it. Like I said in the title, it's a nice technology demo for the Kinect but it's just not up to Xbox quality for gameplay. It's more like a weak Chuck E. Cheese attraction.
First off, it seems to need the maximum end of the living room size range. Even with one player I had to stand over 8 feet from the sensor. I nearly returned the Kinect because of this. I just don't have much more room than that in my play area and the box clearly shows 6 feet being OK.
Next, the game is just too slow to respond to movements. The handball game is WAY too slow, you have to hit the balls when they're half way down the court for them to track properly. The game where you dodge obstacles while on a raft track requires an irresponsible amount of side to side movement in a ridiculously short amount of time. Even my very athletic stepson couldn't keep up with it without running into walls and tripping and falling into the fireplace. Even when you do it right, it doesn't register your movement, so you have to jump twice as far and twice as high and do everything to the extreme.
If you're the average somewhat soft American and were thinking about buying a Kinect to be a little more active, don't. This game might kill you. ""Jocks"" only. I had very low expectations for the Kinect technology, and this game hits my expectations right on the head. It barely works and needs a massive living room area.
It does however, come with the demo for Joy Ride, which we enjoyed a bit more. It didn't require nearly as many extreme motions, but all the same, it still didn't feel quite as responsive as I'd like a game control to feel. Nice tech demo, needs polish."

1.0	"Hi guys
I bought the bf4 bundle with knack.
And I must say the graphics of the rendered trailers r insanely good.
The problem I got is a manufacturing error like a lot of u guys, which doesn't enable to plug in the hdmi cable in the port. It simply doesn't fit in ...
The support told me it's no problem they will change my console but they can't promise that the manufacturing error won't happen again.
Seriously I m considering to sending my console back and stick with my ps3. And probably in 1 year I will give the ps4 another go.
At the moment I can't recommend buying the ps4. It seems they could just reach this low price by lowering the quality of the new ps4.
For everyone who can't wait getting a next gen
Console I would recommend buying the wii u or waiting how good the xboxone is. Lower price, lowered quality?!"
1.0	"I waited over a decade for this game and I followed its progress from the days when I played Quake 2 on a dial-up modem. Now it has finally been released! The problem? DNF requires me to ""tie"" it to an e-mail address and prevents me from exercising my right to resell it if I think it doesn't live up to the wild promises that 3D Realms had made all those years.

Not only that, but what happens if the developers of Steam decide to close down in a few years? The game will be useless unless they patch it, which we have no guarantee of.

Also, there is no level editor or software development kit for the game. You see, back when PC games were worth buying, we got editing tools that allowed us to create custom levels and extend a game virtually infinitely. People still make DooM levels for example. Even Duke Nukem 3D came with plenty of editing tools on the disk.

If you simply must play this game, I recommend a console version. Then your game won't be tied to some online authentication system that will close down one day, probably making said game useless. You will also be able to trade the game in if you end up not liking it. Buyer beware, Game Requires Steam. Do Not Buy!"

1.0	First, this review is slanted because for some reason I thought Fallout was a FPF.  Well, it is not.  It's a role playing game.  I HATE RPG's!  But it is so boring I couldn't play it more than an hour.  The graphics sucks.  The character's movement is like a puppet on a string.  The limited action is zzzzzzzzz.  You have to shoot someone 5 times before they croak.  You have to look in EVERY nook and cranny to find things.  And then mostly all you get are empty boxes or a cup or a coffee pot.  You have to talk to EVERYBODY in order to find out what's going on and where you need to go to finish challenges.  The conversations are zzzzzzzzz and inane.  If you like that kind of thing knock youself out.  Just warning the people who like good graphics and action.  I had the original Fallout and I though it sucked.  I thought this was going to be better.  Same thing, slightly better graphics.  But just as lame. Dismal

Soddingly Worthless"
1.0	"When the game was first launched, it was filled with bugs and missing a lot of content (like land mounts, you had to run everywhere).  The bugs and lack of content gave the game a bad name right from the start, and it never recovered.

I started playing a few months later after most of the launch bugs had been worked out and new content had been put into the game. I really enjoyed it.  There were about 32 different classes/professions to choose from, and you could change them as often as you wanted to try new things.  I myself started doing ""entertaining"", then changed to an armorsmith and a combat profession.  You could have any combination you wanted.

Many people complained, as people tend to do, about combat class balances, and this and that.  Sony decided that trying to balance 32 classes/professions was just to much work, so they decided to group several professions into a few to make the job easier, or just flat get rid of some.  So came the ""CU"" (combat upgrade).  This was not taken well by many players, and several left the game.  I myself still found the game still playable, but not nearly as enjoyable.  I wanted to keep crafting, but now I was stricly a crafter, and could no longer engage in combat because I could not have more than one profession at a time.  I would find myself wondering the land being ""one-shot"" by every low level creature around.  I couldn't check my harvesters that collected the resources I needed without a few deaths.  I couldn't collect skins that I needed to craft since I could no longer kill anything.  Yet, it was still barely playable, so I stayed.

Sony, under pressure from Lucas Arts to make the game a success, hurried out yet another large change, that became known as the NGE.  What is really sad about this is how they went about it.  A new expansion was about to come out.  They advertised the heck out of that new expansion and started taking pre-orders for it, charging peoples credit cards for the expansion before it came out.  Two days after they started doing pre-orders for the expansion they announced the major NGE changes.  This upset most everyone who felt they had been tricked.

They also told players there were going to be changes to professions coming soon.  They had announced the first class to be changed, and told players what they planned to do with it.  If I remeber correctly, it was going to be a support class that wasn't played much, but I can't remember the name of it.  They were great ideas (like being able to stealth, and tons of others) and changes that the class had badly needed for some time.  Yet, here they were working on this NGE that would destroy the very class they claimed to be preparing to make major upgrades to.  It just seemed after the fact that Sony was just stringing along people to keep them around as long as they could.  After all, why would they be working to make major profession changes they knew were going to be pointless in just weeks?  Did one hand not know what the other hand was doing?

When the announcement of the NGE came, almost instantly you could log onto a test server to try it out for yourself and give feedback on it.  This was no normal test though.  They already had planned the release of the NGE to live servers in only like a week away, and were unwilling to change it with the Christmas shopping season coming.  You can't do a whole lot of testing and bug fixes in a week.  So, this was coming out one way or another, no matter what the player base had to say about it. And it was unusual how fast it was all happening.  They gave us a much longer heads up for the CU.

The funny part is no one could test it because the first thing you had to do was get on the Millenium Falcon, which was broken.  So, no one could get past that to even test the game for the first couple days.  But, by god it went live on time, regardless of whether it worked or not.

It was a nightmare.  Nothing worked when the NGE went live.  Sony defended it's actions and even lied.  They told the world that it had been eagerly accepted by players and that it was drawing in a large number of new players.  We knew better, but it took a long time before they admitted it.  I even watched a developer from the game go on G4TV to show what a great new change this all had been.  The host of the show who interviewed him basiclly called the players who were complaining whiners and crybabies.  The developer then showed something on the new and exciting game, and guess what, it didn't work because it was broken, but then played it off as if it worked as promised.  I don't know if they paid G4 for that interview, because it certainly wasn't unbiased.

It's amazing to look back at it all and see just how much went wrong.  They basicly showed the gaming world what not to do.  To bad they had to drag thousands of us along for the ride with so many empty promises and outright lies. It's really sad what this once decent game has become"
1.0	"So keyboards don't work at all with guitarcade, at least not on a Mac. For whatever reason once you enter guitarcade the keyboard quits recognizing input. Not even escape or cmd+option+delete.  I have to force quit it with cmd + q to get back to the main menu.  I have the same experience on a imac with a bluetooth keyboard, a logitec RF usb keyboard, and a straight up wired lenovo USB keyboard and a Macbook with its builtin keyboard. They told me ""laptops"" aren't supported, despite clearly having laptops (Macbooks specifically)  in almost all the promo materials for the game. Anyway, I submitted the issue on Ubisoft support and they replied telling me that they don't support controllers- they only support the microsoft Xbox 360 controller, and to go to Windows> control panel and update my drivers. Erm... is a keyboard a controller? Not sure. Regardless OSX doesn't have a windows button or a control panel and as far as keyboards go, doesn't use manually configurable drivers.

So I called them and asked. They said it's not a known issue and that I'd need to wait for engineers to receive a problem ticket and address the issue. Google ""rocksmith mac keyboard"" and you'll quickly realize that's not a one time issue but seems to affect ALL MACS. yes. All... Macs.... Everywhere. No controlling guitarcade for you.

I'm not really sure what to do to make it work other than wait several years for a class action suit. I asked about using a PS3 controller since 360 controllers aren't supported on Macs but PS controllers are. they said they only support 360 controllers. So... the ""Mac compatible"" sticker is actually more of a blatant case of fraud than it is a reality. Don't buy this for Mac. In fact, don't buy it  for PC either.. I can't even get it to open on my Lenovo laptop.\

If you check in and check their support page it says that ""laptop versions"" of the listed video cards aren't supported. what constitute's a laptop version?New iMac's use a geForce 750 M.. That falls under the 700 category but is technically a ""laptop version""Older  Macs use 600 versions which aren't supported at all.  The new Mac Pro's don't even use theATI  Raedon cards- they use ATI Firepro line. Technically the Firepro line should be pretty similar (identical) to the Raedon line but with some upgrades. Speaking in a strictly legal sense- that excludes ALL macs. iMacs and Macbooks use a ""laptop GPU"" Mac Pro's since 2013 don't even have the option of installing a second hand compatible GPU. Legally Ubisoft only supports a handful of 2012 Mac Pro's with a specific GPU & processor configuration.

I'm sorry but that's fraud sir. You can't say ""Mac compatible"" on the front and then quietly mutter ""but only 2012 mac pro's with a custom CPU and GPU configuration"" in legalese on the back. NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MAC"

1.0	"This is quite possibly the worst FPS I have ever played. Seriously, it's bad! There's no redeeming qualities! The story is awful(though the idea had potential), The voice acting is so bad it's painful. The animation and graphics are poor.

I really wanted to like this game. I love Wartime FPS games, zombie games and supernatural games. It sounded like my dream game. Turns out, it was my nightmare.

Honestly, I don't understand how this game managed to get such good reviews. It baffles the mind! Just....BAD!"
1.0	Graphics are good, gameplay sucks!! not enough moves or characters!!! Dont waste your money!!! Gameplay is way to easy!! i beat story mode in a weekend!! This game sucks
1.0	"Lets get this straight. I am a fan of Bethesda Games because of their uniqueness and unwillingness to follow the sheep. Every other review in here that is giving this game a 5 star rating are sheep and want nothing new exciting or different. The only reason I am giving this game 1 star is because of the gross over rating of this game. Nothing really new or improved. The graphics are better but this is the same story line and same background of almost ALL other shooters (good guy vs bad). So the visuals are different but this time Bethesda was lazy and decided that well we will add towns that you can build. BIG deal!?! so you spend most of your time running around ""problem solving"" for these settlements instead of doing what you want like explore. But you get helpers in this right? Not so much help as they interfere A LOT (getting in front of you in battle so you have no clear shot or worse your explosive that you just threw bounces off them and kills you, getting noticed when you are trying to sneak, STARTING a fight that you are trying to avoid, etc) As for being different nope same bad guys with very few new additions. Bad humans check, Ghouls check, Super Mutants check, Rad Scorpions check, Bloatflies check, Sentry Bots check, Blood bug (mosquitoes) check, Deathclaw check, new additions are synths (robot human) and Protectrons (badder robot human). One of the things I loved about Bethesda was their ability to think outside of the box and come up new and imaginative ways for the same things others had. In this game they followed the industry standard of ""same"". Let me explain. In almost every game no matter what the genre if you have the ability to level up, the bad guys/opponents level up with you. Bethesda really didn't follow this rule until this game and I was more disappointed in that than anything else. In this game there is really no reason to upgrade or level up at all. The base weapon in this game is a home made ""pipe pistol"" that shoots .38 caliber bullets. If it takes you 3 to 5 bullets to stop a ghoul for instance (one of the most common ""monsters"") the obvious solution is to get a bigger or more powerful gun right? So you do and the ghouls take 3 to 5  bullets to kill JUST like the base pipe pistol. So instead of coming up with something new (harder) for you to kill/beat they just level up the ""same"" things by giving it more hit points/power/speed. But you get more hit points when you level up right? So what when the bad guys can still take you down with just a few hits JUST like they did in the beginning. I can follow this logic up to a point but most games (98% or more) do this and it is just lame and lazy to boot. If they want to make a challenging game I am all for that but I challenge this whole brain dead industry to trial blaze again and throw out all the rules that you have written. Stop with the ""tried and true"" method as it didn't exist until you wrote it! Come up with NEW bad guys/cars/opponents. Come up with NEW ways to upgrade or level up. Give us a REASON to WANT to! NOT because that is the way all other games do it! As for the game itself this is just a rehash with some new characters and nothing really new or exciting. Same old formula from them AND the industry. So disappointing!"

1.0	"I won't bother to review this controller based on its features or capabilities, that's already been done.

Fundamentally, this controller doesn't work. The left analog stick will randomly ""stick"" or fail while playing games. The physical stick works great, but the game will react as if you are holding the stick in one direction when you have actually released it, or moved it in a different direction.
It does this intermittently and at random, and when it goes cock-eyed it may last for seconds or minutes. This made playing some games like Bioshock Infinite a bit of a challenge but not undoable. However a dual-stick shooter is impossible to play, unless your idea of playing a game is to play it like a retarded 4 year old.

I've updated the drivers (which are 3 years old), replaced batteries and re-calibrated it. Logitech support is, as usual, useless. You can search and find thousands of people reporting this problem and others.

This is a highly rated controller on Amazon for two reasons:
1) Cheap people who are more excited about the money they saved
2) Shills for Logitech I really want to like this, but it fundamentally sucks"
1.0	This game would be a lot better if it were campatible with the PS3 Wireless Les Paul controller that comes with the Guitar hero 3 game.  Very Disappointing. PS3 Players Beware
1.0	Very disappointed. This game promised dlc's but when I got the game, it was a used game and I was unable to use the codes for the dlc's because they had already been used. Very disappointed. This game promised dlc's but when I got ...
1.0	WARNING: This game DOES NOT have tag team mode in it (aka 2v2). There is no way to play WITH your friends in this game, only AGAINST them. Unlike Mortal Kombat 9 where you could play with your friends, you can only play 1 v 1 in Mortal Kombat X. DO NOT GET THIS GAME if you want it to play with other people, unless you like playing by yourself all the time. Cannot play with friends, only against them
1.0	I guess I've played worse flash computer games and maybe a couple old nes and super nes games that sucked more, but this was just a broken piece of trash. There have been so many game projects with great potential that have just been scrapped, and yet this actually made it to release... It even knows it sucks as you can skip any level you want...It's just garbage. Even the parts that seemed cool, were ruined by some glitch or another and it is just BROKEN. Worst 360 game. Ever.
1.0	"You play as a voodoo doll, named ""Voodoo Vince"", your mission is to rescue the vodoo priestess who got kidnapped (she is your owner). As a voodoo doll, you have power to inflict injury to your enemies by first causing injury to yourself (of course). you can perform special voodoo attacks when you collect enough magic orbs (from defeated enemies). It's just a standard platformer game once you get past the novelty. You can do your basic spin attack, jumps, grabbing onto ledges and floating. The graphics are nice and have a deformed look to it, adding to the wacky atmosphere of the game. The sound effects and music, were good, but very repetative. The controls were okay. The game gets difficult fast, and will give younger players a hard time. Since younger players are the target audience I think it was a mistake to make the game this hard. The game is also very short and very linear.
Pros:
+good graphics
+good controls
+voodoo doll powers
+funny
Cons:
-very difficult gameplay
-weak sound effects
-repetative music
-very short game
-linear gameplay
-difficult puzzles
-nothing innovating
-dark looking levels
-awkward camera
There are lots of better platformer games out there. Voodoo Vince is not one of them. Booyah"
1.0	"People, i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game. This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window. The games has most of the characters(whoopie...)which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring. I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay. If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is. Avoid this nerf dung at all costs. what, i have to give this ""game"" one star?!"
1.0	"I am regretting that I bought this mouse before reading the reviews on it. It is a HUGE MISTAKE to waste $53 on it. I have met with the same problems as others have.

First, the mouse has a bad design on the right side buttons. These buttons are locating at the place where you put your ring finger. It is hard to move the mouse in a game without miss clicking on these right side buttons. The other choice is to put your ring finger on the top side, and only use your thumb and your pinky finger to grab the mouse and control. This way is very uncomfortable for a DOTA 2 gamer like me, the mouse if full of my sweat after a 15 min game-play.

Second, the right click button is tough!!!! I was using a Logitech G302(Daedalus Prime) before this Taipan. Compared to G302, this right click button is trash. It is never easy to click during fast moving because the button is just as inferior as the ones on those cheap mice which are less than $10.

Last, the sensor that Razer put inside this Taipan is SO STUPID. The sensor wants to make users ' feel slippery and hints of random acceleration '. However, it comes out that the mouse has a several milliseconds delay on the beginning of every move, which let you feel like the acceleration system is ON. This is definitely a FAILURE DESIGN since for every mouse user, they definitely expect the mouse movement to be a hundred percent under control. We do not need ANY RETARDED FEELING from the hardware or software.

For me, this mouse is a TOTALLY FAILURE DESIGN and worth nothing. Never buy this mouse, A STUPID DESIGN FAILURE,"
1.0	"If you were unsure if the acquisition of bioware by EA would affect the quality of game they put out, here's your answer. I have played bioware games since KOTOR and have yet to see them put out a such a steaming, bug filled pile as this. If you told me that the extent of their testing this game was one quick play through by some random junkie, who had never played an RPG, and was stoned out of his mind the whole time, I'd believe you. There is a glitch where the player character's attack speed gets progressively slower and slower. Thus turning fast paced button slapping action into an unbearably dull and exceedingly frustrating affair. I hear that this glitch is made worse by being a mage, which I was. I had to replay hours of the game to undo the slowdown only for it crop back up over and over until I gave in. My friend who has this game as well was a mage and was unable to avoid the glitch. He ended up selling the game without finishing it. It is said that you can slow down so much that your character will no longer attack at all. *<*< THIS GLITCH IS CONFIRMED ON ALL PLATFORMS! IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY TO UPDATE THE GAME VIA BROADBAND INTERNET, I WOULDN'T BOTHER BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE GETTING 20 HOURS INTO A GAME ONLY TO HAVE IT RUINED BY A GLITCH. EVEN IF YOU DO I'D WAIT TILL THEY PUT OUT A PATCH<*<*  You can read more on the details of this else where on the Internet. Also there is a vertical stretch on the sprites during the cut-scenes that flickers on and off randomly. Once more the kind of thing that testing easily reveal. There's a lot of other glitches I won't get into. All the major review sites don't seem to mention the game breaking slow glitch but, hell screw the hand that feeds you, just take there $60 and give them a turd. I could talk about the lack of central plot or the fact that you can just barely read the text without an HDTV(20/20 vision, with 46"" TV) or the obscured fashion side quests are presented (how fun to go into the start menu over and over) but, their obvious lack of adequate testing is obtusely more present in my experience of this game. Thanks for a game that left me pissed off enough to waste more time writing this review.  An OK game that is ruined by Glitches <<*"
1.0	The game has the potential to be fun, but BUYER BEWARE!  There are currently a number of huge bugs in this game...most notably, the game will without warning corrupt your save files, forcing you to start over from the very beginning.  One patch has already been released, but it did not address this issue or a number of other terrible problems.  Insomniac Games is promising a 'big patch' to fix a number of these problems, but it has been two months and nothing has been done yet.  My advice is, if you really want this game at least wait until around February when they may have fixed the many problems with it...and then you might find it in used form much cheaper.  If you insist on getting it now, good luck, but you'll likely find yourself forced to start from zero when the game crashes on you. Avoid this game until they release the next patch!
1.0	this device sucks! unlike the actualy wii senser bar it can not conect at all it seems i bought this for my wii emulator i could not connect to it from 5 feet away no response at all
1.0	"i don't think i've ever actually despised a game prior to playing Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow 2. getting from point a to point b is always way more of a hassle than it has any reason to be. what passes for puzzles are more often walking around in circles for 5 minutes trying to find the next counter-intuitive step in the linear path you're following. the game never settles on a particular set of mechanics so finding the solution to the next roadblock is rarely something your previous gameplay experience will help with. i think that's the biggest problem with the game, just the feeling of starting over every few minutes. never building any knowledge that can be put to any use. never any sense of learning how to better interact with the game world.
the combat is the same. you have block and dodge options but trying to use them will usually result in you taking more damage then if you just spam your way through. many enemies have unblockable attacks and to dodge them you need to stay too far away to ever be able to land a hit. there's no sprint option and you move so slowly that even if you bait and dodge an attack by the time you get close enough to hit the enemy again they're already beginning their next attack.
the only way to refill your magic bars consistently is to make the journey to go find the wolf and follow him through long load screens to the refill station and then back again which seems like a conscious effort to cram more timewasting tedium into the game. the heal statues are scarce and always in the most useless places. there usually isn't one after a boss or other tough battle. the pain boxes scattered throughout the game world will allow you eventually increase your health and  magic bars by the most uselessly miniscule amount somewhere around the halfway point of the game if you find enough of them. the process of mastering skills to eventually upgrade a weapon is so impractical that when i finally quit the game 75% of the way through i still hadn't got to find out whether it got enough of a damage increase for it to be worth the effort.
the cutscenes are slow paced and repetitious. it would have been nice to be able to skip through the mostly redundant dialogue line by line rather than have to choose between skipping or enduring the whole thing.
the one positive thing i can say about the game is it's the first game i've seen give you a menu option to disable quicktime events. headline for your review"
1.0	I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game.  I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts.  It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys.  Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well, it was hard to locate where you were going, unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City.  Unfortunately, the writers expected us to know as well. A terrible injustice to a longstanding icon.
1.0	I really wanted to like this game, I loved the first DA, but it turned out to be like torture for me.  I played about 10% of the game before I gave up, I just couldn't take it anymore.  The story is incredibly lame, the characters you want to delete after the first meeting, ie. they suck, and the gameplay is not very good.  What the heck happened between the first game, which was great, to now is a mystery, but they definitely screwed the pooch on this one. Bad
1.0	"If you're looking to buy this for A game other than Rush the Rock then don't mind my review...otherwise, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! I bought this for Rush the Rock and was very excited when I received it, fired it up in my PS2, Selected Rush the Rock, was excited when it loaded, then was very, VERY shocked, As far as I know, they've replaced about every single sound effects, music, and Announcer, the Announcer from the arcade version got replaced with A NEW ONE! They even killed the ""What's your name?!"" Song, so overall If you're looking to buy this for any game other than Rush the Rock then go ahead otherwise don't buy this. Bought this game for Rush the Rock and very disappointed."

1.0	"I will start with the most frustrating part of this game and nitpick from there.
While playing, my character will battle groups of enemies.  Often the camera will decide to start spinning itself into an awkward view.  As you attempt to correct this view, since the same button for moving the camera is the switch target button, my character will spin completely around and target archers, trolls, random npcs in the distance instead of the enemies hitting me in the face at that very moment.  Also, when I actually manage to kill one of the enemies in these groups that I am locked onto, my character will not unlock on the target until he is finished laying down half the time, even though the enemy is dead.  This leads to my character leaning over and smacking the floor a couple times, placing the back of my neck in perfect position for the other enemy's axe cleave.  Since the execution style beheading appears to line up so perfect, so many times, I am unsure whether this was actually unintentional.  The game is not so much hard as having the controls a jumble of madness that can't be edited.  Perhaps on PC, the game would be better since you could hopefully edit this.  I've found the best way to actually defeat groups of enemies is just run off, and the ones at the back of the group will decide to abandon their brave leader to run back to their spawn locations.
When you have an enemy locked on and said enemy falls down, a minigame begins that attempts to see how close your character can swing his blade at the enemy without actually hitting them, kind of like the knife game from Aliens.
When you spend all the time to gather souls, it is then time to level up.  Each time you want to level your character, you have to teleport back to the main camp, speak to a certain character, that lacks a short term memory.  Therefore each time you must have to button through 4 lines of delayed dialog, to get to a menu to level up.  Sometimes this character decides that their spiel is not long enough and decides to be sitting down.  This would not be a problem if the character rose up faster than the old lady at the front of the airplane.
Do you like having an easy way to compare the equipment you might buy to the equipment you are currently using?  So do I!  I hear it might be available as a DLC.
Do you like opening chests?  Good luck being able to with the 5 messages in front of it saying chest.
This game appears to confuse being hard with frustrating. Targeting system is terrible, have to skip through talking just to level a character, no way to compare equipment before buying"
1.0	"Buyer beware : You have to have a constant internet connection just to start the game. And you have to log in everytime you start it up.

1.0	"Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided

*Sigh* Where to begin...

This game could be better named:
""Star Wars Galaxies: A Development Team Vs. A Player base"".

Never in all my life, have I seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's truly sickening. I WAS a 20-month veteran of the game, I had been playing since week one (I've canceled my account and will NEVER do business with SOE again!).

*Wave Hand* ""This is not the game you are looking for... Move along!""

PLEASE, READ ON...

In the beginning...
This game was alright; it was fun, it was unique, and it was totally bug-ridden and unbalanced. Over the course of the last 20 months, the SOE Dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game. They in fact did very little, if anything at all. They milked us. They exploited the ""Star Wars"" name to make a buck. They made promise after promise after promise... and never delivered squat. Don't believe me? Just ask any ""Smuggler"" in the game for their opinion.

They strung us along and led us to believe that the ""fixes"" to the game were right around the corner! Instead, they were hard at work on an ""Expansion Pack"" to sell us! And then once again ""promised us"" that the fixes we've all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us, ""just hang on, this game is going to be great!"" They promised us that they were going to do this ""Combat Upgrade"" and do it right, and it ""wouldn't be released until it's ready!""

We all had a lot of hope, we thought that they had finally figured out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse. God, how wrong we all were...

Well, much to everyone's surprise, they made the announcement that the long awaited ""CU"" would be coming out along with the ""Rage of the Wookiees"" expansion pack! Uhhhmmm... did I miss something somewhere? The alpha test for the ""CU"" was supposed to begin in January, it never happened. Beta testing began in April, 4 whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live! We all rolled up our sleeves and dove in. I think after the first week or so, the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink in...

They went and copy/pasted EQ2 code into the SWG game so they could ""streamline"" their operation by having ONE DEV TEAM WORK ON BOTH SWG AND EQ2!!!

The CU was supposed to go live on May 5th. SOE decided to push it to live a whole 2 weeks sooner than that. Honestly, with all the bugs that were still in beta, and now in live, beta could have gone on another 4-6 months! I guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it. Why am I not surprised?

The CU itself is unplayable. It has become Everquest in space, or ""EverStar Galaxies QuestWars"" as we call it. There are just too many things to list. I'm sure a lot of other reviews here go into much more detail.

As you all can imagine, the player community was totally enraged! We went to the SWG Forum boards to voice our concerns. The only response we ever got back from SOE was THOUSANDS of deleted threads and players banned from the forums. Facing futility, a large portion of the player base has left the game, permanently this time.

This is just not how you do business. I personally will NEVER deal with Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) EVER again. I DO NOT pay MY HARD EARNED MONEY to be lied to, deceived, ignored, strung along, censored, and banned for voicing my concerns. I do not pay money to folks who treat me, a PAYING CUSTOMER, in this fashion.

Star Wars Galaxies is dead. Servers are emptying. People are moving on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons. If you are a fan of Star Wars, and this is the only reason I ever started playing this game to begin with, you will be sadly disappointed!

SWG is nothing more than an exploit of a title, a milk machine. I for one, am tired of being milked.

You have been warned! A SERIOUS WARNING about SWG and SOE from a WEEK ONE VETERAN!"
1.0	"This game had a lot of potential and an enticing storyline.  Unfortunately the developers and/or the publisher didn't bother to playtest the game in the real world.  Go read the support forums on Splash Damage or Bethesda and you will see one problem after another.

This game was advertised as a great multi-player and co-op FPS.  Unfortunately me and my friends can't get the networking settings (which are NOT documented except by fellow gamers on the support forums) to actually enable online play.  I have over a dozen other online games that play just fine so the problem is with Brink.  Menawhile, the game crashed several times while we were trying different settings for co-op play.  Basically, the build quality is sub-par and the developers don't deserve your hard-earned money.

My favorite DSs are Cake Mania, Diner Dash, Touchmaster - I thought this would be similar but it's not. Not what I expected"
1.0	The game uses an atb like system much like legend of heroes a tear of vermilion but with combination attacks.  The art, characters and writing was all good from what I played of it.  However because the game is very glitchy I can't rec this. Fun but flawed experience prevents this from being a decent game

1.0	WWE Smackdown vs RAW 2008  For PS 2 is a very disappointing game. I found what ruined the game for me was how they changed the controls and made them harder. I had trouble executing moves as they were difficult to make. I recommend you get PS 2 Smackdown vs Raw Original, Here Comes The Pain and Shut Your Mouth. I found those games to be easier and more enjoyable to play. Review For PS 2 Game: Hard Controls Ruin The Game
1.0	this game is not great or even good. You can tell that the game is rushed and is missing the sheer basics of any FPS style game. Just wanted to let you all know to save your money, unlike me. Now i'm stuck with a $60 game that's not worth it and i can only get a small piece of my money back, so sad, so so sad :.( terrible game with too much hype
1.0	Controller is defective. It activates the home button and the start button on its own. This thing is made of complete garbage materials. Very flimsy plastic. Microsoft again going cheap. Sending it back garbage.
1.0	"You know that video on all the Razer products with the dancing lights synced with the song? This is not that mouse. That mouse is the Mamba Chroma. I returned this product.

Otherwise worked, but EXTREMELY false advertising.

Really Razer? A video on a product page showing another product that has features and abilities not associated with the product at hand?
Dick move. Ignore the video, doesn't apply to this mouse."
1.0	Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is bar none the worst game tied to a movie license that I've ever played. The graphics are drab and lifeless, the controls are clunky, and the missions are boring and tedious. The game's only saving grace is the plethora of unlockables (CG in-game movies, theatrical clips, behind the scenes clips, stills, etc.) available to you as you progress through the game as well as a playable demo of a much better, currently unannounced, terminator game called T3: Redemption. There were times when I found myself playing the demo rather than the actual game itself. In it, you play as Arnold from a third person perspective as you blast away cyborgs and HK's on foot or on vehicle through a nuclear-scorched Los Angeles. This was the game that I should have been playing, not the rushed hack job I got instead. For die-hard fans, save you money till T3: Redemption comes out. Rise of the Machines by itself, is just an expensive demo. Just a hideous game...
1.0	Worst Metal Gear game ever. I've been a huge MGS fan since the original Metal Gear games on the NES, and this one shouldn't even be considered a game. It's a short Demo that is not worth anything over $5. Short Demo not worth anything over $5.
1.0	"The visuals are great, but the game-play is laughable. There is less linearity in Monkey Island II! You just follow through a linear storyline, dying as many times as you need and just respawning so you keep trying until you blunder your way through.

It would have been better if they'd just made it into a ""straight to DVD movie"" that I could have rented at RedBox for a buck.

And then you try to play online, start off as a private and get killed within the first 10 seconds every time, in what amounts to a visually glorious, but ultimate less rewarding activity (for the over 30-something casual game player) than Team Fortress 2. Which is what this old-time gamer is going to keep on doing.

How on earth this so-called ""game"" made ""game of the year"" against something creative, playable, and strategically superior such as Bioshock, I'll never understand.

I must be getting old. Linear, repetitive, and a waste of money."
1.0	"Why does this game download not tell you that Steam is required???? If I'd have known I'd spend the past 1/2 hour trying to recover a Steam account I used 2 years ago and then spend four hours downloading Steam required updates, after downloading a 7.1 gb file, before I can even launch the game, I'd have saved my money.

Please let us know if the downloads are Steam required, so those of us who absolutely hate Steam can avoid them. Steam????!!!"
1.0	COD was a great franchise, but there's just nothing left for them to do. Same boring stories, same old gameplay. Same Old, Same Old
1.0	"I purchased this item as a case for my PSP 3000. The case seemed to have positive reviews, so I trusted the other reviewers opinion of the item.

When I received the item, opened the packaging, I realized that I couldn't get the case open. I attempted to apply all the force I could with my hands to get it open without outright breaking it. After contacting the seller, Videgamesdiva, I was told that this was spec stock and that I should try to open it, if it broke, I would be issued a refund.

So, I got out a metal flat head screw driver, applied a sizable amount of prying force and was able to get the case open.

The main issue is the screen protector. First off, if the screen isn't in its locked position, the case WILL NOT CLOSE without damaging your psp, so it must be locked. When it's locked, it's jammed and can't be opened without some sort of metal prying tool.

After prying it open the first time, I decided to give the case a second chance, placed my psp inside, locked the screen protector in place and closed the case. Yet again, the case was jammed shut and I was unable to open it with my bare hands. I had to use a metal flat head screw driver to get my psp out safely.

I did a little research on Sony's forums, I found many others had the same issue with this item. I'm currently waiting on a reply from Videogamesdiva, and I'll follow up to their reply to better inform the rest of you as to whether you should do business with them.

I wouldn't accept this product for free and I would highly recommend going with a different case. I plan on buying a different case and I'll try to post that here as well. Do not purchase! This case could potentially damage your PSP!"
1.0	"It's a product of steam & I am only permited to play when steam decides I can.  That means if your internet connection is ever severed or the server is down you cannot play this game,  If you ever decided to cancel your internet service this video game goes along with it.  Also, don't try to sell this thing or buy it used as steam won't allow any other user to play this .

It's good to know a corporation is allowed to have so much authority and power over a product we buy with our own money. I bought this game but I don't really own it."
1.0	Flight Simulator 2002 is a good game but when you fly the planes you do nothing. You just end up crashing because theres  nothing to do in the game. One plane won't even get off the ground. I don't know why they put that plane in the game. Not fun
1.0	"I really REALLY wanted to like this game. I saw the commercials with the sharp graphics and witty funny dialogue and thought 'This is going to be a great game' right?WRONG!And I am sorry to say this. Now,I play a lot of first person shooter games and some are better than others obviously. But I've never played one that had so much promise and failed in almost every concievable way possible. Now,before I get to the terrible parts let me start with the very few positive available.

Lets start off with the graphics. They are very realistic and you'll be surprised great they are. The best I've seen in a game of this type so far. The duel acessories/weapon selection is cleaver. You can repair any vehicle pretty fast with a rivot-type gun which is useful. And the dialogue the men in Bad Company during the campaign is actually pretty funny and comedy is certainly a nice change of pace in a game about war and death. And the coolest part of the game is actually firing the Artillery pieces with a airial view a lot of fun especially online.

Now,here comes the bad parts which are considerable so bare with me through all of them. Let's begin on the game mechanics. Selecting weapons are cumbersome and awkward. You'll shuffle through one only to realize that you skipped it. And you would think that the standard L1-R1 weapon select system would have been more than adequate to easily get the job done,but L1 selects the acessories and R1 selects weapons. Secondary weapons like a attached grenade launcher should be on L2 and use R2 to fire,but disappointingly enough it's an acessory so you have to select it with L1 which is more than awkward especially in the heat of battle. The reticles are almost useless and is hard to guage if you even have your target on it and the recoil moves it around so much you easily lose track of the enemy. Rocket Launchers are underpowered especially up close where they shoulb be the most effective like hitting a guy in the chest and him not dyingAnd a lot of the weapons you use online and unlockable ones you need special codes and they are extremely hard to get and then even more can only the be unlocked only if you'd pre order the game LAME!

Now to the campaign-The story is the backbone to any first person shooter and without one severely dilutes the online part which it does a lot. The whole concept is about finding enemy Gold and smuggling it out so everyone there can retire. Although this sounds like this is a great idea and a novel concept it's actually becomes stale and boring very quickly. Like I said I had no problem with the voice acting,but some may find it to be dumb and repetitive. Also,the intro just throws you into a Russian-type country without any backstory or explanation on how and why you are there which is the biggest flaw in the game. A good portion of the enemy A.I. even on the highest difficulty are dumb and are easy targets.

And finally Online-There are only two settings(Gold Rush and Conquest mode).And you can only get Conquest Mode only if you download it off of XBOX Live and please do it's head over shoulders better that playing Gold Rush by far. There is absolutely to talking in this game which I found wierd in a game so strategic as this one. At first I thought my Mic was broken,but then soon discovered after playing several consecutive games that there's simply isn't any at all. This might be a good thing however,because there is a lot of Team Killing that occurs. And I do mean a lot of it. This was preveilent in the first Battlefield game,but no where near the level that it is now. The HUD is useles as well. It doesn't show you where your team is at accurately and enemies appear as little tiny dots that you can barely see. But you don't have to worry much about this,because Snipers rule this game. You'll get picked off from a thousand yards away and have no idea what happened until it's too late. And don't ever EVER get into a vehicle especially a Helicopter with your Teammates around,because they will deliberately shoot at you until you die or the vehicle is rendered completely useless. Most players also have better weapons available that you do and if you're up against them you might as well leave the game. You only have about five maps to play on and only two of those are worth playing. The are big a bit too big and although you can select which spawn point you select,by the time you get into the battle the actual fighting is now a thousand miles away from you and you'll find yourself running or driving to the front lines.

Overall this game is a big disappointment. If you expect a great game you'll be sadly mistakened. I lay all the blame on the makers of the game who should have realized all of these problems and actually fix them. They deserve a special award for poor game design and flawed unsupervised online game play. And a thrown together jumbled mess of a story line. I could actually go on with more problems with the game,but that would drag this review even further. If you have to play this game I suggest you rent it,DO NOT buy this game! It's a waste of time and money. To finish all I have to say is this game might very well be the biggest disappointment of any video game and any genre I've ever seen and I hope I have given you all the information you need to avoid such a dreadful game as this one turned out to be. Battlefield Bad Game!"
1.0	"Despite the highly impressive introductory scene and menu screen, don't be deceived.  This game is far too conventional and undeniably sloppy.  Terrible low quality graphics and messy animation, lifeless paper diorama-like environments, corny cliched looped background 'noise' which fails to evoke a dark, haunting atmosphere.  The controls can become extremely confusing and frustrating in times of crisis (plenty of mutilation, blood spillage and cleavage wobbling though).  The characters are in many ways stereotyped and dull yet cheaply sexy and appealing (in the busty exotic bombshell type way - a cross between Elvira and Mortal Kombat's Sonya Blade).
The concept and storyline (or lack of) is shallow and focuses more on show-casing stereotypical gothic style, lacking substance and depth.
It's a shame, this game potentially could've been much better.  It certainly doesn't do justice for the X-box either...  It's still an appealing short-lasting novelty like playing old platformers for nostalgic value.  It's fun and wasteful but certainly not for those who want a worthwhile challenge. Actually '1-1/2' stars."
1.0	Not a fan of runescape. It was a free gift download from something or another. If you like Runescape by all means, this is for you. But for me, not a fan. If you like Runescape by all means
1.0	"This game is boring .the volleyball is just way too weak to keep your attention for more than a few hours.
  the girls are beautiful but they all speak japanease(which really gets annoying). its more of a game of dress up the ultra hot dolly than a volleyball game.the most nudity in the game is the thong bikinis that you can make them wear.
  The casino is also quite boring youve got poker,blackjack and a host of similar slot machines.
  The consensus between me and everyone i have let use or play this game is that the chicks are hot but how long can you look at a pixelated hottie before you realize the game has no substance. this game stinks"
1.0	IM sorry to say I have to give a bad rating because the game just would not play as if it were blank the company would do well to check the games before they sell them if I didn't test or check things before I work on my clients I would lose clients. Also I threw away the bag thinking there was no need for it so I couldn't return it and my kid was really upset. PLEASE test you Games before Selling Sheesh! THE GAME DIDNT WORK ITS BLANK
1.0	These type of games I normally love to death but this one's controls, horrid game play, cheap enemies and beat em up style I do not care for what so ever, this is a very poor game. Normally I would love this.
1.0	I couldn't stand this game. This was NOTHING compared to S of R and S o R 2. The gameplay was super fast and it was alot harder too. The soundtrack in this game was totally lame. Once again,NOTHING compared to the first two games of the trilogy. The characters you choose from are about the same. Except there is no Adam again(which sucks big time) and no Max Thunder either(which REALLY sucks) All there is,is some old dude who is a human-robot or something. I don't even know what the hell this thing even is. Anyway,the graphics are about the only good thing that I would say this game's got going for it. Overall,I would recommend avoiding this one,and just pick up Streets Of Rage and Streets Of Rage 2. Just buy the first two games and leave this one alone.
1.0	"Its a shame I'm bothering to mention a thing about the game.  Its garbage and its recycled garbage at that- the most economical kind (read as: exploitable kind for publishers).  The story is literally broken.  Everything ended after Bioshock presumably with you saving the little sisters or not- everyone is dead you survived- end of story.  Their is no reason to bridge a gap here, none at all.  I've heard rumors about the DRM on the PC version and being an owner of the first game (as well as system shock 1 for DOS and System shock 2) it irked me to some degree that an active connection was required to ""play"" the game I ""payed"" money to own.  Their is no logic here- I ""pay"" for services like cable because I do not own a server warehouse and am not my own internet provider.  So naturally if i buy a product made for a purpose (like a video game or movie) I now am the owner of said product period.  Why should their be the need to ""activate"" a product you've bought?  What if they started doing this with movies, e-books, and cd's?  What would be the general reaction to this?  Probably betrayal and after playing what I had already of Bioshock 2 on a friends PC I'm inclined to say that it was made to turn a buck or two.  Even worse is that its security methods are even more disturbing and riding the line somewhere between retail and digital distribution.  That's a dangerous place to be right now for us ""the consumer"" who can easily keep greedy men from getting paid at all.  Simply don't subscribe to the method and don't pay for the insult. Don't let 2K screw you over."
1.0	I know there are some out there who enjoy this game, but I had to chime in on them and spoil the fun a little (for the sake of those who might spend $20 on this game).  First of all, the game is targeting teenagers with it's graphics.  The cover shows two young children with mom and dad playing the game and having a fun time.  Nobody looks like that when they play this game, LOL.  The interface is very poor.  While this could be a game that builds critical thinking - it wouldn't be for young children AT ALL.  Maybe my husband and I could play this without the kids... maybe a teenager would enjoy this, but the cover implies something totally different.  Last, but not least, my daughters (ages 9 and 10) were disgusted with the suggestive body language of the female characters and their looks.  Really, it looks like something made by MTV - graphic wise. Bad Advertisement is the Culprit
1.0	"I absolutly love the DDR Series, but I just couldn't get into this one. I didn't like the music and the ""story mode"" was the most boring and terrible unlock mode in any of the DDR games I've played. Worst DDR game ever"

1.0	"I typically know what I'm doing when it comes to electronics.  And messing this up would have been hard for anyone, since it's a matter of connecting the charging cable from your PS3 to the device.  Which is what I did.  The Blue light in the device would light up, but the charging indicators on the controller never came on.
I have returned this product, and ordered an energizer branded charger at twice the price.  Hope that works since the next logical step is for me to stop being a cheapskate and just buy Sony's official PS3 charger for $40.

The instructions were horrible, but it's on par with the poor quality I expect from suspiciously inexpensive electronics.  They even said ""If the four indicator lights of the PS3 controller show no response, it means this charge station is defective.""  It's pretty telling when the manufacturer tells you the device could potentially be defective.  Actually, all the instructions are pretty succinct, let me give you the full text below.  Line #4 under ""function"" cracks me up!  And I have NO clue what RESET button they're referring to on line #3 of ""Using Steps.""

Function:

1.  The dual charging station for Sony PS3 controller is used to charge controllers of PS3 game console.

2.  Two controller grips can be charged at the same time.

3.  This charge station can be used with a PS, PS3 Console, or any USB charger (5V output) using a USB cable.

4.  This charge station has beautiful and exquisite appearance, convenient to furnish and use.

Using Steps:

1.  Turn on the power of PS PS3 Console, or any USB charger.

2.  Get this charge station connected with the USB port.

3.  Plug PS3 Controllers to this charge station and press the ""RESET"" to power on.

4.  Wait for 3-5 seconds until the four indicator lights of the PS3 controllers glisten simultaneously.  It means PS3 controller is being charged.  If the four indicator lights of PS3 Controller show no response, it means this charge station is defective.

Attention:

The maximum charging current is 300MA, when two PS3 Controllers are being charged at the same time; the maximum charging current is 420MA. Defective and the instructions warned me it could have been."

1.0	This game is garbage. It is one of the most boring games I have ever played. Terrible controls, garbage story, terrible glitchy online gameplay. Terrible, Just Terrible....
1.0	NES is the best ever, SNES was great but N64 for me had no games that were nearly as memorible.  I enjoyed Doom 64, WCW/NWO games, MK Trilogy, Goldeneye, Banjo Kazooie and thats about it but again nothing really memorible.  The grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and I have no desire to play the N64 but I still play NES to this day. Nintendo's weakest system

1.0	I usually love Racing Games...I absolutely hate this one!  It's not because of the races it is the colors that are so bright that you can hardly focus on anything else.

A few new weapons but nothing to cream at. The vehicles don't upgrade and change as u increase your driving skills like the old one did. The zombies are EXTREMELY easy to kill. Even the biggest, baddest zombies go down with a couple of punches. After 1 hour of gameplay you have pretty much played the whole game, youll be dong the samething over and over and over. disappointed

1.0	"NO FUN! POOR QUALITY!

I was really excited to use the saber accessory with my recent purchase of Star Wars the Force Unleashed. I played the game for a bit first and then opened up these sabers to add to the fun. WRONG!

The saber felt kind of cool in my hand at first but there are so many moves that the Force Unleashed game calls for that don't work with the long sword - seems to get in the way a little. Then add the quality issues and you have a real stinker.

I noticed that the color was simply clear plastic wrapped around the extending plastic tube that creates the ""light saber"" asthetic. The clear, colored plastic was scotch taped together to form fit the tube and flew off every time I swung the saber. Worse, it wasn't even wrapped evenly making it feel cheaper and less fun. Without color the saber looked like a white plastic tube and was even more disappointing.

Then, to try and salvage ANY fun I added batteries for the light-up effect. Both sabers didn't respond in any way to brand new batteries. I attempted to install them in every possible combo and it just didn't light up.

It was a sad experience all the way around and I would recommend that people stay far from these toys. NO FUN! POOR QUALITY! Poor quality spoils the fun!"

Well, SONY RUSHED the console, to release it BEFORE the XBOX ONE, that's why so MANY PS4 CONSOLE are FAULTY, BUGGY AND CRAPPY!

1.0	"The graphics of this game are its only strong suit. You will not be able to enjoy them because the game play of this title is completely busted. I don't understand the high praise at all and wonder if I accidentally got the wrong game included inside my case.

You are tasked with killing people, but you first have to search them out through the city. Easy right? Wrong. The cities are MASSIVE and you have to do various menial tasks in order to find clues that will lead you to the person. Ok, that acceptable too and had it stopped there, this might have been a different review.

But no, you are not allowed to step foot into the city because everyone knows who you are (I've heard of this thing called a disguise... but not Alistar or whatever your name is. Its set so far back in time maybe disguises weren't invented yet). So to blend in with the crowd you will have to play frogger and walk around endless swarms of people who just walk the streets all day and night. Collide with a single one and they will start shouting at you and the guards will run over and kill you. (Remember- if you bump into someone on a crowded subway you sure as hell better prepare to fight for your life against the police, you rapist.) Anyway, the only way to avoid people is to constantly walk around holding ""A"" which makes you put your head down (in shame as the developers of this ""game"" should) and walk at a snail's pace.

However you will still have to content with constant beggers who will walk in front of you (nobody else!) and harass the hell out of you and make you walk even SLOWER. But you can't even give them money to get them off your back! You just have to contend with them! Also for unknown reason there are also people balancing jars on their heads and trying to walk the crowded streets. If you touch them (and they seem to follow you to!) they will drop their jars and the guards will rush over and attack you.

That seems to be the conclusion for everything in this game, walk to fast - a guard will kill you, bump into someone - the guard will kill you, stable your horse outside the town but have the crappy AI make the horse STILL follow you and have it trample someones store while you are IN THE CITY - a guard will come and kill you. Climb up a wall- a guard will see you (or even be waiting on the roof!) and kill you. Stay out of the mob fest that is the town and just ride your horse through the plains trying to find anything good about this god forsaken game) - and a guard will be randomly posted in the middle of nowhere and kill you.

Overall, if it isn't obvious I HIGHLY recommend that you STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. It is HORRIBLE and I have no idea how it is a Player Choice game. It is innovative yes, and the story seems to be really good (though I only was able to experience 2 chapters or so before rage quitting) but the gameplay is mediocre. Absolutely mediocre and frustrating to the point of screaming at the game.

Perhaps the newer versions are better (AC II or Brotherhood) but I will never know because I refuse to buy another title from this series. The real assassination happened to my wallet when I shelled out $20 bucks for this. Someone KILL ME! Someone kill me, this is not fun at all"
1.0	The controller is nice, very much like the real xbox controller, however big problem I ran into with this thing, the directional pad is stiffer than the nipples on a manikin, if they had nipples that is. It is so unresponsive, trying to play side scrollers or a game that utilizes the directional pad is beyond unbearable. You literally have to use the entire force of your thumb muscles in order to get some feed back from this thing. I don't know  if you guys will get a hit or miss if you are looking to purchase this controller. It sucks because I really wanted to like this controller too. :(. Pretty spiffy and all so stiffy
1.0	"after renting this game to my dismay i found ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING new or different about this port.the graphics are the same as it was 3 years ago on the defunct sega dreamcast.
what's worse..no online option and you can't play your own souindtracks to replace the horrible jazz ecentric BGM during the battle stages. the music was MUCH MUCH better on capcom's previous efforts I.E. MARVEL SUPER HEROES, MARVEL VS CAPCOM OR EVEM XMEN VS STREET FIGHTER (heh, no wonder why i still have my SEGA SATURN as well as my DC)
but if the XBOX is your only system then your'e left with only one option buy it, otherwise avoid..btw where's the gamecube version...oh you mean there isn't one for the lamecube??...oops! one reason to hold on to your dreamcast!!!!"
1.0	I think after buying this, my wallet is Forsaken... I am Mistaken that this game is what I bought, it came in a box called Forsaken, I played this game about 3 times before giving it up cause I couldn't control the characters or understand the plot line.  I know that I have skills... but this game made me look stupid.  Cut your losses and buy something else like Quake II... now that rocks. What Is This?
1.0	Bricked on install. Was the older version of the Sensei (noticed by markings and stickers on bottom) One Star
1.0	I had it two months and it stopped working. For no reason, out of the blue, just no longer worked. Crap
1.0	My daughter (6) played this game once for about 10 minutes and has not played since. She says it is too boring. Daughter Hate it
1.0	I just expected so much more. This game falls super flat. It's very unbalanced and is riddled with stupid microtransactions. It's a 100% pass unless it's $10. HUGE Let Down! Very unbalanced. WAY too many microtransactions.
1.0	Waste of money. Oddly setup.
1.0	Junk.  I cannot get Windows 10 to cooperate with this mouse at all.  The firmware for teh mouse tends to crash and/or Win 10 periodically pretends the mouse does not exist.  After three weeks of trying everything I gave up. I started using a $12 mouse again because ist was 1000x more reliable. Junk. I cannot get Windows 10 to cooperate with ...
1.0	"I rarely write reviews for a product, but because I had extremely high hopes for this title, and the fact that they hyped a lot of promising features, I feel I have to join the many of agitated fans and express my total disgust with this game. This game is so unfinished, buggy, full of glitches... you name it. I am a casual gamer who broadcasts certain games on Twitch (look me up on there - Rockwood610 - yes; cheap plug). And after many of my Twitch viewers who would join me while I would play this game had more complaints about this title while egging me on to voice my opinions, I decided to leave a review in hopes that more people didn't get robbed of their money. Paying anymore then $30.00 for this game is a major ripoff.

I will try and been unbiased and give the credit where it is do, but believe me, there is not much credit to give. The few things that EA Sports did right are fantastic, but that list is microscopic in size compared to everything they did wrong. I am taking the time to write this review based strictly on principal. I am hoping that people decide NOT to buy this title on next gen platforms and really send a message to EA that this is completely unexceptionable.

First off, I wanna say that I have been a happy supporter of the NHL franchise from EA Sports since 2007. I have owned every game since then, and have enjoyed the series tremendously.  When i bought my PS4 in November of 2013, I was bummed out that there would not be a hockey title until September of 2014. So I was keeping a close eye on the development of NHL 15 through out the year.

This game show tremendous promise with the new presentation and game play upgrades that they where making. New NBC broadcasting presentation, new physics system for all skaters on the ice, new physics system for the puck,  fantastic live crowds in the arenas with over 9,000 character models in those crowds... lots of fantastic upgrades. All the things that EA where hyping about this game got me super excited. Even the demo showed lots of promise!

However, when early access to Xbox One people hit, the list of game play modes and features that where taken out of the game began to grow. EA left fans with the impression only 3 or 4 major modes would be missing, but as you can see, the list at the bottom of this review shows other wise. They even removed the basic offline Season mode that has been a staple in sports games since the regular Nintendo in the 1980's and 90's for crying out loud! But before I get to that list, I want to share my personal gripes and issues with this game.

First of all, I got a PS4 system crash with this game 5 times in 3 days. Error code CE-34878-0 would occur at random times during game play. I would be in the middle of a game, and it would just crash to the PS4 menu showing this error. It is the ONLY PS4 title that I have played that has done it on several occasions in such a short span. The demo did it several times as well.

Second, in the Be A GM Mode, there was no way to lock your position. Meaning you could not take control of a single position in a game, but you had to switch players to whoever was closest to the puck on the ice. This was annoying, because a couple friends and I practiced on the demo where one of us would played center, the other left wing defense, and the other right wing offense. We couldn't do that now, because locking your guy in Be A GM mode was no longer an option. Also in Be A GM mode, and this is a small gripe that isn't a huge deal, but shows EA rushed the hell out of this, but there where grammar and spelling mistakes in the menus when you would receive a scouting report!

The A.I. in this game is terrible. Leaving the game difficulty in the standard ""Pro"" setting without touching the sliders for the AI adjustments proved to be disastrous. I would win one game 7 to 0 and then get crushed the next by a lower rated team 9 to 2. Completely unrealistic. When bumping the difficulty to ""All Star"", the CPU turns into the incredible hulk  and I would get scored on 6 times in 2 shifts. There are heavy goal glitches where friends I know who have the game are winning 20 to 2 by the end of a 5 minuet 2nd period.

When playing Be A Pro mode, the announcers during commentary would constantly say my players name wrong. I chose 'Johnson' as my player's announcer name, and they would constantly call me ""Jones"" through out the game. Also in this mode, you can not simulate between your shifts when your off the ice or in the penalty box. And if you get ejected from the game due to an illegal hit (which it calls constantly for no reason), you either have to sit in the penalty box the entire game and watch the CPU play until then end of the game, or quit the game and start it over.

The presentation and the game play overall is very solid. The NBC Sports presentation is awesome to see with Dok Emerick on the mic. The crowds look great, the player models are top notch, but looks are not everything. Game play is solid, but is so buggy and glitch filled, leaving it feeling unfinished and incomplete.

Being super frustrated with the modes I played and the constant crashes, I put this pile of garbage up for sale. Below is the extreme long list of missing features, followed by the extremely short list of planned updates/patches for it. Does anyone else find it ironic that one of the modes EA left in the game is HUT (Hockey Ultimate)? Can you guess why? Because I know a few people personally who will spend several hundred dollars... REAL MONEY for card packs. In other words, cash cow EA made sure THAT mode stayed in....

The CPU will also propose trades to each other and the user throughout the draft.

In closing, I would like to say that I have supported the EA NHL franchise for years. But they clearly dumped to much time into pretty graphics and minor game play upgrades. This game was in development for 2 - yes TWO years, and you literally get 3 to 4 more game play modes then the demo offered. This was clearly put on the shelves in stores to do nothing but serve as a quick cash in. I hope the sales tank so bad that it cripples them for a while financially. There is no excuse for this other then the fact that they pushed it out to release to fill their bank book up. As you can see, not only did they take so much OUT of the game, but what they are planning to put into it makes no major improvements, it just makes attempts to fix or add to the game what you should already have access to as it is. This is the issue with gaming today - developers can release a half a$$ed effort and send out updates to the buyers to trey and fix issues with the game - half the time only doing it AFTER they see a decrease in sales. They don't care about anything but making money. And it's sad.

Please do NOT support this title. Make them suffer where it hurts - their wallets. Because that is obviously all they care about if they had any confidence in putting this game out there for sale. Major disappointment...."
1.0	Unacceptable. No return policy either. The game did not work, the battery was defective and this seller should reconsider their advertising before shelfing products being sold. View the images attached and you will see what kind of unacceptable service this seller provides. Unacceptable by all means.
1.0	I would have loved to have at least tried the trial version but it will not work in my system (Win7/64).  Amazon, it looks like I'm not alone, please fix this or remove it from your website.  It's a frustrating waste of almost an hour download only to find it's got a corrupted file and will not even install. Will not load
1.0	yeah they are cheap and the sound went out 2 days later not buy unless u get lucky One Star
1.0	item was not the one pictured,in the ad, couldn't get a refund, from the company,, wouldnt reccomend doing buisness with this company.. bad mistake
1.0	This is a horrible controller the top left joy stick in broken and i have been very gentle with it. since the actual nintendo brand cost too much i am just going to get the 2 pack to save money. so disappointed with it. Good for a month
1.0	dum things to do make face but doesn't everybody dies One Star
1.0	"kind of sad when the developers lied and said they ""remastered"" the game but people can still weapon slide and crab walk. If you really want this game, I'd wait till the devs actually do something and patch this game before buying it. Oh and it gets better, there is still a host connection. Ten years later guys, come on Same glitches as 2005"
1.0	I was quite excited about Operation Flashpoint after playing the demo.  It seemed the most realistic portrayl of warfare yet on the PC HOWEVER, after a failed installation I went to various websites attempting to find a soloution.  I read through 30 pages of people expressing problems with the patches, installation, textures and various other features of the game.  I am sure that for those of you who can install it, it will be nice however, check out the...to see what the people who have problems are saying.  I would not recommend a purchase of this game until you can be certain the bugs are fixed. Way too Buggy
1.0	"I played the demo for Dragon Age 2, and was genuinely excited for the installment. The first game was a bit restrictive, as far as options on where to go and what to do, but that's to be expected in certain RPGs.

DA2 took these restrictions to the extreme. Other than a few exceptions, you're restricted to one city, and the game plays over the span of a few years. This screams ""shortcut"". They didn't want to build new areas, so they used the same one with different appearances.

The gameplay is passable, nothing to write home about, but a fun experience. I finished this game as quickly as I could, just to get it overwith. Yes, it's that bad.

I'll be cautiously optimistic for DA3, but EA's involvement in these titles have been nothing but a setback. It's hard to support EA after what they've done to this title. Dragon Age 1 is the superior product"
1.0	"Same music, same battle engine, same lame charactor dialogue as Gandia II.
Even so it would have been a fun game if I could of skiped the crapy dialogue that was made for 5 year olds.
Would have been an excellent game if they would have hired some writers and voice tallent. But what they ended up with was a few hours of actualy fun game play mixed in with hour upon endless hour of crapy dialogue a five year old would find boring.
Pros: Great graphics
  Great gameplay (when there was any)
cons: unending crapy dialogue (made this game a no purchase for me) I played this before when is was called ""Grandia II"""
1.0	I ordered this again.  Because my special edition did not work so I figured that the tiny, barely noticeable scratch was the culprit. I even carefully cleaned the playstation.  But the 10-2 version STILL did not work, which was the whole reason I bought it!! I wanted that new explorable dungeon!!!  Thank god it is being released to PC soon!  I hope that the ps4 does not have the same hardware issues of the ps3.  I am saving up to buy it. WHY????!!!
1.0	Excellent.  What I was expecting. The right item
1.0	After Bioware's showings on Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age 2, it was quite clear that the EA board room was going to have more control over their games than their development team. Thus you end up with a rushed product. I'm sure the Mass Effect team did their best to reconcile what they felt needed to be done with the demands set upon them. It is not their efforts I critique, but their inability to fight for their own work. You can have a worthy conclusion to the saga or a two year development period, not both. So they saved some money on a short development and they loose a third of their fan base. I urge everyone not to buy this or at the very least wait until it's a value title. I will be selling my copy in order to take another $60 from Bioware/EA. I will not buy any DLC from them ever again and I will never purchase another game from them. What they don't understand is how quickly fans can walk away from them. I urge to do just that. I hope releasing another half baked game was worth it. Not Surprised, Yet Very Let Down!
1.0	"This game seemed interesting to me at first. I have never been a big donkey kong fan, but i do like adventure games. The overhead world looks nice, and the graphics are pretty decent, But what good is a game that starts off way too difficult on the first level? The time trial is way too difficult, but like most games the requirement for getting the gold medal for a time trial or other challenge is not too demanding. Another complaint i have is the controls. The wii remote is good for alot of things, but not for this game. To execute this  DK rolling move, you shake the remote. Now why do we not have the option to use a gamecube controller like we did in mario kart wii and SSBB, it is not like the wii was incapable of using the gamecube controller port for wii games.  That DK roll comes in handy with the time trials, but it is almost impossible to get the gold medal in the 1st level because it is a distraction to have to shake the remote while using the D-pad to move and a button to jump. An ideal way to play was to have the option to use a gamecube controller and have the DK roll assigned to the X button, but for some reason you cant use a gamecube controller. I know this is the wii and people want to utilize the wii's motion controls, but in this situation, it would have been best to use a gamecube controller. Games like mario party 8 and zelda twilight princess actually fully utilize the wiimote's motion controls.

In conclusion, this game does have nice graphics and presentation, but what kills it is the punishing difficulty and bad controls. Way too difficult in the beginning of the game, bad controls."
1.0	Sucks. The game was cracked when I got it. One Star
1.0	My expectations were met for my order with It's Your Turn and a pleasant buying experience.  Reason I bougth this is I need it a new guitar since my original Kramer die the game I gave away. The worse game from Guitar Hero
1.0	A FPS with goofy quick dodge commands needed to complete the game. VERY linier game play & again with these parts in the game that require a quick dodge, climb...whatever that MUST be completed to play the game. STUPID!  The game sells itself as scary, creepy FPS but the reality is that it is about as intense as Super Mario Bros. It was a waste of cold cash for me. Super Mario Bros is better than this
1.0	"My son and I have been playing Might and Magic since the second version.  We have loved each one, not that they were all perfect but it was enjoyable to play each other over the network or alone.  Well, we had high hopes for this version.  But after purchasing 2 copies (1 for me and 1 for my son) I angry there is no way to get my money back.

On the positive side:
The graphics are good.
Selecting the spells you want to learn instead of random is great.

On the Negitive:
You have to have internet connection to the Conflux server.
Saved campaign games are on the Conflux server not local.

Bottom line is that when (not if) the Conflux server goes down you are out of luck.  No multiple player games, can't continue your campagin games.  And guess what, the Conflux server does go down.  Check out their facebook page for the number of users having issues with the server down.  I wish I could return my 2 copies for my money back. Consumers need a way to get refunds on software!!!"
1.0	did not work !! One Star
1.0	Not even two weeks and the right thumb stick is broken. One Star
1.0	"I am not going to waste a lot of words on this review but to say that i agree with what everyone else has said about this game.

The controls were poorly placed and implemented, the AI is really bad, mapping even moreso  and the way the game saves to the point that you have to go back and pick up items really made this a frustrating title.

This was one of the worst XBox 360 titles I have played in a very long time.

Don't waste your money on this. Poor Controls and sloppy stealth elements killed this game"
1.0	I bought these headsets assuming I would be getting the  latest version 1.5 based on the product description. I received the older version and I am sending these back. I will wait to buy this headsets until I can walk into Best Buy or Gamestop and get the latest version. Amazon needs to change the pictures to show you will be receiving the old model. Buyer Beware. Wrong product description
1.0	"I bought two pads, and one of them were defective right off the bat. The defective one doesn't register the right step sometimes, and will press randomly other times. Same story with the up step. However, the other pad that isn't defective works very well, where I'll see it press the down step, but very rarely.

Edit 1/17/18: So after about 2 weeks the one mat that was mostly working has no started to miss steps and isn't responding as well. Sad that buying two mats led to only one that sort of works. Stay away from this product.

1/30/18: Both mats have, as of now, stopped functioning and are more useful as a paper weight. Stay away from this product like the plague unless you want to be frustrated to no end and out $70. Out of 2 mats, one works sometimes."
1.0	I would not give this product any stars,even though they make you. It wouldn't work. A message keeps coming up saying insert disk #1. I only received 1 disk. The package was stuffed with balled-up notebook paper, the one disk, and the code nothing else. I was very disappointed and so were my kids. The Sims 2 H&M Fashion Stuff
1.0	Terrible game poor hit detection silly story One Star
1.0	"the game sucks and its not realistic. this game would be fun if it had blood and if mario died instead of being defeated then it would be more realistic and fun, but i cant blame the people from the 1980s thinking blood was too violent. thats bull and this game sucks.

By the way, PROBLEM /v/? BLOOD!!!!!!!"
1.0	499.99 for a console nintendo sold new for only 90.00 I don't think inflation went up 300.00 on top of that this console caused nausea vomiting because of its red led display are you kidding me
1.0	I just got this mouse at least 30 minutes ago. Looks decent, solid, but the LED is broken. It won't light-up. Tryed it on 3 computers.. with drivers installed as well on all of them. I will be calling amazon tomorrow. I am planning to be exchanging it for a new one. Looks like it can be a 3 or 4 star product, clearly some QC issues. I've never had a dead gaming mouse in my life, really disappointing. Dead on arrival: Mouse LED broken
1.0	"I embarked on the myriad journeys of the epic FINAL FANTASY XIV, and lost 11 months of my life.

Currently suing Square-Enix for a time machine that will allow me to reclaim 11 months of my life. Time Sink"
1.0	why would anyone pay $1,000 for a 8GB white Wii U when you can get a new 32GB model with 3 games from Best Buy for $299.99 Ripoff SCAM Do not buy this
1.0	ubisoft removed god rays from PS4 because of XB1 parity clause.  that in my book is 0 star.  too bad, i can only put 1 star.  i will put 0 star, if i can. ubisoft removed god rays from PS4 because of XB1 parity clause.  that in my book is 1 star
1.0	I am glad that I am not the only one who is disappointed in this sequel.  I really enjoyed Still Life and looked forward to this release.  What a disappointment! The inventory storage closet was so annoying and found the puzzles to be ridiculous for the most part.  It became so bad for me that I went to the walkthrough and pretty much followed it just to finish the game.  Microids has had such great games in the past - Syberia I and II so I was pretty much a fan.  I don't know what happened.  Big mistake on my part was not reading the reviews before I purchased SL2.  I won't make that mistake again. Still Life 2 dud
1.0	"Terminator....how do I describe this game? Well, let's say it's just a piece of trash.

The gameplay isn't ALL bad. I mean, you do get to have a gun, and you DO get to shoot in selectable directions (Except up or down). However, it's a platformer with the worst jumping control in an NES game. There are even some small tiles that you NEED to jump on to move on, but there's a big chance you can fall THROUGH them. Heck, you can even jump through other platforms, too. So you'll have a really hard time ever beating the first level. If you do manage to get past the first level, you'll be likely to give up.

The sounds are dull. The music is a garbled 8-Bit mess. The sound effects are okay, I guess. But it's cruel having to listen to 2 beats over and over again. At least, in the first level, that was what it was like.

The graphics are decent, but they could have improved the backgrounds to make them look more Terminator-y.

Overall, the gameplay made this game blow up to smithereens. Stay away from it. Pure idiotic"
1.0	"I'm wondering what happened to that awesome WIP/Demo of ACM from 2011 E3 ?

youtube.com/watch?v=pyebULYg_vc&feature=youtu.be

Here same video from E3 compared with retail PC footage (Console versions look even worse than retail PC with framerate issues, full screen tearing and muddy low quality textures)

youtu.be/3z2qVebxlUo

I guess E3 presentation only existed especially prepared for that event because its not the same code Gearbox shipped on February 12th, not even close to it ! If you wanna understand at least fraction what was going on in those 6 years of development you need to read this post by one of Gearbox employes

reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/18ewf4/a_lot_of_you_are_rightfully_upset_at_the_final/

Basically what happened is complete NOTHING ! Whatever was done, not finished, not ready, not polished at the end Gearbox just ""glued"" together and probably even without passing any kinda QA just shoved it to the public and fans of the franchise... Shame on you Gearbox !

I am extremely disappointed triple A dev. studio practicing such a shoddy business model lying to its own fans/supporters with gameplay presentations and trailers that apparently never existed or never were intended to be a close to final code, because what I saw +year ago looked a lot better then what was served on a plate. $60 slap to the face !!!

If you support this title with full retail price and those stupid season passes I really feel sorry for you, basically you're sending message across the gaming industry saying it is ok to continue doing what they are doing and in case of Gearbox this is strike no. 2 because same thing happened to Duke Nukem Forever two years ago.

No matter if you are or not hardcore Aliens fan save yourself some money because two months from now this title will be most likely in bargain bin for $19.99 GAME OVER, MAN ! GAME OVER !"
1.0	"After using these for some months (I bought these on March) I decided to update my review since my position has changed a lot from then. After a month of use, these were already feeling loose and shifting around on the sticks, especially the left stick. After 3 months and a half or so the rubber at the base (beside the hole that secures onto the stick) of the cover on my left stick was already cracking. The cracks kept getting worse until a week ago when the cover finally failed. I decided to move on and use Xbox One sticks on my DS4.

[Original Review]
I bought this for my Dual Shock 4 as it has the premature stick peeling syndrome. These may look a little bit cheap but they fit good and securely on the sticks. One thing I was disappointed with is that for those with sweaty hands these covers still loose some grip after some hours of use. Still, the grip is better than the factory rubber on the DS4. If you want to buy because you have sweaty hands and want better grip, you may want to look at other alternatives, but if you want protection for your sticks these get the job done very well. [UPDATED 8/16/14] Not good to protect your DS4 sticks."
1.0	terrible, please no one waist your time with thinking too buy this game, yes the stories are somewhat funny, but damn it just go so boring and stupid so fast terrible, please no one waist your time with thinking ...
1.0	This game is absolutely amazing so why just 1 star?? Well the reason why is because my internet connection has been s***ty for months and I don't know why so as a result I can't play this game. Because you need to have a good internet connection to play this game. It's really frustrating I can't play this game, and when I said good internet I mean a good one. I see players getting kicked off the game all the time because of the internet, and that was the few times I could play. This game would be good if it had an offline mode. It's baffling how Nintendo does not include that. I mean come on it's an utterly stupid thing too do. Like really insanely stupid. I'm not usually one to say things like that in a review but it's just really stupid and lazy. Were paying $60 for this game. You can get really good games with bots in a free game on a freaking phone. This game honestly shouldn't cot anymore then $5. Thats just ridiculous. Fantastic game but this fact just destroys it completely for some people
1.0	"I'm writing this review as honestly and impartial as I can, from the prospective of someone that has played the civilization franchise for over 13 years.

Plain and simple, they dumbed down and washed out the game to make it more attractive and simple for a broader market. If you are a civilization fan, or enjoyed Civilization 4 for its strategy difficulty, its complexity and micro-management as well as the decission making problems and interaction with the AI, then save your money and don't buy this game, because all that is practically gone.

The game has been so streamlined and simplified that is border line irritating for someone that has played civilzation for the past decade. The cool changes regarding combat system, resource limitations, hexagonal grid, (which are great don't get me wrong) simple go out of the window when you are faced with a game that honestly seems to be geared to children and very casual gamers that don't like to think too much and see more action.

Added to that, is the poor (and by poor I really mean HORRIBLE) shape they shipped the game. I've had BETAs of games that were in a better shape than this. The amount of glitches, bugs, crashes and general game issues in Civilization 5 are just borderline un-acceptable. And to get the cherry on the cake, they force you to install and launch the game using STEAM, which is an online based service. So, doesn't mather if you bought your nice little CDs, you still have to go through Steam to install it, and use it. Now, Steam by itself is another company that has a reputation for very low quality services, and in this case they haven't improved anything. I suggest you go through the forums of Steam or 2k games and see the quantity of people that are days without been able to install or play normally their game just because of issues with Steam, in top of that you get the issues of the game itself which are below BETA quality.

The cool looking graphics, leaders in 3D talking their languages, and the incredible simplification (I won't go into detail because it's a lot) of the game simply screams ""geared for children, consoles and toysRus shelves"". Our beloved Civilzation strategy game is gone, completely.

So again, if you are new to the series and like a simplified strategy game to start, this is good for you. If you are an old civilization fan, or someone who enjoys strategy games for its complexity and micro-management then save yourself irritation and boredom and go out to have a nice dinner with those $[...] bucks. Firaxis has potentially killed his 18 year old franchise with this. If you are a former Civilization fan, save your money."

1.0	"I played this game hoping to see cool cut sequences and I did see cut sequences, but nothing cool. I felt bad that I had paid $ to view an ad for Matrix 3. I felt that the gameplay was not only weak but also boring. It was exceptionally easy.
The only good thing about the game was that the CGI in the game matched the terrible CGI in the movie, so I felt like I was actually playing the movie.
If you have to play this game to see what was not in the movie. Don't waste your time or money if you're interested in gameplay. terrible gameplay, weak storyline"
1.0	"Buyer beware - the product description does not describe some important
aspects of the game:

This game secretly installs copy-protection software called SecuROM which can cause many problems for your computer, some of which are:

1. When installing the game the user is not informed that SecuROM is being installed.

2. SecuROM denies administrators full access to their PC, and blocks the
administrator from editing certain parts of the registry.

3. SecuROM can interfere with the operation of hardware, specifically disc drives.

4. SecuROM can interfere with the proper operation of software.

5. When the game is uninstalled SecuROM is not uninstalled - it remains
permanently on your computer.

6. The manner in which SecuROM runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware, and many people do indeed consider SecuROM to be malware. This game secretly installs malware"

1.0	"This was a 5/5 game. I've played it through on the 360 and it was great. But on the Xbox One, I'm stuck with a game ending bug. I cannot play through again since the bug could easily occur again so there's no point...

I backed out of the game when it was idle and it has corrupted a save. When the game loads, I hear a campfire but the screen is black and I cannot move or hit any buttons. Restoring from cloud does nothing. Square Enix forums, Xbox forums all seem to know about the bug...When it's fixed, I'll update again...

Update: I contacted the Square Enix tech support folks and they are supposedly taking gamertags of those affected. It took a couple of complaint emails -- their first responses are idiotic (please adjust the sound in the sound settings - how the hell would I do that if I can't even press any button whatsover - and who actually believes adjusting the sound would unfreeze a game - absolutely moronic response).

There are a few current crazy theories on how to fix this error. 1 way involves using 2 xbox's (you recover the gamesave to the new xbox (not sure if the 2nd one should or shouldn't be patched). another involves trying to pull down your save via cloud but disrupting it so it doesn't work, then creating a new game, playing to one of the cutscenes, then going back to the old save. I've tried something like this and it didn't seem to do anything...I'm going to try again with a more involved process...

1.0	All I have to say is if anybody pays the same price for this Razer controller as they would for the Xbox One Elite you have to be insane... Razer products if you get two years out of them you are lucky.  Microsoft makes good stuff but they are overpriced... If you are just looking for PC gaming ... Go with a Steam Controller best controller I have used yet and made in the USA so its actually built good. If you pay $150 for any Razer product you deserve what you get... An expensive lump.

1.0	"I can't believe in this day in age, loading times can still take THIS LONG!! The worst thing about this game, and quite frankly, the dominating characteristic, are the loading times. If you mess up and want to restart the race, you must wait 24 seconds. Yes, I timed it. On some of the more challenging tracks, this can add up to a lot of frustrating time. Enough so that you will forget about the beautiful graphics cool layout and strikingly good sound effects. You end up just getting tired of waiting and want to move on.

Once it has loaded, it makes you feel like you have ADD (no offense) by cutting the image so rapidly between shots of the car and shots of randomly sequenced numbers. You can't skip through it either. Then if you ""reset"" you have to wait till the symbol blinks at you again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, before you're back on track. But if by chance you, lets say, drive off a cliff, it will reset you till right before that curve. But if you're driving one of the muscle cars that have no handling whatsoever, and you're speeding above 100mph, it'll keep resetting you until you miraculously stay on track - however, by then you're so far behind you have to start the whole race over again... and wait another 24 seconds.

Seriously EA, are you even testing these games for quality or just rushing a new version out the door every year? The the last NFS sucked too. What happened?"
1.0	There is a very common defect in this line of products. The second this controller gets connected to your Wii or Gamecube, it inhales all the electricity from it, and forces your system/console to shut down. You can try any 1 of the 4 ports, and you'll receive the same outcome. Never trusting this line of products again. Turns off your system for you!

I have four controllers, and four motion plus add-ons, and three nunchuks.  (Obviously this limits us to three people for games that require the Nunchuk, which is fine.)  The problem is that only one of my Nunchuks works with the Motion Plus.  The other two work okay without the Motion Plus, and the Motion Pluses all work okay without the Nunchuks.  Combine them though, and only one works.  No good at all for three kids.  I've tried moving around the Motion Plus and Nunchuks, and it's very consistent. Buggy?"

1.0	I loved the first Shellshock Nam game, it was so much fun.  This game is just lousy.  It has some moments that they tried to make interesting, but the actual gameplay is just so sluggish and dull.  It not anything like the original Shellshock game.  You're better off just skipping this one entirely. Hated it
1.0	At the moment this game is pretty much unplayable for most people. Activison and Treyarch must have known that the PC version had major issues but released it anyways. This is another example of a console game ported that wasn't optimized for the PC.  Now, we have to wait for patches to come out while the consoles gamers can play without any problems on day one. This tells us how much Activision and Treyarch gives a crap about the PC community now. I am not going to buy another COD until they start supporting the PC community again. Waste of Money and time
1.0	This game is huge step back for the franchise - the futuristic nonsense is just... Terrible. Not only is the gameplay bad, the colors in this game are just dull and and lifeless. And don't even get me started on the zombies.. BO2 set a pretty high standard, and it just doesn't compare. Bad.
1.0	"Don't believe the hype.  Look at all the reviews on this site that just blush about this game.  They all seem a bit too well written, i.e. how amazon is known for selling reviews and promoting such great reviews for products with a lot of marketing behind them.

  Back to the actual game.  My first complaint.  There is just too much going on, the game's environment is way too busy.  Most games of this nature would introduce complicated aspects to a game a piece at a time.  This game unloads more than a handful of new aspect:, game play, plot structure, up mods (of which there are plasmoids and other such features, of which's ammo aren't named the same but are ADAM and EVE) game mapping all in a matter of a minimum of two hours of game play.  The map is just utterly confusing, even with the arrow that points you in the right directon (which it does only at cerain aspects of the game).  To help on this confusion they have a number of ""diaries"" made to unlock glimpses of the plot to you.  Playing for about a half hour two hours in I ran across at least five.  It becomes so over whelming to have to listen to these diaries to keep up to date on what you're supposed to look out for that they should have found a better way to incorporate them into the game (i.e. You have to find them, recognize them asgainst the several options you have to search for - ammo, money, plasmoids, upgrades, health, etc etc - that to see ""oh it's another diary on the microscopic font on the screen"" and then hold down A and listen to it while doing everything else.)

  Additionally, the setting is so dark - which as a mood setter is good, but for game play is horrible.  Someone would appear behind you shooting a tommy gun and it would take more than a few seconds of gaping around before they're actually found.  At which point you've lost a good amount of health.  Then there's the vita tanks.  The points where if you die you're automatically respawned with just about every weapon/item you had before.  And if you were fighting an someone, then the damage you had inflicted is still present.  Ever heard of that in a game before?  Neither had I, and it's there because if it wasn't you toss the game in your closet and forget it.

  Did you play Condemned:  Criminal Origins?  Did you like it?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  In that case avoid this game, because the fighting style is basically the same.  Nameless lackee jumps out from wall swinging wildly in that same clunky manner, running in the same style.  And you're melee attack is exactly the same.  They may have well as called this game.  Condemned:  Aquatic Surrender.  Thank God, I rented it. Don't Believe the Hype"
1.0	I read a review stating that if you picked case #21, you would win the $1,000,000.  I was skeptacle so I went to a local used video game store.  They had a used copy so i asked if I could use it, they allowed me to.  The other review was right!!  I picked #21 and I picked the magic case.  The game is very predictable and is also very slow moving.  There is no fun in this game at all.  The graphics are not the best but they are not bad.  Other than that, the sound is good and basically the game play is the same as the show.  If you can live with predictability, get this game, if not, it's no deal!!! Game gets old fast

1.0	"You know when I played through mass effect 1 and 2 and gearing up for 3 I was thinking that this game trilogy could be one that would make record books and leave a mark in gaming history. I waited a little bit on Mass effect 3 when it came out for a price drop maybe and let all the bugs and problems to be ironed out. Well it didn't take long for me to hear the rumors of the bad ending and the complaints. I have heard the majority of people give their ""opinion"" on alot of games and I never agreed with them. So when I heard the ending was bad I took it to heart but thought that there couldn't be anything bad enough to ruin this saga........I was so wrong....

I won't ruin the ending, but let me just say that if you heard the ending was bad from a friend or someone and heard all the bad rumors, believe them 100%. All your hopes and dreams for the mass effect trilogy will go up in smoke in the last few minutes of the game. This damage to the ending and the expectations is so great, that you very well may not even sleep at night, lol. Mass effect 3 in my opinion cannot be reviewed without dragging 1 and 2 into the mix. Why? Because unlike some other games, the Mass effect trilogy is based on your choices and the choices that you make carry on. Its a long story that is somewhat molded by your choices. But Bioware didn't seem to take that into consideration near the end of Mass effect 3. I don't care about how great Mass effect 3's graphics are or the special effects. Or even the increased difficulty I longed for. This game ruined Mass Effect 1 and 2 then ultimately offed whatever was left in the franchise.

I am sorry there is no excuse for this Bioware, and I hope listen to your fans. You honestly have lost alot of respect from me and your ability to make a good rpg saga such as Mass effect. Making mass effect 4 while keeping Mass Effect 3's ending the way it is won't fly with me. You lost a customer, and I am not the kind of person who says stuf like that. I am not sure if you were on some bad medication when you wrote the ending or what, but since you refuse to listen to fans, you have now alienated yourself. I could care less about your new ideas for Mass Effect 4. You get a score on Amazon of 1, and wish I could give less. You promised a rpg of choices and instead you gave us something that wasn't even of this world. Or like I said, maybe some drugs were involved when making the ending. What happend to this great trilogy?"

1.0	"This is getting ridiculous.  I'm playing a single-player campaign, working to the next checkpoint and get a 5-minute warning I'm going to be kicked out of my game because Blizzard is updating their DRM server again.

So I get kicked, have to wait for them to get the server back up so I can log back in, and I lose ALL PROGRESS ON MY CURRENT MAP.  I'm back at the previous checkpoint.  This happens 2-3 times A DAY.

This is the worst launch I have ever taken part in, and I am including Anarchy Online and Half-Life 2 in that.  There is no excuse for the incompetence being displayed by Blizzard in regards to anticipating server needs which they had already tested MULTIPLE times during the beta and open stress tests.

So, 1 star for me.  I will not recommend this game to anyone.  A friend just asked if he should purchase it and I told him to buy Skyrim instead.

I suggest the same to any who bother reading this review. I never do this, but.."

The loading process is very slow and I have never seen a ""Do you want to continue were the game crashed"" message. Very frustrating

The ""new parts"" that you can use to upgrade your creature can get very monotonous, many parts have the same characteristics and only a very slightly difference en in appereance

Graphics quality seems to be 5 or 10 years old. Very frustrating after all the expectation

The game is son unreliable to play that is not even good to give to someone as a GIFT

Don't buy this terrible game. A unreliable game - crashes very often"
1.0	I was excited to get the game.  Ultimately though, it is really boring.  I found I had to force myself to trudge on, even though I didn't want to.  Eventually, I wasn't able to play anymore.  There just isn't enough there to keep me interested.  The story lines are not good.  After the first few I just started clicking through them to get to the fighting.  Even that though isn't great.  There isn't enough strategy needed to fight.  It is mostly just hack and slash.  You can easily make it to level 20 without ever needing to use a healing potion.  Overall, it is just boring. Boring
1.0	"I am a great fan of Corsair with about $1000 dollars worth of their product in this high end machine I am using to enter this review with a Logitech keyboard I had hoped to replace, not because of any defect, but for a step up in features.  After four hours on the K95, I have been completely disappointed.

In no particular order, the information on the website makes no mentioned that only one bank of macros can be stored in the keyboard, and that if you want to use all three you must have their software installed and running. I bought it to get more keys.

There is absolutely no provision for entering a block of text commands for example to enter into game engines. You must type each character into the keyboard, no copy-paste, and you cannot edit as you are entering. There is no provision to easily alter it once entered, and it cannot be extended easily. My macros are large, involving dozens of lines, and need to be changed frequently. The Corsair software can only be described as primitive and unfriendly. Such a design as theirs is best used with macros that involve only a few keystrokes, so editing is not required as retyping would be much faster. They really need to take a hard look at the Logitech high-end keyboards.

The tiered keyboard is lovely, but the change in height between the tiers is excessive, requiring a substantial finger lift in order to get to a tier further back. The side walls of the keys have no taper, and the radius on the top edge chamfer is so slight as to form a sharp edge. I have 60 year of touch typing under my belt, and this is among the worst keyboard for that purpose I have encountered.

In moving from the letter f to the letter t, I don't lift my finger. I relax downward pressure and push my finger forward. As it encounters the t key cap, it rides up the sloped side and settles into the depressed surface where I apply downward pressure. In the case of the K95, the abrupt wall and high keytop simply blocks my forward movement. Thus I must use a more complex motion that is awkward, slower, and more tiring. I must lift my finger to the proper height, plus a bit, and place it over the keytop, and as I begin downward pressure, I encounter the keytop, and hope I have been accurate in positioning or I will get two keys. An hours typing had me completely convinced they have much to learn about keyboards.

The wrist rest is too shallow and too low to be of any use at all. This board is best used with two finger typists or those who hover over the board with their hands and pound down on the keys -- a sort of equivalent to the claw grip of a mouse. For those who rest their fingers on home row or WASD, and the heel of their hand on the wrist rest, it is a tough board to type with.

I love the build quality, and the solidness as well as the look of the board. But it is useless for my purposes. Perhaps I am unique in all the world, but considering that I might not be, I thought I would publish this report. I hope you have better luck than I did. It's on it's way back for credit.

I love how easy it is to deal with Amazon on such things. A great dissapointment"

1.0	"Not going to point out all the BS you have to endure in Diablo 3 which makes it completely not worth buying at this time (give it until late 2012 at least), others have already done this enough. I'm just going to point out my secondary reasons for disliking it: I am a story-oriented player (I loved Skyrim for instance) and D3 has little to no real plot. The single-player game is really just there to get you up to speed so you can PVP online vaguely similar to League of Legends. If you like that sort of game you will still not like D3 due to the bugs and connection issues, but when (presumably later in 2012) they get their house in order, the game should be enjoyable for you.

For me, D3 fails on all levels: not story-driven, and bugs and connection-issues are so frequent that it reduces the fun in single-player mode, leading to frustration. Wait until December 2012 to buy it."

But you can only go so far until you've reached your limit and it looks like COD has reached theirs.

1.0	"Any install limits are unacceptable for a game, and I am boycotting greedy EA's products for that reason. For my birthday someone gave me the money to preorder Spore months before I learned about the install limit, which is the only reason I own it.

The game is beautiful looking, has great sound, and does not crash my computer at all. In that it reminds me of SimCity Societies, which I admired for the same reasons. And like SimCity Societies, Spore doesn't have much actual gameplay. It's easy and fun to build things, for a while, but the game itself doesn't take any strategy or even much time.

As others have noted, you can change your creature at any point with no penalty - so much for evolution. All style, no substance for someone who wants a indepth game to PLAY.

If not for SecuROM, I would have considered this game a possible good base for future expansions that might have made it more interesting. I won't be putting another penny into purchasing new EA products while there are install limits. There is a limit to the inconvenience I'll accept in order to play a game, and EA has passed the limit by a very long distance. Install limits unacceptable, game disappointing"

1.0	"I actually bought this game even though it will be the last Infinity Ward game I support by purchasing. I've been a huge fan of said developer since Call of Duty 1, a PC exclusive, since day one. I've purchased every single Call of  Duty game developed by Infinity Ward over the years (including the expansion for CoD1 which wasn't developed by them). I never had a problem purchasing their products. Until now. This is the first time I've ever felt like a total tool and a moron for purchasing their ""PC game"".

The game IS phenomenal. The graphics are noticeably improved over Modern Warfare 1, despite using the same graphics engine.  The overhaul is there, but a lot of current gen games have better visuals.  Sound design is great as always. There's a lot of recycled sounds and some new ones. Multiplayer is more of the same which isn't a bad thing, and the new co-op mode, from what I've played so far, seems fun. That's where my positive review ends. So basically you get more of the same, with slightly upgraded graphics.

Here's where things turn bad.  For starters, Activision is charging $60 for this game, a move that completely goes against the grain of PC game pricing trends. Why? Because they can.  It's a business move, yes, but it's completely immoral and greedy. Corporate greed rears its ugly head.  Activision are the new EA.  You would think for $10 you would get, oh I don't know, a longer than average single player campaign right?  Well you don't.  If you thought Modern Warfare's campaign was short prepare to get slapped in the face with a campaign that can easily be completed in one session.  Bigger price, smaller experience.

But most people are probably buying it for multiplayer anyway, so let's discuss that. Basically it's all been said before. This is a console port, right down to being limited to 9v9.  Want to get your clan together for some 32 vs. 32?  Nope.  16 vs 16?  Nope.  Oh come on then....at least give me some 12 v 12.  Sorry Charlie.  You get 9v9, just like the console. And just like the console you can't sort servers and pick where you want to play, you can't tweak game parameters via a developer console (another PC industry standard that Infinity Ward think's it's too good to implement), and, OH, no dedicated server support.

Frankly, I'm surprised the PC port even allowed me to play with a mouse and keyboard....

It's painfully obvious that Infinity Ward prefer console development at this point (particularly the 360, which gets exclusive content before anybody else for the second game in row now), and it's even clearer that Activsion are greedy jerks.

It was a good run, Infinity Ward, but just like real life I won't associate with conceited, big-headed people. You won't get any more of my money.  MW2 gets one star for actually being a fun game, but insulting PC gamers by lying about features that never made it to the game (dedicated servers, more people per server than the console versions, etc), and the fact that your publisher is price gouging, keeps it from scoring higher.

** APPENDED MULTIPLAYER INFO **

Okay so I've put in a few hours of multiplayer over the last few days and my worst fears were confirmed consistently.  Horrible latency just ruins the experience.  The game measures latency by a 4 bar system, similar to a mobile phone's signal strength.  So rather than seeing what your latency is as measured by miliseconds, you will see 1-4 bars.  Usually 3. Very rarely in my time playing MP did I ever have 4 bars, unless I was hosting the game.  I kept a close eye on other player's latencys(using the TAB button) and probably 70% of the players had 3 bars as well, with usually just 1 or 2 people having 4 bars - one of which was the player hosting the game - and a couple unfortunate fools who were somehow getting by with 2 bars or less. The person who hosts a game enjoys a SIGNIFICANT advantage over even those with 3 bars. The killcam proves it. Time after time after time I would get killed and, through the eyes of my opponent thanks to killcam, notice that there was about a half second difference between what I saw and what actually happened. Then I'd hit the TAB button and sure enough, that guy has 4 bars and I only have 3. Ridiculous. I have a fast enough internet connection (2 MB up), and don't notice these latency disadvantages with other shooters, so I have to put the blame solely on IWNET.

It's really unfortunate and it's just the way it is which is sad as the multiplayer seems really fun and the levels are well thought out. The reality is if you want to play Multiplayer you're going to have to put up with a LOT of frustrating deaths, even if you get the drop on somebody, because he is enjoying a significant latency advantage.

The matchmaking is also broken.  It's supposed to match you based on latency (therefore location) and skill, so why was I constantly in matches with people with 1-2 bars of latency, versus lieutenants and generals when I was only a lowly specialist?

Bottom line is if you have either console and a PC, just get the console version because that's all you're getting on the PC. The PC version has no right disgracing the other games on your hard drive by pretending to be a PC game itself.  This game fails utterly. I would rate it half a star if I could. Fun game, but shame on Activision and Infinity Ward"
1.0	Thought it was a fair and good asking price.  I waited too late (2 months) to play it after purchase.  It doesn't play so it 's defective. Does not play
1.0	"I currently own two pairs of Sennheiser headphones and have always praised them for their quality of sound and comfort, but they don't know the first thing about designing a gaming headset. After the initial excitement of unboxing the U320, I quickly learned that they were terrible in almost every way imaginable, so my review is all about cons.

1. The ear cups are angled so far upward that there was a very noticeable gap between the tops of the ear cups and my head, and I do not have an abnormally thin head. Also, while the padding and fabric on the headband (and ear cups) is very nice, as I expected from Sennheiser, it is too straight to cup the top of my head at all, so the entire weight of the headset rests right at the center of my scalp. Not comfortable.

2. I plugged the U320 into my laptop to test them out on Skype first, and discovered that the ""Game"" volume actually controlled the chat, and the ""Chat"" volume did nothing. And after plugging the RCA audio cable into the inline controller on the headset, the person I was chatting with could no longer hear me, although I could still hear him. Which brings me to my third con:

3. (This will only be an issue for PS3 owners) 12' feet of cable is fantastic for me. I was glad to know that I could use this headset from anywhere in my livingroom, but boy was I wrong. Yes, the USB cable is long, but the included RCA cable - which runs from the inline controller to the TV/sound system - is only 6 ft. HOW did Sennheiser decide that this was a good idea? Yeah, I can easily plug the USB cable into my laptop or my PS3, but I can't plug the RCA cable into the TV. For those that are new to wired PS3 headsets, the RCA cable is how you get your game audio and the USB connection is for chat. I have used Turtle Beach's PX21's and P11's, and what I love most about those headsets is the ability to plug the USB cable into my laptop to chat over Skype while simultaneously receiving game audio via the RCA cables. With the Sennheiser U320, this is not a possibility for me unless I want to pull my chair forward 2-3 feet. I'm only about 8' away from the TV as it is, but even that is too far.

I can't comment on sound quality because there was no sense in testing that out after I realized that this headset is useless to me, but my friend did tell me that my chat mic. on my P11's sounded better than the one on the U320's.

This is such a disappointment to me. I am a big Sennheiser fan and was desperately seeking something comfortable to replace my P11's. After searching for a good headset for a while, I decided to check and see if Sennheiser makes a gaming headset. When I saw that they do and that they offer a 2-year warranty, I thought I'd be set for at least the next couple of years. Now I have to keep searching. Sorry Sennheiser"

And it is a very nice wheel , when it works

update - No Response from Logitech Customer Service.  Really , no response !  But Amazon is happy to replace this defective unit with a new one - free of charge -  Thank you Amazon.

 I received this monster yesterday and just started installing it this morning.  It is now 4pm  and it still does not work properly.  First note that I have confidence that some day soon it will be working but it is a disaster out of the box.  There is absolutely no instruction provided with this thing.  Yes there is a picture gram of the wiring but seriously - who really needs that ?  You will need to go to google  to find out that you need to down load Logitech gaming software plus up date the g920 firmware.after that you are totally on your own.  I have been trying to use it in 4 games - Euro Truck Sim2 , Farm Sim 17, Dirt Rally and Assetto Corsa.  Just to be sure it not a single game issue.  I can get the thing to steer and the gas and brake work but there is no force feed back at all.  I have searched the games forums and there are just no answers for this problem.  maybe the unit is defective. I have emailed customer support.  If it ever starts working I will up date this review.
Right now I'm really wishing I had bought the cheapest wheel 1 star because Installation is a nightmare  - No Customer Support from Logitech - sad ...;"
1.0	"And I am tempted to rate lower. This game is extremely frustrating. Given how popular it is and highly rated plus the anticipation for the new game I expected a lot more of this game. Yes it is a beautiful game and the idea is cool as well as the mechanics - though it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief since many of the moves cannot be done by any human being. Or at least a human on a planet with gravity. But what has forced me to lower my rating - this game is extremely frustrating. Unless you know exactly what to do you will keep dying until you figure it out or go online. I HATE going online to see how things are done but this game has forced me several times and I am in the middle of level 1. The way to go is seldom obvious or even partially visible. I have died dozens of times in different areas trying to figure out exactly what is the next. And even with the Runners vision and things marked with red it is NOT noticible. Really frustrating.

Updating my rating. Dropping it down to 1 star. I DO NOT see what others see in this game. After over an hour doing the same damn spot. Trying g to first figure out what the Hell I am supposed to be doing and then jumps that must be exact to places yout cannot see. And now this damn gate and such a limited time to get to it. I am inches away from smashing this damn pain in the ass game. You Will Died A LOT. So frustrating."
1.0	I recently purchased this game to add to my Jaguar game collection. I remembered playing it when I had a Jaguar years ago, and remembered it being dull. Its pretty much the worst racing game I have ever played, it can't even compete with SNES/Genesis 16 bit racing games. The car is impossible to control and the game feels like they rushed development to meet some deadline. Virtua Racing for the Sega Genesis is worlds ahead. The cheap price reflects the poor quality of this game. Skip it! ...Lame

1.0	"I bought these from Best Buy and wrote my review here just to see what is the buzz is about and really I'm not really a fan of these headsets turtle Beach pretty much makes their headsets partially the same one as the other but just change the design. They market their headsets like if all the people that's going to buy them are professionals and play in tournament but in reality people just buy them just to play games and they just put the price tag higher just because they're sponsored by big teams and call of duty. They claim that this headset is the best one to defeat the enemy and its all this BS. I've had a tons of turtle Beach headsets and all of them break in about 4 months and the leather that they use is not real leather so it's going to rip apart really quickly. It has come to the generation where companies just make their headsets look cool that's all they do with gaming headsets they don't make them to sound good they make them to look cool so people will buy them.  If I was you I'd steer of all turtle Beach headsets and I'll go somewhere else like Sennheiser or Astro. I recommend going to Sennheiser or Astro because if these break ""which they will"" customer support on turtle Beach is a pain in the butt to get hold of. You have to wait almost a week for agent to get to you and that's not to get you your RMA that's to ask you questions and troubleshoot then you have to wait another week for them to contact you back Where is Sennheiser or Astro theyll contact you in 24-48hrs.  Don't believe that  turtle beach when they say that they're the best in the audio business it's not true. They market these headsets for people that aren't aware of better headsets out there. give them about like three months and they'll come out with another headset saying that, THAT headset it's the best one, it's absurd.

1.0	"I use this on an iMac for Starcraft 2. This mouse is insanely sick and comes with a mac compatible software that lets you customize your DPI, colors, and response actions for all the buttons on the mouse. The scroll wheel alone has 3 different buttons (swipe left right or click) that you can bind to any keyboard key, or any other computer function, including launching an app. I believe there are a total  of 17 buttons that can be bound. You can also set macro functions I believe, and the software has a presets feature that you can change in your sidebar at any time. The coolest feature, I think is that the mouse can be calibrated to perform at optimal performance on any surface, Just calibrate it on a mouse pad or table surface, and you're good to go! You can also set the mouse refresh rate between three settings to to get a better response.....

After sticking with Razer for years, I can no longer recommend any of their software or hardware. I had hoped that they would eventually work through the necessary software that is riddled with bugs that you have to use to even use your mouse, but issues only seem to be getting worse. Whether it is having a randomly high DPI (like 10k) everytime I start my computer is infuriating enough on its own. But then to have to navigate to an iconm run the app as an administrator, and then try to locate it in the system tray and just pray that 1/10 times I'll be able to catch the new icon and click it to tell it to open the full application in time, is near impossible.  I owned 2 different Nagas, and the logo on both mouses have actually gone out, One of the DPI sensors on one of them goes completely wacky for 1-2 minutes a day sometimes more for no reason, and the ability to color code is extremely limited. and you're good to go"
1.0	Ugg.  I am having nothing but trouble with playing this game.  Most times I go to play, I cannot connect to the EA Server!  Once I do connect, I am constantly being dropped.  I cannot believe I purchased this game and trusted EA.  I knew that I would NOT be able to play this game on my laptop while traveling, but I figured that as long as I could play at home, I will be OK....  Nope.  EA has really botched this game!  I also find it VERY frustrating that my cities are very dependent on playing with other players.  You cannot really build a city that is self supporting.  So, you have to rely on there people and hope that they will not grief you while playing.  I really regret this purchase.  I will NEVER buy another game that requires online.

1.0	Feeling nostalgiac?  Heavenly Guardian may seem as if it may quench the need for some brainless, old school shooter action a la Pocky & Rocky if you want to get specific, but the game is so dated that it detracts from the gameplay.  Then again, the gameplay doesn't have much going for it in the first place, based on the fact that the game just isn't all that fun.  Heavenly Guardian's gameplay mechanics are basically broken to boot, and the co-op gameplay isn't much better.  Not to mention that if you manage to play Heavenly Guardian for any substancial amount of time, you'll find that the game as a whole is quite short.  All in all, Heavenly Guardian carries a budget price tag for a reason, and no matter how the game may look to you, you are much better off leaving the game on the shelf. Awful
1.0	"I've been playing WoW since beta phase 2, so well over 6 years. I have the panda collector original edition pet, and every collector pet since then. I have 5 level 80 characters of which one is a day from 85 and the others are all ranged dps so they will take about a week each to get to 85, since they all started in t10+ gear. So I have experienced every little bit of WoW short of the level 85 experience.

Whats wrong with Cataclysm ? Well, if you aren't a Goblin newbie, everything. The content is moderately interesting, but the quest engine is badly broken. Let me say from the outset that quite a few have completed all the quests in Vash, Deep, and Hyjal. But a huge number of players got halfway through the quest chain in both Vash and Deep and then could no longer find NPCs giving quests. The GMs say it is a known bug and is being worked on, but this means the only way to level pretty much is random dungeons. And these days, with so many in the same fix, the wait queue for a random dungeon team can run well over 10 minutes. For a healer!

And since questing has ALWAYS been the premier attraction of WoW expansions (only way you can experience the unveiling of the Lore) it is quite clear Blizzard really let us all down on this. Frankly, if you are just starting, just buy the base game, or even Wrath of the Liche King, which plays great up to level 80, and the quest chain works all the way to 80 and beyond. Until you are a Northrend master.

Don't buy this expansion, Blizzard doesn't deserve the money until they fix the game to deliver what was promised! What a disappointment"
1.0	"This game feels like a game made by someone else that Square Enix purchased and slapped the Final Fantasy name on it for a cash grab. I've played for several hours and I have no idea what the story even is, there's so little of it. Leveling up and creating ""mutated"" abilities is really confusing and seems mostly left to chance. Out of the gate the game is far too easy, there's very little chance of enemies actually inflicting damage to you and you one-shot everything. Acquiring or crafting new items for your character is also confusing. Your character does not level up themself at all. FYI, there is no ""exploring""; you cannot venture into the world to explore without having a quest. All quests are timed, and when the time runs out, you're teleported back to town. There's hardly time to explore anything in the time allotted as you get further into the game because quest goals are so far away. I feel like a mule, not an explorer. not a final fantasy game"

Also, lots of static noise. I didn't even bother with the mic because I couldn't stand the sound or feel of them long enough to get into a game.

Somehow my hair was stick in the slider to extend the size, because my hair got pulled when I tried to take them off.

1.0	"7/27/11 -- Have played about a third of it multiple times.  Even after you install it (Windows 7 system) and let it spend an hour and a half downloading all the fixes, the game is so buggy it's frustrating as heck to play.  DON'T apply the second CD/DVD thinking that will help -- I ended up in an area that I literally could not get out of.  I uninstalled and started all over *again* with just the NWN2 portion of the game.  Gameplay itself would be good, if it worked consistently.  The storyline is ok; I could do without the cut scenes.  You can cut some of them short by clicking the mouse, but you run into the risk of inadvertently hitting a choice on a multiple choice menu that you didn't realize was coming up.  Sometimes the characters won't follow the leader.  Sometimes the characters won't attack even when you tell them to.  I'm just finding it incredibly poorly implemented.  (There's one character I ""save"" only to find him again needing to be saved -- and he doesn't remember our earlier encounter.)  I have no idea what further issues are in store for me.  I really cannot recommend this purchase unless you're willing to fight the gameplay as well as the creatures in the game itself. Buggy as all get out"

People will argue that Steam isn't DRM but that's exactly what it is. I have the game on CD with the expansion. I can't install them though because steam doesn't work right. The game won't install while Steam is offline, so why do I have a disc? I don't know. When I go online, steam won't connect because either their servers are down or windows firewall blocks something (although I doubt that since I turned it off, but that's what steam says). People who pirated the game are playing it right now, probably reading this post and laughing because their copies just work and they didn't pay $50 for the first DVD and $50 for the expansion like I did. Of course the joke is on everyone because the game runs slow even on higher end systems. I have a friend running a PC with 32GB of RAM and two NVIDIA 680's in SLI with a 256GB SSD and even on that beast of a machine the game crawls to a screaching halt of performance after about 40 turns. The farm graphics disappear completely from the screen so knowing what is built on a tile requires you to hit F10 to see what's actually there or to hover the mouse over each tile until you find something that you haven't built on.

Summary: Good game made bad by Steam DRM and poor coding.

What I would like to see Firaxis explain: How much did firaxis pay for this to win game of the year and did the people who gave the award get to actually play a complete game all the way through on a huge map with multiple city states and civ's? If so, what was their trick to actually getting the game to work the way that it should? Horribly Disappointing game in this franchise riddled with DRM, DLC, and flawed graphics rendering"

I did play the first one and riptide on PS3 and had a great time at that.
I'm writing this review to take it down a peg and make my voice count.

Don't like that. Not one bit. PS users get shafted on this one..."
1.0	I've had an unsatisfactory experience with the PS3.  After only three months, I'm waiting for my third PS3 from Sony.  My first unit would freeze up when playing Blue-ray movies, and it crashed permanently when I played my first 1080p game, Ninja Gaiden Sigma.  Sent it back to Sony.  The first replacement unit from Sony would not boot up, so it also went back to Sony.  I have my fingers crossed for the next replacement when it arrives.  My Xbox 360 is doing just fine, and it has better graphics, IMO. Play Station 3 Review
1.0	The rubber on these grips are horrible and feel funny. It wasn't worth sending them back to get my money back. These felt horrible!
1.0	Zelda is the most over rated game series ever made. And Wind Waker is the worst Zelda game made. First of all i will just start talking about how bad the graphics are. What we are looking at here are 2D Pixel Shaded Graphics. I can possibly understand these graphics for a racing game, or possibly a fighting game. BUT NOT AN ADVENTURE GAME. Yes Ocarina of time was OK, but not good enough to save this series. Wind Waker completly destroyed it. Link looks and talks like a complete loser. But you may say graphics aren't everything. I can agree with that SOMETIMES, but when they are as horrific as these, i cant even play the game. Now the story and gameplay. Can u hit Z and press the A button multiple times? Well then you can beat Zelda Wind Waker. The game is meant for kids, no doubt about that. There is a talking Ship FFS. What is going on here nintendo?!?! I think you get my point on why windwaker sucks. The main things are that the graphics suck, and the game is easy, boring, and just plain stupid. This game sucks. just like lazy a$$ nintendo and their systm
1.0	Like everyone else here said, this game only features one save file that can never be erased.  So no one else, including yourself, will ever be able to start over.  Also, Mercenaries is a mode that is a free mini game after completing the newer RE games.  So even if the save file BS didn't exist, this still wouldn't be a worthwhile purchase. One save for a game that should be free.
1.0	"Well, here I am again, giving the one star middle finger to a game program I never got to run (the same as the Orange Box and F.E.A.R. 2)  All this through the mail in one week.

So here it is.

1.  No minimal system requirments listed.  This one isn't even listed on the box or the manual!
2.  You have to have the internet to run this program--that's not listed either.

I'm gonna install this on my new quad core....and I don't even know if it will run!

Update;  It crashes right after I click on play/run...maybe the graphics card I guess--but since I don't know which one is needed I guess I'll have to do a search.
bye. Warning!"
1.0	Another year another broken game. They fixed sum problems and created even more. If you do purchase this game i would highly recommend that you stay away from the online part of it as its nothing but frustrating, do to the constant errors that were created by the games developers .

You have to hide forever and hope to not be spoted. Not my style. It was a wasted effert on the develepers. Horable game"
1.0	"It is Wii-wheel compatible, and you steer with the wii mote turned sideways.
All the courses must be unlocked and I didn't see any alternate carts, each character has his or her own and that is it. You collect silver stars on the race course to use your character's ""Special Power"", which can be anything from freezing opponents or time warping and skipping ahead part of the map. Gold stars you collect on the maps will unlock extra characters.

Gameplay wise, it is difficult to steer. You can pass over item boxes like Mario Kart. There is a ""Arrow Boost"" type thing similar to Mario Kart's mushroom. But it is kind of useless and most of the time it would catapult me off a cliff or smash me into a wall. There is also an ""Arrow"" similar to green shells in Mario Kart and they pretty mush work the same.

It's basically a Mario Kart clone, as you might expect. However, not nearly as good. What you might expect"

1.0	"I own every C&C game since, well, since C&C was Dune. I've been waiting for this title since it was announced. But, sadly, I will not be buying or playing this game. I'm not interested in being told that I can't reinstall a game more than ""n"" times after I've paid for it and OWN it. I've reinstalled C&C: Kane's Wrath about 7 times already, for various reasons - on one single machine. To have to PAY to call up EA and BEG them to allow me to install a game I bought is insulting, and I refuse to support my rights (including the right of first sale) being stripped away by greedy publishers.

So, I'll wait for EA to release a patch to remove this ridiculous DRM - or I'll make the sacrifice and not play this game, and I encourage you to do the same if you want PC gaming as we know it to survive.

I'm also very miffed by EA's deceptive marketing. If they want to force us to rent a game (that's what limited installs amounts to), the box should have a clear indication about the limitations that they're imposing and indicating that you're not actually buying the game. The fact that they choose to hide this from consumers makes me even less willing to fork over my money for this.

It's a game. I can do without it. And most of my friends can too. Deeply flawed"
1.0	"I was so exited about having the rumble feature on my PS3 that i bought the product the minute I saw it. Saddly, i had 5 minutes of rumble... since then i haven't been able to make it work.

Oh, and I still have the controller... broken. Broken Shockwave"
1.0	This game is the worst thing I've ever played.  CS= AWESOME!  The original Half-life= AWESOME!  The original team fortress (or whatever it was called) AWESOME!  All those games had extreme depth to them.  This game has NO DEPTH what so ever.  I just don't understand how valve could have lost their minds and made this junk?  This game just lacks any kind of strategy.  You run out and shoot then die.  Wait 22 seconds and repeat.  It's just as stupid as that. The worst lan game, EVER!
1.0	Don't buy this crappy game. I love being an arm chair GM but this aint it. Head Coach with Tony Dungy was a great game but unfortunately I played 3 full careers of it and had all of the draft classes memorized and knew how to get all the best players effortlessly. If you must have this version (like I did) find a way to get it for console. The controls suck for pc (not motionjoy compatible), the game is way to tedious and the graphics make my eyes hurt. Load screens after every day that passes, three disc game for pc and the fact it is an increasingly rare game which jacks up the price. I cant overstate how much of a garbage game this is. Listen to me, don't buy this game. Madden is a better coach/GM simulator than this. The most UNBEARABLE thing about this game is that the game is just so freaking old that the salary cap is basically from a different universe. Why does my starting FA RG rated 84 ovr want a 4 year, 5 million dollar contract? So I try to look around the league to see if that is reasonable compensation but the menus are so horribly jumbled and complicated, it makes me lose interest immediately. The cap numbers are insanely outdated and unrealistic. Pass this one. Do it or regret it. BUYER BEWARE

One problem it nothing like smackdown first of all there are only 2 modes a regular one on one match or a royal rumble where there can be 9 people in the ring at one time. Yes i know the royal rumble match sounds cool but it is as boring as a one  on one match. In other words this game gets one star for being fun for 5 minutes. fun for 5 minutes than boring
1.0	I bought Kinect for Christmas for my 2.5 year old daughter, mostly. And I have to say that it's been mostly fun - the painful moments have to do with signing in, Kinect ID and in general, making Kinect recognize the players. Several games fail miserably because of the difference between being Signed in, and Kinect recognizing the player. Moreover, there are a handful of OK/Cancel dialogs, where only Kinect controls work (controller and remote are not useful) - What the **** with that? Why can't I hit A button to dismiss a stupid dialog. The handwaving gets annoying pretty fast. Overall, when this thing works - it's great. When it doesn't - there are no words to describe the frustration. Frustrating hand waving

1.0	Worst game I have yet to play for ps4. It's like a bad GTA 4 mod. Driving is terrible, slidey cars. Hacking mechanics are not really deep in open world. Story is a godawful halfbaked mess with paper thin unrealistic characters and a nonsense revenge plot. Save your money, buy literally any other game. Terrible, horrible garbage.

When it did decide to work, it was very finnicky.
In the end, I decided that going through the process of exchanging this to get another one that may or may not work was just not worth the trouble for just 1 game. So I just used candles for the IR instead. Maybe it was just my model."

1.0	This game has some kind of program that causes sudden drops in framerate, freezes, and untimely loading actions, although the graphics are excellent, this game was poorly programed. I would like to know the people that programed this mess, to see if they are mentally retarded. This game does not have the looks, or feel of ubisoft. This game isn't anything like Silent Hunter 3. I have never given such a bad review as this, but I felt that I must , inorder to warn other gamers. there are a lot of first person shooters out there that is a lot better. The reviewer that stated something about having a crappy computer, let me tell you something, BOZO... I have a Gateway 550GR pentium 4, 3.4 gig processor with H/T ,over a gig of DDR overclocking memory, 200 gig hard drive, ati radeon pci EXPRESS 128 meg graphics card with all the bells and whistles. I have a top of the line computer, but I still have problems. This game needs a patch ASAP. As for the reviewer that stated that he has played it once, and now he is going to play it twice, he probably have the farcry cheats. I have the farcry cheats, and have finished the game also,with all the settings set to very high,and ultra high. YOU SEE AT THE VERY END OF THE GAME AFTER YOU KILL THE LAST SCIENTIST ON THE VOLCANO, YOU RESCUE THE FINE LADY, JUMP ON A SHIP, AND GIVE HER THE SERUM, THAT KEEPS HER FROM BECOMING A MUTANT, THE .....END. My reviiew will stay the same, the water doesn't look as good as the water in Blackhawk Down, doesn't even come close to the water in silent hunter3 OR Pirates of the Caribean, Thank You p.s. go to ...cheaters heavens, you will find a zip file, download this file to your desktop, then extract all to the farcry folder.,and have yourself some fun. Pitiful peace of mess
1.0	Does not work with my PC.  I have a high end PC, so I've tried compatibility mode, setting configurations, etc, but it won't work....plus it did not come with a product key. Add product key next time!
1.0	This headset is having the same issue my Xbox 360 A40 headset has had. I regret paying for the first pair. The product itself is great... only if you can get the cables from not shutting off half of your audio from normal wear and tear (for example, moving your head). It is a cabling scheme by Astro. Buy the headset, and pay overpriced costs on their cables. Cables that indefinitely break and I have had no better experience. I have cheaper electronics that never have a wiring / connectivity issue. This is not sufficient for the price. It doesn't seem like anything has changed from Astro company at all. I am really disappointed because when they do work, they work great. But again, I'm not buying new cables for the next two years. I shouldn't be hearing audio cut in and out on new cables. So as long as you keep your head straight and don't move, this product is for you. For people who don't move while gaming.

1.0	"I think my title and ""K""'s review says it all. Unless you've played SH games before, and/or are absolutely a survival/demented horror freak DO NOT BUY. RENT IF YOU ARE CURIOUS, then you'll only be disappointed in a small sum of money wasted.

I can't believe I wasted forty minutes of my life beated retarded dogs with metal poles. I was hoping it would get better or something, trying to find reason for wasting thirty-odd bucks on it...then a ghost showed up and I said Screw this crap. And I played good games like MK Deception and Burnout 3.

People need to get a reality check. Just cause video games are popular now more than ever, new and hyped don't mean good. Old school games like the original MK's, Tekken, old Wolfenstein (for its day), Doom 1 and Rainbow Six were the good stuff. And those arcade fighters, the side scrollers with big guy, the martial artist and the middle man were awesome in their day. And Diablo 2, don't get me started. All these games, IN THEIR DAY, were defining. Revoluntionary. FUN. Halo, Silent Hill, Midnight Club, Quake 2, Half-Life 1 were hyped yesterday and are being hyped today. Someone persuaded the masses somehow to buy them, and I got caught up in it.

Bring back games with imagination and - gasp - an actually satisfying fun factor. These days its hard to find the good ones (Burnout 3, MK Deception, Return to Castle Wolfenstein) amongst the throngs of retarted trash. Grand Theft what? Pixel porn and finding the best way to torture and mutilate people (Punisher, Manhunt). No wonder people think violence stems from video games. By removing the fun and innovation, that's all they got anymore! THIS GAME BLOWS PEOPLE. BLOWS. BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

1.0	The damned thing has never worked. Not one time. I carefully and properly cleaned it after being fed up with it, after trying any combination of tricks to get it to work -- tilting the cartridge, moving it from side to side, etc. -- and still, it refused to work. Nothing but a black screen on the Monitor and a golden cartridge that might as well be giving me the finger. Not satisfied. Not satisfied.
1.0	"This is in fact, my second review for XCX. I rewrote it to settle one thing once and for all and be done with this review. To start, to me, this is yet another garbage game. Which is wierd, since I actually like quite a bite of the Wii-U's titles that I've played. You as the consumer aren't entitled to like my opinion, but this isn't a discussion forum either. So I won't be disucssing this review once this review has been concluded. So now that this ugly business is out of the way, I shall continue.

1. The first thing I found myself doing is creating the character that I used for my rather short playthrough of XCX. Short, not because of the game being too short, but because I couldn't be excited enough to get rid of this garbage game. Character creation is at best confusing for someone like me, who has bad vision. While some things were clear, others were a bit confusing because of the nature of the game's interface. You create a character and choose their gender and basic appearance. It's funny that so many people argue about the boob slider, yet you cannot change any other part of the character's body aside from their size and facial components.

2. Navigation was just terrible for me. The camera in it's default setting was exacerbated by the poorly positioned and designed map. The first city that you come into contact with was also poorly designed. The wilderness on the other hand wasn't bad, but again, exacerbated by the poorly positioned and designed map. And putting a map on your gamepad doesn't help if you have bad vision. This is the whole point of my review, that this isn't the game I'd suggest if you have bad vision.

3. The interface is questionable at best in many ways. I've heard that you can customize them, yet it still doesn't change the fact that this is the FIRST thing you come into contact with. It doesn't work for me and could stand to be simplified without having the player to do the developer's work for them. The less you have to spend in menus, the better. It isn't the case at all with this game though.

4. The story itself is yet another ""alien race destroys the Earth or ruins the human race in some way"" plot. Your character has a voice, yet ironically you never use it ONCE in the whole story. So you are also reminiscent of the RPG heroes of old, that is not so fantastic...

5. I hated the music quite a bit. The one thing I actually like about JRPGs IS the music and this game didn't have ANYTHING that I call high quality. But while I don't like it, I wouldn't be so bold as to say that everyone will like it either. So it is strictly a personal decision. Though I should point out that people always critique voice acting, so this isn't any different in the grand scheme of things.

In the end, I can't say that my pros were plentiful enough to outweigh my cons. So I can't suggest this game to anyone with bad vision. If you're a huge JRPG fan with great eyes, then you will possibly like the game. But this is the review from someone with bad vision. Not for the visually broken."
1.0	It should be called MCP instead of MVP. I played 1 and 1/3 inning it was enough for me. Everytime I made contact it was a soft roller to 2nd, three straight times the same result. I got one out pitching, with a system that looked like making kick offs, which is difficult to master, how about doing it over 100 times? Three pitches one out, one Double and one Home Run I had enough. Graphics and player models look great, but it's no fun if you can't play the game with out being a hardcore game. Anyway Baseball has become so bad of lately, why spend 50 bucks in this game when there are better sports or action games less complicated specially if you don't have time to spare in order to play a video game. Most Complicated Play
1.0	"I'm sorry to say it because I am a huge fan of the Soul Calibur series, but this is just the worst edition in the series.  Period.  Single player modes are just inexcusable; there is no content and it will bore you after 30 minutes of play.  It feels more ""cartoonish"" than previous versions as well and seems to be a step backwards from IV (which was freaking awesome).  The characters that are left out is probably the worst part of the fifth addition, though the single player modes give stiff competition to that idea.  I'm returning it.  If you haven't played IV and are looking to give Soul Calibur a try, pick a copy of the 4th installment; it should be pretty cheap by now and is way, way better than 5.  Part 3 is still my favorite because of the battle map thing (I forget what it is called), but the ""tower of souls"" in part 4 was awesome. Worst in the series, not worth 60 bucks!"
1.0	"After playing this game for months, the game takes me back to level 34 from level 54 for no reason, meaning it erased 20 hard earned levels!  That was a disaster.  I was so disgusted, I didn't touch it for two months.  When I finally went back to it, the game updated (4GB).  At the end of the update, the game was rendered unplayable!  It now keeps looping and never gets past the initial screen!  So, my months of work on the game has been completely destroyed.  Now who is responsible for this calamity?  I want justice!
If I reinstall the game, and start from the very beginning, how do I know, it will not do this again, and erase my hard work again?  I have zero confidence in this game. It literally took away my spirit!  Amazon, stop selling this game because its programming code is defective! Update on November 17, 2016 broke the game!"
1.0	Probably the worst COD of the series. Even worst than Ghosts Expensive recycled garbage
1.0	This was a movie or a game?? Cinematics every 5 seconds... Gameplay is barely good. Max Payne 3 looks and feels like a movie not like a game... Did not like it... The only Rockstar game I hate is this! Boring
1.0	"if you are previous ace combat fan. then this one will disappoint you hard. there is this feature where ""you have to use it, if you want to complete the mission by killing lead pilots"", which are the main targets.
this feature is called dog fight. it automatically puts you close to the tail of the enemy and it automatically fallows the enemy. the only thing you have to do is not even point, but shoot.
this feature should have been only for people who don't know how to engage in dog fights. in other words people who don't know how to fly a fighter plane!!! automatic dog fight feature."

1.0	Worst game ever, your basically just going into the dungeon and collecting coins that you can't even use. There is no cool story or anything. The only thing I like is you can play as other characters but other than that it's a waste of time. Worst game ever
1.0	Description made it sound like full game but this is just a starter dlc pack. One Star
1.0	"1. No story. I don't mean single player, I mean like, a story.

2. Clunky, awkward gameplay. That's pretty common with these types of games where they put so much emphasis on ""cover."" It makes for non-fluid controls and movement. Very jagged like.

3. Boring. So far, very repetitive. All the enemies look the same. The action is the same.

4. There's modding and customizing (to some degree), but it doesn't make up for things.

5. It makes me mental when game studios try to make super realistic environments and gameplay, only to fail at the most obvious things. For example, in this game, it takes far to many headshot to kill an enemy. Kind of silly. Boring, Clunky Gameplay. Really Disappointed."
1.0	I am on beginner and get my butt kicked. The AI stamina hardly moves yet mine drops to nothing after 3 swings. I REALLY am disappointed. The controls are by far the hardest to use than any fighting game I have ever played. Can't imagine if I played on expert! SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1.0	I recognize 4 RE titles and those being 1,2,3 and code veronica, everything else is pure crap. Capcom, if you can't go back to the old RE style then i'm done with your series and I think most people will be too. The only way you can overcome this disaster that you've created is to make the next one like the originals and make resident evil 4 and 5 just a dream that Leon and Chris had. So, for the next one remember, go back to the old story and gameplay as well as real zombies. Please quit making these games.
1.0	"You can't invert the Y axis when it comes to moving the camera with the right stick. Game unplayable.

If you select to invert ""aim"", then yes...it will invert while you're fighting. (aiming)

But looking around during the game sucks if you're a player that is completely attuned to inverting your camera controls.

This alone made me not want to play the game.

How long would it take for a developer to add an option to invert the camera control? I'm assuming not that long at all. If enough thought wasn't put into the game to allow this option that most gamers have become accustomed to, then I will judge by that and assume not that much thought was put into the game in it's entirety. Y axis"
1.0	"I am a big fan of shooters and this really is an aweful shooter.
First, There are no tutorials. It has you decide the level of difficulty and immediatly has you playing the first level. There is no way to accustom yourself to the controls or gameplay.
There is no control for movement. The game forces you in stationary position, taking damage and all you can do is frantically move your crosshairs back and forth across the screen in hopes you will pass it over your target. The crosshairs move very fast and you frequently pass your target without hitting it. There is NO target locking system. As you move the crosshair across the screen to the left, it bounces back on it's own, altering your aim. They could have fixed this with a quick-flick style locking/targeting option.
There are boxes and items to shoot for health and weapons upgrades but the auto-camera moves your view around for you and frequently takes you out of the area the upgrade or health was, while at the same time sends swarms of monsters at you, damaging you.
This is why shooters should not be played on a console. With a mouse, on a PC it would have been much easier to aim and stay alive. Even on the easy level, it was frustrating and not a lot of fun.
As for the graphics, for the 360 I expected them to be better. It was not up to the standard I would have expected.
Plot..What plot. There is no story or narator to explain why this is hapening and this would have made the game more enjoyable. Aweful game"
1.0	"I was so excited for this game. So much potential, a vast universe to explore, a real and persistent universe you inhabit with other players. Ha. I was such a sucker. What I, and everybody else got, was a $60 screenshot simulator that lacked any form of persistent universe.

This game is the best scam of the 21st century, and the fact that it has fans rabidly defending lighting their money on fire is proof that Hello Games totally got away with it. I wish Sean Murray asked for consent before he screwed me."

As for the pro's of the game. It's a MGS game!  It starts out awesome with a great mission to escape a hospital. The graphics are awesome, sound tracks are good, voice acting is great too. Even load times are great, you can quickly get to the next boring mission.

Now for the cons:
Open world is not so open, your missions keep repeating the same boring villages again, and again. (Anyone remember Dragon Age II) - Once you capture a base, 3 missions later you're going back (base no longer captured) this time for some other stupid objective like rescue a sheep.
Too much time went into base management stuff.  Too much ""collecting of stuff"" required. It's like Hideo tried to combine RDR, FAR CRY, MGS, DAII all into one messy game that makes things more of a chore than fun. It's like Far Cry, without the fun."
1.0	Absolutely terrible game. Fake teams, fake stadiums, graphics look terrible. NO INSTANT REPLAY...are you kidding me? Horrible game that should have never made it to shelves. I hope this game only sells 2 copies, which would probably satisfy the entire rugby fanbase. You have been warned. GARBAGE
1.0	One of the most boring Nancy Drew games I have ever played. It looked interesting at first, so I decided to give it a try, but was disappointed. I hated how there was no character development (only two other people on the island and one of them is George). Not much of a mystery, slow gameplay, the puzzles are annoying. I would avoid. No
1.0	the code wasn't working the code wasn't working
1.0	Expected a lot more from bungie. This game requires a constant internet connection to use. And it wasn't that fun to play. And it wasn't that fun to play
1.0	Yet another game I've purchased -spent the time to download it, all to find to play it beyond the 60 minutes I must pay the company another $9.99 not a good purchase thats for sure. I warn all who try to purchase this game stay far away from this one and any other that comes from the same download company 99 not a good purchase thats for sure
1.0	"This game is an embarassment to the power of the PS2 console. The graphics looks like psx graphics. The handling is the worst. The tracks are narrow. The games loading takes a long time. The so called car settings are minimal. The AI on hard mode are doing some ridiculous lap times. I am sorry I would not recommend this game to anybody. It had a lot of potential and asssitance should have been sought in the games' development.
I am sorry the truth is the truth. LE MANS FAIL TO EXCITE"
1.0	We've played Halo 1-4 co-op split screen all the way through and it's the only game she'll play and she'll only play splitscreen. We were both mildly heartbroken when they pulled this option. Definitely not going to buy unless they release a patch which is too bad because it was fun watching my beautiful bride take out flood with a shot gun :) Halo got my wife into video games
1.0	The installation disc has a typographical error in one of the programs, so I copied the disc to a folder on my desktop, renamed the offending file and installed the program from there. However, the activation code failed a half-dozen times even though I have a Steam account. The disc is useless. The seller, Penelope Family Store, never responded to my email. Back it goes for a refund. Disc was nothing but trouble
1.0	"I don't know who they made this game for but it wasn't the 4 -5 year old. I thought since this game was about Shrek it would be suitable for little folks. It isn't. There is something about the camera angles on this game that may even the simplest task difficult. The game mechanics stink!

My little guy ended up trying to do a simple task (climbing boxes) and fell down so many times I had to do it for him. Did I succeed? No!

The perspective of this game is odd and you can't really tell how high you are jumping or even figure out where you will land. End result, mounds of frustration.

It's almost as if the developers had a weird sense of humor and made the game control as difficult as they could.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game for players under the age of 7 and I don't even know if they would be able to play it.

Horrible game! Game is too hard for pre-schoolers!"
1.0	"The game is not fun. After all the hype, I got the game. Did not play any of the BF before, so this is first experience. Went straight to multiplayer without campaign - it is completely not interesting. Here is the situation: the maps are huge, all destructible objects do not provide a good hide-out, a lot of grass, bushes, trees and hills and everyone is in camouflage as result players are completely invisible. I have a lot of experience on other FPS and like a lot Counter Strike, Killzone on PS3, Borderlands 2, but this multiplayer is something! 99.9% you shall be just killed out of nowhere by a person you do not even see and have no chance of seeing him before he kills you out of some remote spot on a hill hidden by bushes with a sniper rifle - there is absolutely no space for individual game and duels. As result you just get killed and respawned, and then same story repeats and repeats and repeats. Using vehicles is also pretty lame - you could get into a jeep and get killed or get into a tank and shoot randomly at targets in the hope of killing someone by an explosion (again, you can not see camouflaged players and distringuish your team from opposing team) and not facing another tank, in which case all shall depend if you have a round in the barrel or need to reload.

In terms of stability - in about 5 hours of constant deaths on multiplayer the game crashed only once, which is an ok statistics. I have AMD card, so this could be the reason. So overall, if you are BF fan, you could try this out, but if you would expect something like Killzone multiplayer on PS3 - do not try this game. Why is no one saying multiplayer is not interesting?"

1.0	"Good product but flawed (I may have simply received a defective product, 1 in a million, eh?). Here is a BIG complaint with this mouse, the ""trigger"" on the top left and right buttons is a hair trigger setup which cannot be changed. You think that's good? Not really so because the slightest touch on the right button activates it and regardless of what you have it set to do, reload your weapon, throw a grenade, etc., it stops the primary action and does the secondary, and, as the primary action is almost always (the left button) really urgent like shooting something, guess what ... yup ... you got it ... you stop shooting and activate the secondary action, and if your opponent is any good you are dead. I grew to HATE this mouse over a couple weeks of use. And, btw, we almost never leave 1 star reviews. Flawed button design"
1.0	"Completely spazzes out and starts flying left or right all the time.

Very sticky, slightly unresponsive, and frequently glitches or isn't recognized. Doesn't really work."
1.0	"There was no mention at all that this game installs STEAM in the background, a program and service nowhere mentioned on the box.

There is apparently no way to play this game without STEAM.

It includes a DRM type also nowhere mentioned or even documented on the box or in the information pamflet.

It is the job of packaging and games to include the fact that you are not just installing a game, but a whole service and a secondary program which you cannot remove unless you remove the game too. Not playable without STEAM"
1.0	Didn't fit especially well. Had a cheap feeling. Not too great. Nothing specolial
1.0	"Stay away! Not worth installing. Boring characters, boring mission. Dumb because linear, only one path to walk, and one way to go. Does not even start to motivate slaying the things that come along. The only good thing is 2 player co-op. But again, still boring. Prefer Tomb Raider GOL or Kane & Lynch for co-op.
Feels like copied elements from all the good games of the past, coming together as a waste of time. Dumb and boring"
1.0	I was able to play my city once... and only once... the game crashes when trying to load it after the first time playing. Pretty lame. Pretty lame.
1.0	"This is absolutley terrible, what were they thinking? The graphics alone rank! I shouldn't even refer to them as graphics but rather ""cartoon"" graphics. The mission and storyline are bogus and lame. I dare anyone who says this is a great game to play EA's Two Tower or Return of the King then play this one.
If you don't mind wasting your money, then go for it and buy it, but if you want great games that enhance the LOTR book and movies, go and buy EA's Two Towers and Return of the King. Vivendi GO HOME, EA knows how to make a game"
1.0	"The main menu is nice looking. Not sure about anything after that as starting a new game hangs the computer. i haven't even seen the first cut scene.

i did the standard ""i play games on a PC"" thing - download latest drivers, instal patches, Google for hours, read the support forums, etc. It seems like spending hours trying to figure out why a game won't work is a part of the PC gaming experience, which as i was reading the 30th ""yeah, i get that exact same error but i also can't find a workaround and the company won't respond to forum posts or emails"" i realized was pretty sad. Some games crash occasionally (Dark Messiah), some frequenty (SiN Episode 1), some are unconscionably laggy (Mass Effect) and some work perfectly (Half-Life 2, Gears of War, Oblivion, Neverwinter Nights 2, at least on my new computer, etc.). TimeShift is the first one where i have never, ever even seen the game run in any way, shape or form. i wondered why a game so many people said they liked was being sold so cheap. Yes, the game is old, but even old games these days sell for at least $20. Now i know. The game has been out long enough that all tech problems should be patched now but i'm finding plenty of people having problems and all of them have exactly the same error with the same error message that's 100% reproducible and not one person has gotten it working - that sounds to me like the problem that is easiest to solve (widely seen, perfectly reproducible).

For the record, my PC is well above min specs. XP 32 bit, dual core 3000, 8800GTX, 4GB RAM, etc.

For my part, i think 6 hours is enough of my time trying to make a game work. Considering what i make per hour, this game has wasted enough of my time that i can buy a console where i know the games work. It's not worth making this game worth. It's going in the trash.

A recommendation for others that i wish i had thought of earlier - a lot of people are saying the demo for this game freezes. If you're considering this game, find the free demo and see if you can run it. If so, maybe it's worth risking buying this game. i wonder what the game is like"
1.0	"I know when this game came out there were a million issues at first like being unable to play online, fight money not working (It's April 1st and it still doesn't work), online lobbies only having one vs one, and a bunch of issues I won't even bother with. This game is not complete yet. I strongly recommend avoiding it until Capcom finally gets their **** together. This game was quite clearly rushed and still has many issues.

As far as the gameplay, it's decent. My biggest beef with this is that it really lacks the fun factor of USF4. There were so many different types of combos you could do in that game where as in this it feels limited. Maybe I didn't go as deep into it, but oh well. First impressions are really big for me. Ultra Street Fighter 4's launch was bad, but not this bad. Due to the fact of the fight money system not working, Capcom I guess tried to redeem themselves by giving away the first DLC character for free. That alone will not excuse the awful launch (they beta tested the game's online for months and still had a piss-poor launch). I'm not going to excuse Capcom any longer. I'm totally done with SFV.

Way to totally ruin Street Fighter. This game is awful. The fact that many Capcom fan-boys (I WAS one) excuse their awful business practices and try to pretend that having a half playable game is acceptable at launch (then again this is the norm with some games) just makes it worse. I wanted to give this two stars at least, but the fact I waited so long for SFV after four updates for SFIV (I bought Super, Arcade, and Ultra multiple times) and just had my hopes and dreams of playing a worthy follow up to SFIV just to get this piece of **** really makes my blood boil. If I could give a lower rating I totally would. My biggest regret is buying a digital copy--because now I can't sell it. Capcom Fanboy tired of Capcom"
1.0	The Nintendo 3DS allows you to use SDHC cards which can be found at much larger capacity for lower prices. Sony has intentionally used a proprietary format to rip off consumers. Do not be fooled, buy the Nintendo 3DS instead. Too Expensive

1.0	Characters are small.  Nothing like a starter set. Lame
1.0	In fact, it is very disappointing to series going down hill. Nothing innovative anymore. I remember original Halo was such a great name, I stay all night finish it. Now it is nothing but garbage. COD MW 1&2 make this gameplay like a childplay. Rent it if you want. Last two Halo games are very average.
1.0	"After almost 12 years since Diablo II, this game should have been ready for release, but it isn't.  The server problems are even more severe than during the beta test a few weeks ago; the US servers crashed soon after release and haven't yet been brought back online... a sad situation for a company that has been making its living online with their recent (huge) releases.  Nevertheless, a few hours of gameplay gave me a fair impression of the game; it's moderately fun but not really challenging or rewarding.
You run around on linear missions slaughtering easy hoards and a few bosses.  It was great fun in Diablo and Diablo II (both of which I still play occassionally), but uninspired this time around.  As you level up, you can't really customize your characters because there aren't any skill trees (leveling up seems to only unlock predefined skills).  Blizzard does allow you some customization... you can pick the design and color of your banners! FUN!  Like everybody else, I haven't had much play time because of Blizzard's server issues, but it appears that the game doesn't spawn new or different enemies as you take different characters through acts.
The real purpose of the game seems to be connecting players to the auction houses.  Blizzard won't let you play without being connected to their servers because ""you might want to visit the auction house"".  The main motivation to visit the auction house appears to be to try to get something, anything, to make your character unique because there certainly isn't anything that you're going to pick up in the early levels that is unique, the NPC merchants have nothing to offer, and the absence of skill trees results in boring, stock characters.
Wait a few months.  When the price drops to 30% of its current level it might be a worthwhile investment, but at the current price it is a real rip-off.
UPDATE...  Blizzard keeps tweaking the game, which should lead to an improved experience, but it doesn't.  While the servers have stabilized, the game play has gotten worse. The game has gone from being ridiculously easy to insanely difficult. Suddenly the monsters surround your character so there is no escape and they can kill you with two blows. I went from never dying in the first week of release to now dying almost every time I respawn.  There's no enjoyment in either extreme.
Again, I loved the first two Diablo games but I'm growing to hate this one.  I'm about ready to uninstall the game and accept that Blizzard simply ripped me off. Dropping a star from overall rating, but would really like to lower the ""fun"" rating (for some reason Amazon won't allow us to edit that part of the review). Not Ready For Prime Time...and getting worse!"
1.0	This set is cheap chinese crap.  The gun is the best part. The statue is cheap and breaks easily. The button is nothing more than a gimmick. The limited edition spinning case will only serve to make your girlfriend dump you or keep you from having one. This set is junk
1.0	This is the exact same game as the other games. There's a few new items, but nothing to celebrate. Sure it's a conclusion, but you just spent 200 bucks on 4 games that are all 12 hours(maximum) long. Way to go! The exact same as the other games.

I have a medium sized Head and they just snapped at the top at random. When I purchased these I ignored the other reviews thinking that it must be the neglect or misuse of these causing people to break them. I was completely wrong. I CONTACTED SONY WHO REFUSED TO REPLACE THESE AS AMAZON ONLY OFFERS 30 DAYS RETURN. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SONY HEADSET BECAUSE THEIR REFUSAL TO REPLACE A PRODUCT THAT CARRIES A WARRANTY IS APPALLING.

These headphones are also really tight. It is almost ridiculous how tight these are. THESE WERE PAINFUL FOR ME AND I DON'T HAVE A HUGE HEAD.

You: Hi I purchased your sony silver ps4 headphones 2 months ago
You: I have used them like 3 times before they broke while i was wearing them
Enrico: I'd be happy to look into this for you today. Although you have entered information about a SEN account before this chat, could you please provide the following to confirm the *exact* account you need assistance with?

enrico: can you tell me more about how the headset broke?
You: sure i was wearing it and the top of the band broke in half
You: these have never been neglected and were used like 3 times
Enrico: Thanks very much for the information and sorry for the wait time
Enrico: In this case the damage was caused by use
You: correct the product broke under normal use
Enrico: based on the description of what happened the service doesn't qualify with this product.
You: what service ?
You: these should not break like that
You: I spend thousands on sony products
You: this is the only product that was made this poorly
Enrico: Thanks for the feedback, I'll be escalating this situation to the proper department and investigate the quality of the product. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
You: Yes you can replace my headset under its 1 year warranty
You: where the product is supposed to be free of defects
You: if it broke under normal non abusive use
You: IT IS not FREE OF DEFECTS!
Enrico: As I mentioned before, this product doesn't qualify for service
You: Why does this product not qualify for service ?
Enrico: I explained that before: In this case the damage was caused by use
You: Dude
You: They broke on my head
You: while i was wearing them for the 3rd time
You: they were brand new!!!!!!!!!!!
You: thats not just wear and tear caused by use
You: If you cant replace them. Please put me intouch with your manager
Enrico: In chat we don't have managers. At least do you have the proof of purchase?
You: yes I purchased on amazon
You: i definately have proof of purchase
Enrico: send it and let me see what I can do for you
Enrico: Thanks, after reviewing the case and this is physical damage and we don't cover this kind of incident with headsets. Have a Great Day. Thanks for chatting with us THESE WERE PAINFUL FOR ME AND I DON'T HAVE A HUGE HEAD"
1.0	"I bought the Ghostbusters PC version.  Installed successfully and loaded properly.  However, after the initial cinematic scene and intro scene, the game freezes.  The freeze happens before you even get a chance to play.  Also, the game freeze is so bad that you have to reboot your whole computer.  Contacting the company, Atari, does no good; been waiting a week with no response.  Note: The computer that I use exceeds the minimum requirements to play.

The point: The game is probably good, but PC users are out of luck.  If you are using a PC to play games do not buy Ghostbusters. Game Crashes After Intro..."

But being a huge fan of The Sims and Sims2, I thought I'd buy it because living in a huge city, I hoped it would parallel and be fun -- Sims-style.

Ugh. It is so not.

If you're one of those people, like me, who hate going out to big clubs and watching people fawn (fake-fake-fake!) over some celeb-du-jour or some musician, or someone who's SOMEONE ... ugh ... then this game isn't for you.

It's about ladder climbing, and about who you know, not what you know. It's about kissing butt (something I have a hard time doing), and being a ""player"" ....

This is beyond my generation. I think teenagers and maybe young adults into their early 20s might like this game. Or anyone who likes playing THE game -- then give it a shot.

Otherwise, don't waste your money. Perhaps this isn't for my age group"

1.0	"Soul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake! The game looks great and sounds great, but its too easy. The game that is supposed to be the game for ""die hard fighting fans"" is basically a walk in the park. The game is a button masher! I played the game and found that ""turtling up"" and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings.
My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines. No God fearing person should touch this ""demon sword wielding"" game (I began to discover the different plots after I played it). I'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game. What sick minds came up with this anyway?
If the game had a better plot (one that involved some thought) then it would be a classic, but as it stands...no. The game looks great but..."
1.0	"Quick Review -

Presentation - This is the only decent part of the game. I like the characters and the story is decent. 5/10

Sound - The sound effects are decent. The music is well..Star wars. 6/10

1.0	"The game, when it works is ok, but it crashes and freezes so often, I no longer play it.

MLB is clearly the redheaded step child of 2K sports games. It consistently freezes when you try to skip the ""clutch moment"" cinematic and sometimes when you watch the darn thing at the end of the game. Freezes isn't the right word, it goes to the batting setup but the pitch NEVER comes, and the ""set your Xbox clock to some day in June 2012"" fix is crap, Doesn't work. It sometimes freezes when base running.

It is a reload of a yearly sports game offering. It's not much different than 11 or 2k13. Both are reportedly buggy as heck too, although I'll probably never buy a 2K sports game again, even being a fan of the NBA games. Is it really that hard to make a game that works?"
1.0	Excellent.  What I was expecting. The right item
1.0	"Alright, let me say this flat out just to spare you a lot of time

YES, this game DOES have evil secuROM DRM hidden in the software, but that is =>NOT<= the sole reason why I gave this game 1 star overall.

I have been a long time GTA fan, playing the series way back in the day when the original birds eye view game came out in the late 90s. Time and time again, rockstar has proved its expertise in making an expansive satirical game ahead of its time.

However, on this PC port, Rockstar and Take2 Interactive have seriously dropped the ball.

The game is undeniably addicting, and provides amazing possibilities for game play. The graphics are gorgeous, the world is expansive, and there are a ton of new features which would be a dream come true for me if there was not one teeny flaw with this production:

This PC port should still be in its alpha stages.

Its been nearly a decade since I've bought a game so riddled with errors, sloppy programming, and altogether looks like the afterbirth of console title. Clearly this title was prematurely pushed out just to sneak it in time for the holiday season. To give you a solid idea of what is wrong with the game, let me give you some hard examples of the flaws in its design.

#1- All PC versions of the game have SecuROM (Yes, even the Steam version that I bought. Effectively this means 2 DRMs)
#2- Your high end 2000 dollar PC will struggle to turn out more than 40 fps due to bad programming (I should know, my computer gets around 35 fps. See my specs below)
#3- You are required to register with TWO online accounts (three if you use steam). How much money do you think Take 2 Interactive is getting from selling your consumer rights by forced registry?
#4- Does not work with SLI, has many rendering problems, and the solution is to use a beta driver which in my case BRICKED my computer.
#5- Does not work well with background programs. (Many people recommend shutting down key security programs like your firewall or anti-virus.)
#6- Several errors with multiplayer (remember those 2 mandatory online registration processes, they don't work too with multiplayer)

This is hogwash. I hope this shoddy work bites the corporate executive who forced this game out so quickly. I'd much rather have waited a year and had all these issues removed.

I'd like to rant right now about how Rockstar should have learned from EA's Spore and SecuROM, but apparently over 100 other reviewers have that one well covered, so I'll spare you.

Here are my tech Specs I promised
nForce 790i Ultra SLI Motherboard

1.0	"I'm a huge halo fan, I've beaten and played every installment since I was 9 years old and I'm now in my 20's. Yes, every single one of them. Halo 1, 2, 3, ODST, 4, and Reach. But the only one that has left an absolute vile taste in my mouth was Halo 5. All things considered, whether you are a Halo fan or not, Halo 5 is an atrocious game and I wouldn't dare recommend it to anyone new or old to the series.

Both Campaign and Multiplayer experiences are stale and prematurely delivered in a bundled package that was served by Microsoft for an easy cash grab. And even as of writing this review they(Microsoft) are trying to gobble up as much cash as they can from Halo 5 before they send it to its grave with the reveal of the next Halo(which should be at E3 this year).

To settle the old argument of whether I have played my fair share of this game, yes, I've played it plenty. Still, my opinion stands. I've reached Champion at least 4 times so far. In Snipers, Slayer, HCS, and Doubles. Up to Champion 29. So it's safe to say I have put the hours in. But looking back, I regret it all. Because the experience this game has given has not been a fun one.

As of writing this Halo 5's population has dwindled down to nearly nothing and they have opened up the ranking system due to lack of players. So you will match any rank, high or low, regardless of your own rank. You will always match against teams of 4 nearly every game as most people don't search solo, so good luck on that front.

If you are a poor soul that is looking to pick up Halo 5 for some enjoyment, please don't. Don't waste your harddrive space, don't waste your time with it. I'm ashamed that 343 has failed so miserably.

Halo 5 is just not fun, not at all. 343 Ruined This One, A Cash Grab"
1.0	Worst game I've ever played. One Star
1.0	"This game contains a virus called ""secuROM"" that permanently installs itself into your OS and can disable your drives (as it did mine) and should be avoided at all costs. It's a shame. I played Bioshock on a friends 360 and was blown away. The cool retro 50's look of the underwater city and the music set over the dark and creepy atmosphere made for a great gaming environment. It has an original and thoughtful story and the endless attack combos and multiple endings gives this game a very high replay value as well. I was very exited to get this for PC as mouse/keyboard is the best set up for a FPS by far. I was crushed when I found it had installed a virus that crippled my virtual drives. Removing secuROM from my system was a lengthy nightmare that involved risky registry editing that can damage your system permanently if not done exactly right.
 Bioshock is a great game that contains a virus. Buy the 360 version if you want to play it.
5 stars for a fun game

1.0	These are NOT Xbox 360 cabels utter waste of my time and disappointment to my daughters Christmas.. The packaging is even wrong!! THESE ARE FOR THE ORIGINAL XBOX NOT 360 cables original Xbox!
1.0	This is the worst game I have ever played on the Playstation. It takes way too long to load, the gameplay is slow, and the graphics are just terrible! I can knock my opponent over the head numerous times and he'll just stand there! I could hit my special until I couldn't no more and throw him off the top of the Hell In a Cell. Then I could hit all my specials again and pin him and guess what? I WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO GET A FREAKIN' ONE COUNT! Then you have to dive halfway across the wrestling ring just to get the darn championship belt in a ladder match. You can't 3-D anybody through a table either. THAT STINKS! The only ways you can drive them through a table is: Powerbomb, Piledriver, Rock Bottom, or a top rope move!!! Gosh, that really stinks! And in the Season Mode it will make you do all sorts of B.S. loading just so it can say: '(Whoever) Is here tonight'! or '(Whoever) seems satisfied with the victory'! That is downright pathetic and very exhausting! The game freezes sometimes and loads too much. DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH! Rent it, but PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS GAME! SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE! ... TERRIBLE!
1.0	Forced to be run like xbone version. Which is garbage. Returned and will not play. Down with parity. Xbone is weak, garbage hardware and ps4 should have been lead design platform. Forced to be run like xbone version
1.0	"Okay, honestly, if you are expecting a portable version of Madden to play that is at all equivalent to the console version you have at home, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  It is not even close to the Madden 2006 available for console gaming.  The load times are attrociously horrible.  I mean horrible.  The graphics are like stepping back to the last PS1 version of Madden.  Compared to other EA Sports games for the PSP like the 2006 NBA basketball game, Madden is nothing close.  Nothing close at all.

...not to mention the freezing....

The game freezes for roughly 2-3 seconds everytime the following events take place:

-a touchdown is scored

-an interception is made

-a 4th down is forced

-a fumble occurs

Oh yeah, and also, literally 1/2 the time that you try to make a kick, the power meter either fails to show up and you have to call a timeout in order to reload because the game froze...or, if it does show up, it's only 1/2 way visible and it is darn near impossible to make your kick with any power or accuracy.  This game is all around pitiful.  Except...no, it's not, I can't have pity on something that is inexcusably horrible.  Please do not buy this game.  Save your money for something else because this Madden is absolutely no fun to play.  No fun at all. Very Poor Quality"
1.0	"Girlfriend played it twice. She didn't care for the song selection. They are Latino based and not US chart toppers. She'd rather use Dance Central or Just Dance as she knows and enjoys the songs.

Would not recommend. Poor Song Selection"
1.0	"The game itself was fun, but seemed quite a bit shorter than the original.  It had the feeling of an add-on; nothing really new or unique enough to make it better.  It was much more stable on my PC than the original, though.  I had only a single crash at an oil refill station.

But this DRM stuff is really insane.  People who pirate are going to steal the game.  Period.  I'm sure that an hour after it got released, the first cracked versions started appearing on the torrent sites.  But for the honest people who pay the honest cash for the game, the idea of limited installs, mandatory on-line registration, and forcing a Microsoft account down your throat is too much.

Just to give you an idea of the hoops you need to jump through, my game is fully installed, yet to play it I need the original DVD in my drive, plus I need to be online, plus I need to be logged into Windows Live.  Remember the good old days when all you needed was a serial number or looking up the 4th word of the 3rd line of page 78 of your users guide?  Well, you STILL have to enter a 25-digit key as part of a lengthy installation...  Seriously, if you have to be logged on and monitored during your entire gaming session, what's the point of having the original disk in your drive or entering an authentication key?

Is the next step of ""copy protection"" monitoring my specific playing style so that the game can be shut off remotely if my friend starts playing it?  How about forcing me to buy a (Microsoft, natch) webcam and keep it trained on my face to ensure a legitemate user is playing?  I've probably said too much...sorry if this happens on Bioshock 3.

Big Daddies?  Big Sisters?  This is Big Brother to an unpleasant degree.

I recommend the XBox version over the PC version just because of the intrusive Securom. Add me to the anti-DRM list"
1.0	Even though I received this game for Christmas, I still feel as if I've been cheated. Talk about the dullest, unimaginable game in history. I'll admit the graphics are upgraded, but the puzzles are about as complicated as connect the dots, and the characters have slightly different play styles...and I mean SLIGHT. Their combos, seeing as hacking and slashing is all they improved on Gauntlet, are almost identical. Oh, and forget magic. Each character gets one radius spell, and a couple, silly moves. They completely eliminated elemental magic and collecting vials. Unlike any other Gauntlet game ever made, there are no secrets. NONE. There are no power ups. There's no evolution of the characters either, except minimal changes when you find golden chests. Problem is, once you find four for each armor and weapons, the changes stop. What confuses me, is how 'Legacy' could be so entertaining just holding down a button and 'Sorrows' can be so boring. Seeing as I don't have Online, I can't comment on how that is, but I doubt the game is somehow expanded. If you get this game, expect two areas per level and a boss fight, which are extremely short, instead of Legacy's five areas and a boss fight which involved finding magical relics. That gives Legacy a total of about fifty levels to Sorrows' twelve. Having waited so long for this release, I'm embarrassed to be a Gauntlet fan. Great job, guys. I'm gonna go chain myself to a tree and wait for the Apocalypse. Disappointing and Boring
1.0	Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west. The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan. Built on a outdated engine with wonky physics, Dated graphics and a 2.5D design. Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI. Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies, Find key, Open door, Shoot more baddies, Find another Key ect ect. Outlaws is very dissapointing. Outlaws
1.0	"Have spent dozens, maybe hundreds of hours, dealing with the myriad problems I've dealt with this machine since 1 month in, when I got the dreaded but all too common red lights of death and had to send it into Microsoft.  I'll just list all the problems:

1) Red lights of death a month into ownership, after not having so much as scratched it and with moderate use.  Talked to Microsoft then had to send it into them.  Took 2 months for them to send me a refurb replacement.

2) from the moment I got the replacement, my game discs would not load correctly one third of the time, for which I have to eject disc, manually reposition, then re-insert.

3) Halo 3 map pack which I purchased separately not loading, except for one day (7 on the 7th for those who played Halo 3) of the month.  After hours of trying to figure out problem on the phone with MS reps, no resolution.

4) Xbox controller sticky analog shift only 6 months in, still no fix

5) Windows media player unable to sync

6) Not all codecs for Video Player downloading

7) Netflix requiring you to manually input your username and password each time you log in because I used a different Netflix account to log in initially (this only happens on the Xbox). Extermely annoying.

8) LOUD fan.  So loud I finally had to put it behind my bureau and cover/surround it with blankets,pillows just so the noise which is still loud is bearable.  Then it overheats and I get one red light of death (only one Microsoft?)

Each of these problems required scouring the Internet for possible solutions, talking to MS reps on phone, then physically attempting to fix the problem if applicable.  MS reps are completely oblivious, takes at least half an hour to wait and have to explain the problem before they even understand what the problem is.  In addition, when my Xbox Live subscription expired they attempted to do a bait and switch by first offering me 1 month for $1 and then another year for $20 on phone, I learned later it was $30 and they of course had no record of the conversation and talked as though *i* was the one who tried to ip them off.  No joke.

I've given up playing games and at this point I just wanted something to watch videos and video apps on my TV. Because of above problems, I can't.

I will have to buy a PS3 very soon.

For not only the money but of equal importance the time, energy and stress i spent on the myriad problems, i strongly recommend against buying it, as 54% - yes, more than half - of all Xboxes malfunction.  And that's not counting the smaller problems like map packs not loading or Netflix requiring you to log on each time that will cause you endless hassle.

I will never buy an Xbox again, whether this generation or the next.

Have only owned this machine for over a year and that's PROBLEMS"
1.0	"The low rating doesn't come just because of the fact that the game is 6 years old.  The graphics are excellent, especially impressive given the sheer size of the world (and that you can view it hundreds of feet from the air, anywhere.

The game has a very ambitious design: a massive sandbox action game.  unfortunately, they developer just wasn't up to the task.

It starts out with small things: cars popping in right in front of you, or getting out of your car to pickup up an item 10 ft away, and finding the car gone when you turn around because the game decided to wipe out and refresh all the vehicles on the map suddenly.  Then there's the memory leak error: extended gameplay (~30-45 minutes) causes the game to start having massive hiccup & stuttering errors.

The vehicle handling (especially cars) is something best likened to trying to juggle wet turds.  They can't go straight even on a straight away.  Car stopping obstacles are all made of super-magnets, because your car will veer into them if you get close.  Vehicle behavior is pretty screwed up:
 - Whenever another faction is ""after you"" every other entity on the map (i.e. normal civilians) will try and run you off the road.
 - When enemies swerve and try to block you and you Tee-bone them, it will stop your car dead.  If an enemy hits you the same way, he will not slow down in the slightest, and will carry you with him whatever direction he was going until you hit a wall/obstacle or abandon the vehicle
 - Hit even the slightest bump in the road and you will go flying, even at low speeds.  If you tried to park a car in a driveway with this game's physics you'd fly 30 ft in the air as soon as you touched the curb, land on the roof and the car would explode.
- One of the more common ways to die in this game is simply...exiting a vehicle.  The will often times spend 5-10 seconds settling after you come to a complete stop.  Get out to soon and there's a good chance the car resettling will simply crush you and kill you.

Speaking of common deaths, in the first half of the game, my most common death was during liberation missions where you get a bunch of allies.  One would eventually come speeding from behind in a car and run me over.  I learned to keep a constant vigilance on my rear end eventually.  You allies are more dangerous to you than most of your enemies.

You can airdrop vehicles for yourself which is a cool idea except:
- You can't do it when in/near a town.
- You can't do it when under fire
- You can't do it sometimes...just because.  No explanation on why or how to get to the point where you can get one.
- Sometimes it comes in about 20 seconds...sometimes it takes 4-5 minutes.  sometimes it just never comes.
- Sometimes when it does finally come.....it just doesn't work.  it's like the battery's dead or something.

Du

I could spend a couple terabytes explaining all the problems with this game.  Whoever came up with the game concept had an awesome idea on their hands.  Unfortunately, it suffers from a terrible implementation.  Avoid this game.  Hopefully the second one is better. Ambitious Game - Bad Execution.  Really Really Bad"
1.0	"If you only have a PC, then DO NOT buy this game! Save your money for Bad Company 2. And if you don't want to wait that long for your money to rack up without a good FPS online game, just buy Battlefield 2. It is almost the same as Bad Company but without destructible environments. The graphics on Bad Company are slightly better than Battlefield 2, but they BOTH will make your blood pressure spike if you are in a good online match on both Battlefield games.

If you have a PS3, Modern Warfare 2 is a good choice IF you have more than one controller. Local Multiplayer is REALLY FUN on PS3 with MW2, but Bad Company 2 is good too. Both are good games on PS3, but Battlefield: Bad Company 2 PWNZ MW2 on PC. Don't own the game, but is WAY better on PS3 than PC"
1.0	Mic pops and crackles at any volume. It sucks! I purchased these when I watched a bunch of reviews on youtube. I have to say these are crap. I recommend Sades Stereo 7.1  for the PS4. Sades Stereo 7.1  are USB. It sucks balls!
1.0	Glad I didn't buy it. Zero stars. Should be a lawsuit. Someone should sue Bethesda
1.0	"After being burnt on game after game- Morrowind- Black and White- Civ 3- all highly-touted games that failed to deliver even the slightest degree of gameply enjoyment, I decided to stick my neck out and purchase Freedom force- ""what the hey?""  I thought- ""The law of averages will eventually yield up a decent game, and I've heard good reviews...""
  Needless to say- Burned again!
  Freedom force is an abysmal little game- a horrendous, cumbersome interface that makes gameplay confusing and erratic.  Enemies that can run off the edge of the map and attack you at a distance- yet cannot be attacked.  Your ""Heroes"" might as well be named ""Idiot man and Stupid boy"", as they will stand idly around at let themselves be attacked and shot at, and not defend themselves.  Graphic glitches out the wazoo.  You have to click on an enemy sometimes as many as four times before your hero will attack...
  Seriously- I've been playing video and computer games for 18 years- ever since the first ""Ultima"" game came out for the apple 2- and I have never seen such an onslaught of inferior products being foisted into the market...
  What has happened to the art of game design?  Because from what I can tell, it has died. Whatever happened to the art of game design?"
1.0	The item I received, while it is an Energizer Xbox One charger, does not match the one depicted in the Amazon store. The box image is different and so is the product itself. The cradle seems smaller and does not have the clear plastic parts holding the controllers in place by their tops and glowing green. It is plainer and has simple green light bands on the lower front of the design. The one I wanted also looked matte white to match the controllers. This one is shiny. I chose to buy this one over cheaper ones because of the aesthetics of its design and what I got is not the same. The item I received, while it is an Energizer ...
1.0	It doesn't even play Xbox 360 games..... One Star
1.0	"I will start this review in saying that I was actually unable to even PLAY the game.  This is due to the fact that the product description is a lie!  This game DOES NOT SUPPORT Guitar Hero peripherals.  Follow the link below to see true compatibility:
[...]

As you can see, for the Wii version of this game, no Guitar Hero guitars or drums work, despite the description above telling you otherwise.  Also notice how for a Rock Band game, the peripherals that came with Rock Band 3 don't even work with these games!

Again, keep in mind: If you do not have the Rock Band guitars or drums for Wii, you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE THIS GAME!

And now, I will prepare to ship this back to Amazon! Game Description is a Farce!"
1.0	"Disappointed. I have a bunch of games that I run through Steam without requiring any additional bloat. I get this game, install through Steam, hit play and a UPlay login screen comes up requiring me to register to play the game - and presumably, I have to be online to play.  Not only that, it launches in a window that takes up the full screen (has a window border around it). Tried launching a few time and I get the same screen.

Total bummer, I'm not that excited to play anymore. I guess I get to look forward to some new junk-mail popping up in my inbox... Beware - Steam activated, but requires UPlay to run in the background"
1.0	"Overall, horrid sound quality make great design and a cool concept worthless. Although I can hear others crystal clear, friends say it sounds like I swallowed the mic instead of having it around my neck. One commented that it sounds like I'm being mauled by a bear. The only time it sounded crystal clear to them was when I was standing up to grab my wireless headset. Believe it or not, I don't feel like standing up every time I want to use this. It appears to boil down to either bad wiring or a bad connection. If you're still willing to try your luck and would like to know more about the design then read on.

One of the primary issues with the MW3 version of the same mic seemed to be the ""one size fits all"" that didn't fit all. This version is expandable. Each side has 4 settings for a total of 8 possible sizes. Each setting seems to expand it about an eighth of an inch for a total of (go math skills!) an inch of customization to play with.

A sturdy, adhesive backed, foam rubber strip is included to go along the inside of the back of the collar. Does this make much of a difference? I don't think so. If there were more weight to it and if it rested on your neck rather than wrapping around it, maybe it would.

The connection going into the controller is looser than it should be. I'm using it with the new GoW3 controller so it's not like it's an old controller that has worn from excessive use. It has fallen out without me noticing once. It also crackles here and there when moved. The wiring and connection design seem to be flawed.

Lastly, there is ample length to the wires, but wireless would have been much preferred. Unfortunately, Microsoft won't allow third party developers to create wireless peripherals. Without getting into my personal politics on this policy, I'll just say that you can't fault Madcatz for this shortcoming.

In the end, it looks like I'll be attempting to return this item for a refund. Cool concept, waste of money."
1.0	I bought it just before my computer crashed. Never got a chance to use it. When I got my new computer it had windows 8. This program is not compatible. Not happy. Not windows 8 compatible
1.0	not a good game at all feel bad for purchasing
1.0	"This game is the SAME exact game, graphics, cars, drivers, and tracks as last years game. they might as well call is ""nascar 2005 continued""

I remember when i bought nascar 2003, and when i bought 2004 the next year there was a HUGE difference in driving,tracks,career mode, and A LOT more :)

but from '05 to '06, it leaves me to believe that EA sports will be out of buisness in the matter of SECONDS. im sorry, im just being honest. im just gonna say it.. DONT waste your money.."
1.0	This game requires a anti piracy download known as securom it's been known to disable cd burners slow your pc and even disable it purchase at your own risk. warning securom malware download required
1.0	Worked for around 7 days then wouldnt hold a charge. One Star
1.0	"NOT WORTH IT!

Its a total hack/rush job.  I've had the game crash on me 3-4 times now.  Whoever worked on this should be ashamed and both what they put together and the ridiculous price tag.

Besides the crashing, the graphics are atrocious!  I understand this is the last gen version, but its ludicrous....

Just upgrade and put your money towards a PS4.  If you can't upgrade yet, wait till the price drops at least $20-30 cause its not worthy of that price tag at all.  What a way to give the finger to us Ps3/360 players.  Total BS! A crappy port to last gen...buyer BEWARE!"
1.0	This is not a good game. The graphics are poor. You are constantly fighting the camera. Controls are annoying. Has frame rate problems at times. And it's simply boring. if you haven't played a Tomb Riader game before, DON'T START
1.0	I bought this to go with XIM4 system for Xbox One.  It exposed several problems with this mouse.  I had no problem programming settings on my Logitech mice, including the really old MX518.  However, with this mouse, all the combo keys do not work.  For example, CTRL+, SHIFT+, ALT+ any of the keys do not work simultaneously like the Logitech ones, therefore they do not work properly.  Also, all the combo key (hold c for .9 seconds, etc) did not work.  Oddly, on my PC with the driver, those combos all work.  I tried back and forth several times, and finally figured it out.  The key combos only work when you have the software running.  The mouse do not retrain the settings like most of the new mice do.  I really liked the look and ergonomics of Redragon mice, but they just do not work properly without the software running.  If you are looking for a gaming mouse for XIM4, this is not the mouse for you. Key combos do not work properly
1.0	Better kinda game for kids. One Star
1.0	Becuase i'm getting high ping on servers. EA is making the game bad by seperate all people to go on a EA server and then to respawn data center server. EA is making the game bad by seperate all people to go on a EA server and then to respawn data center server.
1.0	This game is just a bit too animated for me.  While you are looking for hidden items there are flashing stars that are very distracting.  Would not recommend.  There are much better hidden object games out there.  Like 100% Hidden Objects. Not fun
1.0	Activision have created another Call of Duty game, adding more needless and useless features, further burying the video game saga in the muck and mire of overcomplication. The bugs and issues with this game seem to be the only constant aside from the massive amount of cheaters in online gaming networks. If you want to spend hours in frustration, pondering why you wasted your money, then this is the perfect game for you. Activision's customer support for this franchise is nonexistent, since they already have your money. Don't waste your time on this game, when its predecessors (any of them) are a much better choice. Call of Doody
1.0	"Well I bought the fishing bundle (game and pole controller) for the XBOX 360 pretty much without first viewing any trailers or images for the game... still hoping this would be graphically as good as other Rapala games, and maybe as well a made product as Bass Pro Shops The Strike.  I have ""played"" the game for 2 hours... caught 1 fish... and still haven't figured out how to cast nor how to maneuver the rod to attract fish to the lure.  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!  The graphics while you are driving around the lake are pretty good... but the underwater graphics are never really very clear, nor do they vary very much... I guess you're supposed to feel like you're actually seeing the fish through the water.  Using the tutorial does nothing except make you more and more frustrated as you try to change tactics and realize that nothing works. The fish I have seen swimming around look pretty good, but I've only caught a pike thusfar.  I know it's a game with a lot of glitches, but the 2009 Rapala Fishing Frenzy is in many ways far superior to this poor attempt at a fishing game.  Rent it first... plan on spending A LOT of time learning the ins and outs of the game... and I hope you fare better.  If you haven't played Pro Bass Shop's THE STRIKE, you may seriously want to give that a shot over this shoddy attempt of making a ""fun"" family fishing game.  Bring on THE STRIKE 2! That's what I'm waiting for...

P.S. if you buy this game DON'T purchase it with the rod peripheral for $30.00 extra.  After checking Activision's website, many players are very dissatisfied with this product.  There is NO vibration, the reel handle doesn't work the way it's supposed to.  I played the game with just the regular XBOX controller, and while it's still a dull game, things did work a tad better. In the mean time, I have caught more fish, but every one comes to the boat the same way... there's no variation.  BORING!!! I still stand by my original rating. This is supposed to be fun?"
1.0	This version of doom sucks, is missing half the levels and the sound is garbage.  32x huh? Garbage!  SNES version was even better than this! Worst version of DOOM ever.
1.0	The left ear stopped working after a week (no sound) I was careful with it too. Meh
1.0	"I purchased this item because it is pink, which is my new favorite color, but I was sadly disappointed to discover that no matter how hard I tried and how much ""mustard"" I put behind my best efforts to push the remote in this wheel, it just doesn't fit!!!

Not a happy camper! Not really the best purchase I have made"
1.0	"This is the worst piece of crap Nintendo has put out in decades. The range is less than 10 feet for the wireless controllers. They insist on forcing you to use the old wii-motes for games, and you can only pair 1 tablet to each wiiu. They shot themselves in the foot there. Besides, our tablet just tells us it cannot connect to the base, and NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT. We are being told to just buy a new tablet, and if that doesn't work to buy a new wiiu. WHAT???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Our friends lost hundreds, if not thousands of hours of saved data on the infinity game. That is a trap by the way. It will cost you THOUSANDS of dollars to get all the figurines needed to play as the characters. IF YOU LOSE THE FIGURINE YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO PLAY AS THAT CHARACTER!!!!!

Who do these a-holes think they are anyway? Piece of crap, don't buy."
1.0	It is what it is, but the price to storage ratio on these suckers is atrocious... One Star
1.0	"The drums didn't work out of the box.  We couldn't get through to support for two days, then they were rude, then we got someone else who said we could do an express return (they send new drums by FexEx 2nd Day before you even have to send back the defective ones) but it has been much longer than that now and there isn't even a tracking number yet on the web site where one can use one's RMA to see the status of the return.  Who knows if and when we'll get what we paid for?  It turns out many people are having problems like this.  The company shipped garbage so it could make money at Christmas, instead of shipping products that work.

And don't get me started on having to buy additional Wii controllers, and probably chargers as well.

The kids love the game.  We parents don't like to see the family getting taken by the manufacturer. It Would Be Nice If It Worked"
1.0	"I was SO excited to get this game. I was ready to spend months on it, to have a really awesome experience, Reviews were excellent and many of my friends love the Dragon Age Series, but WOW.

This was the dullest game I've played in a very long time. And I'm usually very stubborn, I will try my hardest to enjoy a game. Maybe this is an installment in the series that's sweeter after playing 2?

The strongest thing this game had going was its characters and character dialogue. In fact it was the only thing that drove me to pick up the controller at all. The battle system was a limp bore and I wasn't drawn into the story at all. The world looked to me like some bad mix of Fable and Oblivion and wow I was just very disappointed.

I might get desperate and come back to try and change my own mind after playing the later installments. Just Wow"
1.0	I got this as a backup battery, so when my AA pack dies I can keep playing. However, the plug just will NOT stay in the controller! It keeps just barely sliding out, and not keeping the controller charged. The battery itself too has a short life, definitely not as long as my rechargeable AA batteries. Overall this was a waste of money, save yours, don't by this. Piece of crap, avoid!
1.0	"There are several things wrong with this game
Squad AI and enemy AI: This basically kills the game. The squad AI is so bad, the squad is a liability rather than an asset. Squad members will run out in front of you and block your shot, refuse to stay put when you tell them too, refuse to maintain distance and will therefore attract splash damage to you because they run up next to you, stand out in the open and just shoot away. The way the controls are set up, squad-mates are unnecessarily hard to issue orders to. For example, the game forces you to use a 'Biotic' power to destroy certain enemies. If you're a soldier you don't have access to these powers, so you have to use a squad-mate. To do so, you must have line of sight to the enemy that you want your squad-mate to destroy. WHY? How does this make any sense whatsoever? Why not just let the player switch control between characters like most RPGs of the 'recruit your squad-mates' variety do? Enemy AI is very primitive. While they us cover, it's very sparingly and they never do anything other than hold position or duck and weave between different cover. No grenade usage, no assault, nothing. BORING!
Sticky walls: ME1 decided to go with the '3rd person shooter duck and lean' system popularized by Gears of War. While it may work well on a console, here it's just annoying - you repeatedly stick to any bit of wall that you run into and un-sticking yourself is not smooth but you sort of have to pull yourself away. It's very annoying.
The Car & Mineral Collection: It's no fun to drive (in fact, it drives terribly and is very very aggravating) and they turn resource collection into a boring drive across empty terrain. If you don't do this, you can't buy the good stuff. So you just have to explore scores of worlds, driving across maps to find minerals. It's all very irritating and boring after the first time. The fact that this has to be done many many times made me decide to drop the game and stop playing it.
The BIOWARE recipe: Here's how it works - reveal a terrible calamity to the player. Have him move around the world collecting companions and harvesting resources by giving him boring, semi generic missions (the missions are basically identical between games. Try playing Dragon Age & KOTOR 1 alongside ME1 and you'll see what I mean). When he becomes Uber Powerful, lock him into a channeled sequence of events which culminates in him killing the boss in a (usually boring and repetitive shoot out so many body parts type) boss fight. We went there and did that with KOTOR 1 & 2, Dragon Age 1 & 2 and I hope by now people realize just how absolutely standardized all Bioware games are and how ME 1 stays true to this generic pattern.

In the end, my suggestion is to pass this game over in favor of more interesting titles. Poorly implemented AI & bad game mechanics"
1.0	"Pros: None.

Cons:

1. Only 6 classes and all of them are boring accept The Wizard

2. Horrible PVP

3. Not first person like Call of Duty for an example

4. every map look depressing and hell like

5. Quests are boring

6.  Way to easy to level up

7. Cheaper on last gen

8. Combat works great except that it is boring,

9. The Crusader class is generic of  a Paladin from Maplestory

10. Lag Not Good"
1.0	"This is a money grab by Activition on little kids and turtle fans. The game is poor quality and unfinished. I'll give a breakdown starting with the worst feature of this game.
Audio: The worst of this game in poor audio. The voice work sound as if they called it in and was yelling at the phone. On top of that the music is so faint that when you lower the volume on your tv to make the voice work from screaming it disappears. Also there is no sound effects so when you kid something there is no punch or contact sound.
Graphics: the easiest way to articulate the graphics is they look as original Xbox at best.
Gameplay: all four of the turtles play alike. Pick any cause even though they have different weapons they play the same. There are upgrades but they are not apparent as you play. Just does no feel as you upgraded your turtle.
Replay ability: I retuned my 5 year old sons copy the same day. We did finish and it took about 2 hrs. He has not asked to play it again. This is so bad! One star is one to many."
1.0	"Hi I've had this game for 3 days now and haven't been able to play it since it crashes on startup. I have Total War Shogun 2. It played fine until I installed the Fall of the Samurai. Fall of the Samurai is DLC attachment to Shogun 2. As soon as I installed it Shogun stopped working. Still trying to fix it. Fun fun!!

Update 5/18/2012
I've had this game for a month now. Tried everything on the total war forums to fix it, complained to sega. I have not been able to play the game at all! This is the only game I own that doesn't work. I buy new games every month, what a waste this one is. Typical bug filled release"
1.0	"With the rise of free private WOW servers, there is really no point in buying a monthly subscription. There are literally dozens of them (google ""private wow servers""), which modify game play in a variety of ways to suit what you prefer, and some servers like truewow seeking to replicate the original experience as close as possible. Really no point in paying"
1.0	I read some reviews. I got it because of a couple reviews about story line... I'm all about the story line, BUT I was fed up just after playing the first level. It seemed very amateur. The first level is just a maze going up in one direction moving horizontally, but going up. The sound effects were just very OLD. The sound effects were as great/bad as Street Fighter in the 90's -- plain, and dull, and boring, and not current with the times. I'll give this game away, if someone will take it. Story line? Not. Sound effects OLD like 90's Street Fighter (Ewww). Amateur for game design.
1.0	As you'll probably know, civilization continues and here's the newest version of the game known as civ3. Now don't get too excited about this game, as more often, you never know how it will end up as. I know, i know, it's enjoyable but just like civ1 and 2 were, i don't really think civ3 will make any difference. Gameplay and graphics changed a little bit from civilization 1 to 2. But overall, everything is the same. Whoever made this game is a person who likes to cheat people into buying this game and wasting their money on some garbage. I'd suggest buyers think more often about the sims and simcity 3000 and if they have these games, they should be thankful to themselves. Thank you. Civilization3, a game?
1.0	.How can this be a 5 star game. No way! It's stupid!! I've had it for 2 days and i'm already getting bored of it. The movies are ok, but the game play is boring, and most of the jokes are really corny. Spend your money on a different game, seriously. No way!
1.0	I can't think of the last game I've played that I hated this much. Maybe I've just spent too much time failing driving missions because the steering is so freaking awful. And then there's the realization that ONCE AGAIN, I'm playing yet another version of the EXACT SAME game as Assassins Creed, and Far Cry with different scenery. I'm sorry, but I'm not about to unlock another tower so that i can unlock another portion of the map, If i'd had wanted to do that I'd have just waited for the next assassins creed to come out. Don't buy this if you expect something new out of Ubisoft
1.0	"It is a spelling game where they flash the words to you before you type them, and the words are never read out load to the player.  Then they make everything timed, so there is pressure to go fast.  For someone who is learning a new word and learning to spell it, actually hearing the word is pretty critical.  This is what spelling is about...you hear the word and then write it down, but in this case the developers took a few short cuts.  My 7 year old son reads at a very high level, but I wanted him to recognize words he hears, so this game really falls for me.

Graphics are pretty weak, games aren't horrible, but nothing to write home about.  Overall, I think it might be good for someone with a good vocabulary trying to refine their spelling and just have fun playing a game, but I bought this as a educational game for my kids.  It might be fun, but I don't see much or any educational value in this game. It's a spelling game which doesn't speak the words....."
1.0	This game is way too difficult and complex. No way to reduce the difficulty level, either. Would not recommend for people who aren't expert gamers. Way too difficult
1.0	DooM! Click and collect! DooM! Click and collect!
1.0	Didn't work on normal wood desk surface. This mouse absolutely requires a mouse pad. No thanks. One Star
1.0	Nonsense of a story and I don't like to be badgered by a npc!  Just wanted to drive and see the countryside.  Don't play this one very much. Didn't like it at all
1.0	Dump story. Worthless...
1.0	After marathon rounds of COD: MW3, I noticed my PS3 slim was a smidge on the toasty side. I wound up buying this in hopes that it would keep the unit cool. Initially, it worked great. It was pretty quiet and you could definitely notice hot air being pulled out of the unit. BUT, after about 3-4 weeks, the fans started going out and every time I turned my PS3 on, there would be a loud whirring/grinding noise coming from the fans. After about 15 minutes or so it would stop but it was a freakin pain to have to listen to the fans grinding to their inevitable doom. I contacted Nyko and they were kind enough to send me out a replacement for the unit. Great right? No. The second unit had the same issues and started crapping out after a couple weeks. Contacted Nyko again, they sent me out another replacement unit. AGAIN, after about 2-3 weeks, the fans started going out and continued making loud grinding noises whenever I booted up the PS3. At this point, I'm completely dissatisfied with this product. Clearly Nyko is, or should be by now, aware of this issue however they've done nothing to correct it and continue selling these defective units to unsuspecting customers. I've had a total of four of these units and every single one of them were defective/flawed to the point where I couldn't even use them. While the price may be attractive, as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. If you're in the market for some cooling device for your PS3, look elsewhere and find something with better quality than this thing. Product is pure garbage. Don't waste your money.
1.0	"O.K.  I will keep it short and sweet.  I thought the idea of brushing up on my opponents psychological profiles and reading dossiers to plan my missions would be fun.......but in reality, none of this mattered at all in the game.  Here are the problems with the game so you don't have to read a long review.  I am only sharing MY opinion and it may not reflect your own, however, it is difficult to imagine a reasonable person would not find the following issues a bit troubling.

1.  Terrible AI always knows where you are.  You can hide behind walls, use stealth and plan your route.  All to no avail.  They will find you without even seeing you.  The cover system is also broken, with constant problems.

2.  Broken battle mechanics.  You're telling me I spent all this time learning of my foes and hacking computers and alarms to need to shoot a hypersensitive  guard who can run 50 mph IN THE HEAD FOUR TIMES before he is eliminated?  When did they invent bullet proof heads?

3.  The hacking and alarm overrides in the game could be fun, if they were not so hard to complete within a reasonable amount of time.  I have nothing against difficulty, it makes a game challenging.  However in this case, they took it a little too far. Be reasonable.

4.  All of the reading and planning missions, even weapon selection have absolutely no bearing on the game as the developer would lead you to believe.

5.  Most of you are going to want the few hours of time you gave to this game back.  They should pay you to play this game. Seriously?"
1.0	Horrible.. one of the worst cods ever created..i don't know where to begin...hit detection that is completely off.. lag compensation.. horrible spawns... horrible maps...horrible boring kill streaks...glitches everywhere... auto aim not working in certain areas... people see you on there screen before you see them... ridiculous endless thursting in air never have to touch the ground... and MWR is ok also a glitch mess.. COD is dead by there own hands Horrible.. one of the worst cods ever created
1.0	Sim City was an excellent franchise prior to the release of this game. Open world, freedom to create in an interesting sandbox, and so on. But with the introduction of Origin and required online play, the game fails. No longer is the game about enjoying creating, it is a competition to build the biggest city. And the system works poorly. I am very disappointed in this new offering, and the excessive Digital Rights Management in order to get the game going is a major nuisance to jump through. Even if this game were the greatest game ever, it would not be worth the hurdles brought on by Origin. One word: Origin
1.0	are you serious? this thing is one of the biggest pieces of trash ive ever played. so far it is absurdly boring, quiet, and pointless. my first let down was that you couldn't really hit anyone or anything, unless it was shining. even though it looks pretty with the blood and all, the fighting is just really boring in this game. too much running around and just... wow there is nothing good about this game. seriously, why was this made? wow, just terrible.
1.0	Stay FAR AWAY!  Read comment section below... Dr. Mario 64
1.0	almost zero single player,,you can not save or buy or anything without being on line game is not grand tourismo,it is 95% on line racing ,,, even licensing needs an on line connection, PD flat out lied by leaving out something called the truth,, PD News very well but if they told everyone this was an online only game they would've went through the same thing Microsoft went through when they tried this crap HORRIBLE ALWAYS ON LINE GAME PERIOD
1.0	"Wow, stunningly tepid graphics. Unreal in 1998 had better graphics. Gameplay is just stupid. No AI to speak of and
the so called puzzles are too simple. Story line and action is one cliche after another. And what is it with EVERY door having the stupid security panel that you have to short circuit by holding E for 6 seconds. Does this add somthing to the game? The level design must have been done by students, blind students. I can't even finish the game because of a bug that causes you to fall through the elevator. (Lots of complaints about this bug). Gamecock doesn't even acknowledge the error. Don't waste your money, it's worth 4 bucks tops and that with a fix for the bug. Still no bug fix as of today. Legendary lameness on the PC"
1.0	To easy to score goals and it is not better than Pro Evolution Soccer, FIFA is no longer challenging try PES and it will open the doors to the real footballing experience. Went from FIFA to PES
1.0	"I'm a sid meiers junkie and have played pretty much all of his games since Civ1 and was in love with all of them up to this game at which point I'm just now disappointed with what his studious put out.

The game play itself is really great and the graphics are awesome. It's too bad that after 30-50 turns the game becomes unplayable due to performance and you'll never get to actually finish a game that you start.

People will argue that Steam isn't DRM but that's exactly what it is. I have the game on CD with the expansion. I can't install them though because steam doesn't work right. The game won't install while Steam is offline, so why do I have a disc? I don't know. When I go online, steam won't connect because either their servers are down or windows firewall blocks something (although I doubt that since I turned it off, but that's what steam says). People who pirated the game are playing it right now, probably reading this post and laughing because their copies just work and they didn't pay $50 for the first DVD and $50 for the expansion like I did. Of course the joke is on everyone because the game runs slow even on higher end systems. I have a friend running a PC with 32GB of RAM and two NVIDIA 680's in SLI with a 256GB SSD and even on that beast of a machine the game crawls to a screaching halt of performance after about 40 turns. The farm graphics disappear completely from the screen so knowing what is built on a tile requires you to hit F10 to see what's actually there or to hover the mouse over each tile until you find something that you haven't built on.

Summary: Good game made bad by Steam DRM and poor coding.

What I would like to see Firaxis explain: How much did firaxis pay for this to win game of the year and did the people who gave the award get to actually play a complete game all the way through on a huge map with multiple city states and civ's? If so, what was their trick to actually getting the game to work the way that it should? Horribly Disappointing game in this franchise riddled with DRM, DLC, and flawed graphics rendering"
1.0	I did not want the sims three to turn in to some video game like the ps3 or xbox. If I wanted to chat with friends I will go on facebook and do that. I like sims 3 because it seems real and showtime is another sad excuse for a expansion even without it you can play instruments for people and sing already. Slowed down my computer so much had to take it off, if this is where sims is going I won't be buying any more expansions. sims 3 is not facebook
1.0	"I will start off by being fair to Capcom: The fighting engine is terrific, and you could tell that from the days of the beta. This great fighting engine, however, is locked away in a mess of a product that will, at the time of the this review, thwart almost all attempts to find enjoyment with it. It is severely lacking in single player content, and yet its online modes do not work consistently. It is an example of the haste and greed that are becoming all too prevalent in today's gaming culture, and stands out as one of the few games where hype can turn to boredom in one play session (especially if you can't get online).....

Beyond that, I think what needs to be highlighted is the financial interest that Capcom has in not providing a satisfying single player experience on day one (or, perhaps, at all). By making all DLC free to unlock if you have the time, Capcom has created a baked-in a free-to-play economy into their $60 release. If players could have a satisfying offline experience and earn FM, even at a reduced level, theyd have less incentive to go online to do it. Now, when you play online, you often come up against players who are beyond your skill level, so grinding will become an exercise in frustration for many, leading the casuals to simply pay for the content that they do not have the time, patience or skill to unlock. I have called this elsewhere the parasitism of the free-to-play business model: Games will demand increasing amounts of either your time or your money to stay current and competitive . Since, for all of us, one or both of these resources is limited, devs know that they can count on us to cave in...if the game is good enough. And, in the case of SFV, the game really is good enough. Hearthstone is the same way: It is a brilliantly executed idea marred by an exploitative (and profitable) business model. In previous years, being a gamer meant paying a certain amount of money in exchange for a series of digital pleasures towards which you could devote your time in amounts that you freely determined. In the new gaming economy, developers withhold pleasure by monetizing your time in the hopes of forcing you into a kind of opportunity cost analysis. Do you really have the time to devote to unlocking this mode or character, in light of all of your other responsibilities? No? Then pay up. A great fighting engine ruined by haste and greed."
1.0	got this on ps+ free.  the game is so terrible.  the guns are uninspiring.  shooting with it boring too.  the gun handling just does not feel like handling a gun.  ads is slow and glitchy.  visually, graphics does not look good at all.  and frame rate does not feel good too.  at this point, i am just forcing myself to play.  oh man, it is so terrible the game is so terrible. the guns are uninspiring

1.0	"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, show Ubi your middle finger as long as they support Sony's illegal SecuROM!

Since game publishers now can do whatever illegal action they see fit without any problem from authorities, WITHOUT TELLING YOU BEFOREHAND, it is it imperative for you to do your homework and this game comes infected with the following illegal scheme:

3rd-party DRM: SecuROM'
5 machine activation limit

You've been warned - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Any changes in your machine - it could be as little as an OS patch - could trigger this illegal spyware to nuke your activation and you have only 5 activations...
You want to sell the game when you're done? Sorry, it ain't work, pal because activation limit prevents it - another sheer violation of your rights (see First-Sale Doctrine in the US), rendering it essentially a rental copy.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, let's send publishers a message: you say DRM - we say NO. ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER ILLEGAL DRM-INFECTED, LIMITED ""RENTAL"" RELEASE, this time from UbiSoft - ANOTHER CANCELLED ORDER"

1.0	"Honesly, this whole kit is not worth it.  I can buy the fact that some people want good things like this, but seriously, evyerthing you get here is just cheaply made, and the case is also really stupid.  The case dosen't really have many compartments for alot of things, especially if you are wanting to use your own stuff.  What really bugs me is the products they gave us

UMD case-the thing only fits 3 games, and if you are planning to go on a long trick, you certainly won't entertain yourself with only 3 discs.  Got to have a variety, and it won't be any fun to just be playing 3 games either.  The case itself blows as well.

neck strap-this makes the PSP really awkard around your neck, unless you want to be a poser rapper (if you do that, I will laugh AT you). worthless.

headphones-good god, these are the worst headphones ever.  THey don't go loud, and you'll drain the battery because the input of the sound levels drain the battery, but the output will bog down the sound that was already produced.  The gimmicky slider in the middle is the only good thing, but i'll take exellect sound over some stupid slider anyday,

the screen protector-the exact same thing that came in the starter kit, it leaves a stick resedue.  Simple unnacceptable.

the car charger-the only thing worth a _____, but it's a poor, cheap plastic thing, there are better car chargers out there.

the cloth-the only good thing in this waste of plastic, but the PSP cloth is better, and you can find above average cloths packed in with decent sceen protectors for a better value.

And honestly, the case ain't worth it either.  it sounds like a good idea, but it's the complete opposite.  Save your money, there are better products for a better value out there. Intec fails again"
1.0	"If I had to sum up this game in one word, it would be BUGGY. I have several Kinect games, and not one of them have this much trouble reading my movements. It is almost pure luck to get the game to read any of your movements.

  This game is a perfect example of a company rushing out to capitalize on a new technology, without putting any effort into their product. I would recommend buying this game for someone only if you enjoy watching them yell at their screen and throwing up their hands in frustration. One of the worst games I have ever played in my entire life! Stay Away"
1.0	This game, when I first fot it, was the best. But now when I think over the plot, it is very stupid and immature. Goldeneye (the main character) turns evil because MI6 won't accept him as an agent. You can wield two guns at the same time, which is kind of cool, but what is he, some mutant evil cowboy. After you use up all your weapons you have to use and extremely weak pistol with unlimited ammo. And after under cover for 2 seconds your health goes back up! The multiplayer is extremely boring and confusing. And the game has an extremely weak plot that revolves around Goldeneye turning against Goldfinger and Oddjob. This game is extremely stupid. DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!! Very Childish
1.0	"Sound selection is limited.
I can sit down and score almost perfect.
My lamp gets recognized more often then i do. I can sit down and score almost perfect. My lamp gets recognized more often then i ..."
1.0	Oh! come on this game isn't that easy. It is so hard. This game has too many confusing puzzels. If you looking for something Really fun try something a little easier. Oh Yeah!
1.0	"Limited activations is basically the buzzkill for this game, although Starforce alone is enough to warrant staying far away from DCS Black Shark. Looks like another promising title has been ruined by an idiotic and vain attempt at preventing resale and/or piracy. There are already many cracks and work-arounds out on torrent sites. Why punish the paying customers with these stupid DRM schemes?

I don't mind a simple disc check, but installing crap like Starforce drivers on my system has already caused me pain in the past. I never used to care about DRM, I would just happily buy the games and play them. Now I have to do a damned investigation before purchasing anything! Limited Activations, Starforce DRM"
1.0	Capcom doesn't seem to realize that people play video games for entertainment, not torture. The first boss battle is so hard I just took out the disk and threw it into the trash bin. This is not my idea of fun! Don't waste your money on this crap. All you do is run around looking for things to help you move on. You get pathetic weapons with very limited ammo, then you fight enemies that are very hard to kill (you unload almost your entire clip just to kill one lousy zombie). RE3 is alot better than this one - at least Jill knows how to dodge. If you still wanna try this game, don't pay more than 5 bucks! horrible game
1.0	"I've never written a really bad review like this.  There is always something worthwhile with these games.  This one though is astonishing.  It simply DOES NOT RUN...  ever.  I envy those who have played through to tell the tale.  But I have never had such a miserable install, so many bugs and patches that simply did not work.

EA should be embarrassed.  The error messages are simply too bizarre for words.  This is 2007 for goodness sake.  No one releases code this nasty anymore.  The patching mechanism simply does not work.  You are FORCED to create an account, otherwise you cannot have access to support (but I already paid the $50).

You cannot download the patches, you have to use EAs miserable updater, which does not work, ever, on any computer.  I was shocked at the amount of code/software quality issues I see on the Hellgate forums.  I have NEVER seen anything like it before.  It seems like a large percentage of people simply cannot get the blasted software to work.

Enough said.  I never write reviews/commentary like this.  I leave that to the naive 14 year olds who don't know how the world works.  But this time, I am seething with anger over this total waste of money and time. I've never been this amazed and disappointed"
1.0	"I am a professional computer technician and have worked inside PCs for 20 years. I found the install to be easy and painless but the net result is disappointing. After installing the fan I pulled my sound meter out and checked the decibels being emitted. They were indeed down significantly and the fans light looked great!

Then I closed the case and put the Xbox back together. It was grinding... Ahhhh!!!  So I disassembled again and looked for wires that may be hitting the fans... I didn't really find anything but I tried to clear what I could and reassembled the unit. Again, during test while Xbox was open it was fine but when I enclosed it again it started to grind. I squeezed the back of the unit and it stopped. Weird but OK.

Then I ran under load - while watching Netflix or gaming. The sound is 2 decibels higher than the stock cooler. Worse, my Xbox experienced a RED RING OF DEATH while playing Kinect Adventures. This leads me to believe it's not ""58% more"" efficient. I don't think it's moving air as well as the stock cooler was and now I've opened my Xbox 3 times (twice during install and once for removal) for nothing. Bummer!

The red light is cool. That is all I can say positively. Easy to install but not quiet and NOT COOLER!!!"
1.0	"Here is my checklist of features that games need to be playable:
- Pause. I am an adult. I have to fix my own food, get clean, shop, answer the phone. Adult stuff. Phone rings I can't whine, ""Mom, get the phone."" I am old and need to eat right, make meals, exercise, go to the dentist, use the bathroom etc, and sometimes NOW, not later. No pause, no play. This game has no pause.
- Fair respawn amount. You get tossed back to your ship after some few minutes of inactivity. You must rekill everything you just did before the phone rang. Some respawns are 10-20 minutes of refighting the same battle.
- Side missions to help you level up in case you are having a hard time with some enemy or other. In Destiny, you can redo old missions or go to an arena where Bill Nighy drones on about retaking area A or B.
Without a pause, no game is playable for me.
Sorry this didn't review the game. The mechanics were too bad to get beyond these points.
Borderlands, InFamous, Prototype have these things. The mechanics were too bad to get beyond these points"
1.0	"This game is a beast to install. First, you install the game. Then Microsoft VC++ redist, then Microsoft .NET FX redist. Then DirectX. Then a bunch of texture packs (all of which are separate installs). Then, you have to not only activate, but register, using your real email address. Then it forces you to update, which is a 1.2GB download.

If I ever get through this installation hell, I'll update my review. But as of right now, I've been installing it for about two hours and I'm still not done.

Edit #1: I finally got the installation to complete, but I can't find the serial key. I contacted customer support and they said it was on the back of the manual, but my manual is completely blank on the back!! I emailed them a photo of the manual and the game box and hopefully they'll be able to get me a new key, but this really sucks. If I ever get to play this game, I'll come back and update this review again. It might be fun, if I ever get it to install"
1.0	It was fine if not a little bland but i was still enjoying it.  Now i have tried playing it a couple times and i feel like a pebble blocks my path, not to mention any quest that has you going to the top of the hill you can forget about it.  Feels like the recent updates have regressed the game back to alpha status and glitches everywhere. In short just unplayable now
1.0	Game freezes over and over its unplayable it just doesn't work
1.0	Incredibly crackly sounding.. people say I sound fine but I hear so much crackling sound on my end. Also its really weird about connecting sometimes so I have to delete it and repair it... wouldn't recommend Mine doesn't sound right at all.

1.0	"Almost every night, I sit here and wonder why we have so many video games in the world.  What makes this game even worse is the fact that it really wants to be a Mario Kart game.  We already have Mario Kart, so this game is pointless.

This game continues to get worse the more I play it.  Good luck trying to control your vehicle.  I was never able to do that.  I kept crashing and wouldn't be able to win any of the races.  I really want you to avoid this game. go away"
1.0	What a disaster. This game would have been a bad PS2 game years ago. Horrible graphics, even worst gameplay, and a story that makes no sence. You could even tell the publisher knew this game was bad when it debuted at $40. If you want a game that is worth every penny buy Killzone 2. A game that to this date is the best first person shooter ever made. One of the worst shooters ever
1.0	ive played thief dark shadow and loved it so i bought the dark project and metal age mainly because it stated it would run on xp pc. howevr, it gets to the weapons section then just goes to dark screen. will not play or go anyfurther. it Will not go on an Xp comp. i have some things they said to do to get it to run and have to redo it each time i play. to me this is a waste of money and time as i was led to beleave it would run with no special trickery. rather dissapointed and mad. been misled. will not play
1.0	Save your money if you just want the new content. What you are purchasing is Saints Row 4, barely remastered, and a code to download Gat out of Hell. The latter content is nowhere to be found on the disc, and if you've already played SR4 on PS3, this disc is a blatant, and unworthy, cash grab. Gat out of Hell can be purchased online for $20 and I recommend getting it there. This is retarded.
1.0	"Lets get straight to the point here: I absolutely hated this game.

The reason why I called my review Heavenly cannonballs, is because this was the biggest most dissappointing thing for me in the game. I thought there were too many sequences in this game where you had to steer objects with the controller. There is practically as much or more of this horrible gameplay mechanic you have to deal with in the game than there is hacking and slashing, and the game is short enough already!

I am not new when it comes to hack and slash games (they aren't my favorite), but this one was just so completely disappointing. When I got to the last boss, I couldn't take it anymore.. after 11 tries I quit, took the disc out of my ps3, and gave it away to a friend immediately without even beating it. The same friend told me it took him 3 months to beat the final boss on God of War when I complained about the difficulty. Question: How is that even remotely fun? It shouldn't take more than a week to beat a non-rpg single player game in my opinion. Anything beyond that, unless the game is extremely long, is just frustrating and unpleasant. Its like watching a long movie, that takes all the wrong turns when you wish it would take a right one.

I walked out of G.I. Joe because it was a horrible movie. I gave this game away before beating it for the same reason.. HORRIBLE. This game is overrated, and I feel like I completely wasted my time, energy, and money on it. I will not allow this game into my PS3, let alone my home ever again.

Bottomline: There are better games out there for PS3. Skip this one unless you absolutely love Hack & Slash or unlike me, have extreme patience. Should be called ""Heavenly Cannonballs"""
1.0	You literally can not play this game because the developer can not keep the servers up.  The game has NO offline mode which makes the product completely worthless for the time being. Can't Play
1.0	doesn't work One Star
1.0	"i've already purchased 3 :P they are great!

Update: After buying my 4th Razer Deathadder, I am finally going to change to a new mouse. I am sick of having to buy a new mouse every 6-12months. These things work AMAZING when you first get them. Slowly, but surely, the right clickers will wear out and stop working.

Support is absolutely horrendous. Pretty much worthless support at Razer. Been a Razer Product owner for about 15+ years. Finally, going to start switching out my gear. I am SICK of this. DO NOT BUY!!! Works Great At First! BREAKS SUPER QUICK! Right Click, Breaks EASY!"
1.0	Cool game, always online is bs though. No reason single player campaign can't be played offline. Very very annoying! Developers wtf. Always online===annoying crap!
1.0	I really couldn't do it.  You gotta be a fan of this style to really enjoy the game... Just not into the style.
1.0	This game is so terrible. Nintendo loves to milk their games. just all bad
1.0	Absolute garbage One Star
1.0	i hate it very much it doesnt i mean it doesnt want to update on my 360 which is really abummer because i love nba street games bad
1.0	The game I had expected it to be and the actual game it was were two different things. The game was extremely dull, very little to acomplish except explore the galaxy and name planets you find. No human contact ever which really sucks. I feel if they added a friend option to start the game with a friend it would at least give you an added bonus to waste time with somebody rather than feeling like Will Smith in I am Legend. Even then will smith had a dog that could do things and give him company. This game your alone in a boring galaxy with really nothing worth doing.  This should have been a game you play on your phone or tablet, not a console game. It was a huge let down. A let down.
1.0	"When it works - it's great. But when it doesn't - it's infuriating. Simple things, like subscribing to Unlimited may turn into a frustrating ordeal... You pay for the subscription, but the game may not unlock stuff for you - in particular if you use separate ""kids"" profile, and the purchase is made using your own account. UBISOFT support is very slow to respond, and is insultingly unhelpful (e.g. ""Did you unplug your Xbox?""). I've also had server connection issues in the past, when a dance would interrupt in the middle with an error message, frustrating kids over and over. UBISOFT's support response? Yep, check your network.. They always blame the customer for their problems. Your mileage may vary"
1.0	"Can't finish the game because the hint  button doesn't work at one point. I wish they would ""proof"" these games before they release them. Money wasted.
Have tried twice now and game doesn't work. Don't bother. Don't buy it."
1.0	"From watching videos of this game on YouTube,I can tell that ""Shadow Of Mordor"" is absolutely beautiful on next generation consoles. The gameplay looks great and seems very smooth,the graphics are amazing,the nemesis system is interesting and the presentation is overall beautiful. Sadly,the same cannot be said for the last gen version of this game(at least the Xbox 360 version anyway). For starters,the graphics are DREADFUL! HONESTLY! I've seen better looking graphics on original Xbox games from 2003! The textures in this version of ""Mordor"" are downright UGLY! While the combat isn't all that bad,the game often time lags and there are occasional freeze-ups during gameplay and main mission cut scenes. One in particular froze up on me THREE times! I thought for sure,that I was going to have to return this game,but fortunately it finally started working. I couldn't continue on with this review,without also mentioning the annoying loading times. Every single time you exit the options menus,to tweak your options or to upgrade your items,the game loads for about 10 seconds. It's SO agravating! There are also occasional cut aways during certain cut scenes. Clearly ""Shadow Of Mordor"" was meant to be on next generation hardware,and this mess of a port REALLY shows it. The last generation version of ""Mordor"" was even delayed for two months,probably due to hardware restrictions and the programmers trying to FORCE this game on last gen consoles. Overall,this is a great game...just not on Xbox 360 and probably PS3 too. If you want to enjoy ""Shadow Of Mordor"" how it was MEANT TO BE,then buy it for Xbox One or Playstation 4. Terrible!"
1.0	Another poor COD title. Black ops 1 was the last good COD. The series has gone completely down hill since then. The story mode is ultra boring. The multiplayer is crap. The zombie mode is complete garbage here, with cheap 'X' hit markers that pop up everytime you land a shot on a zombie(as if blood spray and wounds aren't hitmarker enough.) It's almost as if the developers of this game made this game suck on purpose. I don't get how anyone could say this is a good game. Very bad
2.0	"I bought this about a year after the original release, and the game still crashes to the desktop, has momentary freeze-ups -- all after a TEN-GIG PATCH DOWNLOAD.

Sure, the graphics are fantastic, the realism of facial expressions noteworthy, the skills and activities more varied than ever. But the usual Fake Difficulty (look it up in TV Tropes) in the controls is still there; at times the 'master assassin' will seem unable to do simple things like enter the window in front of him. The new fight system -- well, Black Flag's was too easy, this one appears to be an attempt to return to the days of Ezio, but some of the mechanics are flawed. Like the 'perfect parry' thing: when the enemy's health bar (usually red) glows yellow, and you hit the block button, Arno makes a parry that leaves the enemy completely open for attack. But watch it -- sometimes the bar doesn't show at all, or the blow is impossible to parry or sometimes it just glows red -- either way, by then you have to dodge instead, but it's already too late. And sometimes you'll swear you hit the 'block' button on time, only to have the enemy run you through and kill you in one blow. Grrrr. I hate fake difficulty, and there's plenty of it here. This might be a good time to say goodbye to the series."
2.0	"I thought this game would be similar to Just Dance. It is a disappointment to say that it's not even close. The graphics are low quality and the only option is 4 players. If you're playing by yourself or have only 2 people playing, it can be difficult to follow the dancers on the screen because there are always 4 dancers, sometimes doing different moves. That is distracting. In some song, the dancers move around and some will go behind others. It's not as easy to follow along with, Just Dance was better. The game also doesn't seem to pick up ques from the Wii remote as well. There were several times when I know I moved and I got X's.

The pro is that the songs are nice. If you're a fan of musicals, you can just put the songs on and skip the dancing. I did that while I exercised on my stair stepper. I hate to say that I spent $30 for a CD that I will rarely dance to.

I rank this game way below Just Dance. I've tried Gold's Dance Workout, and it was a boring aerobics routine with pop tunes in the background. I rank Dance on Broadway slightly above that game. Not worth the money"
2.0	This is another game that leaves much to be desired. The graphics are very PSone like and the gameplay lacks any real substance. You race past cars trying to get near misses and by doing so you fill up your burnout meter. Once your burnout meter is full you can go to supersonic speed whitch doesnt look or feel any different than when you were going normal speed. The near misses get to be very boring after a while. And there are not enough cars or tracks available. The racing to get to the next ckeckpoint is a little to arcade-like. The good thing about this game is that the steering and control are very tight. Bottom line rent it don't buy it. Buy GT3. That's it from me. I'm out :) Review of Burnout
2.0	"I got HM:A Wondeful Life and LOVED it,simply LOVED it!

I played until midnight the day I got it,and kept on playing every day!

I decided to try the GBA HM a spin and I was disapointed with what I got.

Time goes by to quicker than in AWL and the years take too long

The biggest problem is that it gives you no reason to keep going.

In AWL,as the years go by,you get married,have a kid and watch him grow and help influence his career;sure,you can get married and have a kid in this one,but that only means you get to talk to them everyday so they don't hate you.

In AWL,you can do so much with your son,here you just talk to him.

These days,I have stopped playing AWL and FOMT is forgotten.

But I'll always love AWL and hate FOMT Compared to HM:AWL,this game is meh"
2.0	"This was my 4th try on a pair of headphones that claimed they worked for PS4.  They did not and the quality of the headphones are also pretty low.  I was expecting something pretty middle of the road and was disappointed.  They are not very comfy and they just flat out did not work with my PS4.

Probably fantastic for a PS3. Does not work with PS4"
2.0	The Olympics game this year has good sides and extremely annoying, terribly made other games. The field, track, diving, and swimming events are done well, but games, including rowing and volleyball, make me want to break the disk in half. The rowing game has a poorly made course, and 2 times I got stuck in a corner for minutes. In the volleyball, the AI and other aspects are disgustingly crappy. The AI, on multiple occasions, didn't make a movement for the ball when it was coming right to them, and when you are right next to the ball, you will back up and dive. Those parts of the game are incomplete or just shouldn't have been added to the game at all if they weren't logical. Those 2 parts of the game ruined the game for me. I won't look at the next Olympic Games for purchase at all. Sega makes some good games and a ton of bad games, and this is one of the worst. Very Poorly Made
2.0	I pre-ordered this deal and got it last week only to see it get another free game this week. Amazon surely there is something you can do to rectify this misstep to users? Why buy this one when a new deal came out
2.0	While the Assassin's Creed story lines have never been simplistic and sometimes take a while to get into, this one got to be so random I thought there was a glitch. I just couldn't keep up with what was going on. I tried my best, I played 40% of it but it just wasn't keeping my interest. Even though the story and game are interesting, it just didn't translate well into gameplay. They seemed to have taken AC into a new direction only the game makers understand. I just got lost! Confusing!
2.0	Controls and gameplay feel stiff and laggy.  Feels very clunky.  Gave is pretty, but is glitchy.  The opening sequence is so good, but then blah.  Arno could have been a good protagonist, but they never develop him.  Just had a very hard time playing this AC game after playing Blah Flag and Rogue.  Seems like many steps back. Meh
2.0	"To put my review in perspective, I loved the original Far Cry for the PC (not the Xbox-that was a different game altogether.) To date, it is still my favorite FPS, so naturally I did have high expectations for this game named Far Cry 2 and was sadly disappointed.  This game has nothing whatsoever to do with Far Cry.  It is a relentlessly tedious game of driving, shooting guards at guard post (who will re-spawn the second you drive 10 feet past the post), driving, shooting guards at guard post, driving, arriving at location to kill someone, killing some some guards, finding target-killing target, driving, killing guards at guard post, driving, getting new mission--rinse and repeat numerous times!

The weapons are boring, the missions are boring, your character is boring since you are basically nobody, and worst of all, you have malaria and are always looking for some medication.  Honestly, I had to force myself to finish this game.

The good:

Nice graphics for an Xbox game with great scenery from Africa.

Driving is fun for the 10 seconds you aren't near a guard post.

The bad:

No plot to speak of.

Repetitive, tedious game play with endless driving.

Boring weapons--hello, this is a first person shooter!

Repetitive missions.

Shamelessly using the Far Cry name to sell a game that has not the remotest connection to the first game or any similarities whatsoever.

If you can put up with the tedious repetition and don't mind killing the same guards a thousand times and you would like to see some wonderful graphics of scenery from the different parts of Africa--try renting this game if you can.  I wouldn't spend the money on it. Not Far Cry"
2.0	"At first, let me say that if you are expecting this to be like Just Dance, where you actually have to dance/exercise, then you will be disappointed. Do not buy this game if that is what you expect.

This game builds, of course, off the success of Dancing With the Stars: celebrities are present in that you are judged by the actual show judges and get to witness an avatar pair dancing. Gameplay is built around a series of wrist-flicks, no more. Arrows appear on the screen, you flick your wrist with the direction of the arrows, akin, in a way, to Guitar Hero games, of a sort. At least that's what the gameplay reminded me of.

However, the gameplay patterns get repetitive really quickly, and you aren't normally looking just to flick your wrists back and forth when playing the Wii. Not only because it isn't fun, but because, well...it hurts.

If you're looking for a fun dance game, go with the Just Dance series. This game is only for the most hardcore of the fans of the show, as it isn't really fun at all. Repetitive Really Quickly"
2.0	Now I remember renting this game as a kid, boy is it terrible!!  This game isn't worth the $4 I paid for it... the fact that I played it for 5 mins is why I gave it 2 stars rather than one! I messed up....
2.0	It will only record video for a split second if you mess with it long enough and the sound only puts out screeching noises. I'm sure this is just an isolated incident but it is really annoying getting a faulty product... Won't record video or sound...
2.0	"I was looking forward to this game. It installed just fine for me on Windows XP Home SP3. It allows 5 installs. The CD key is not needed during install. Games for Windows Live is not needed to play.

The graphics are okay. The controls are okay, but the controls feel like they came from a console game. The game allows you to customize your character (hair, face, eyes, nose, skin color, etc.). There are lots of skills and inventory (too much, I think). The mission, skills, gadget, and email menu controls are awkward.

The following controls are not listed in the keyboard configuration menu in the game, but they are listed in the game booklet:
Z = skill radial
C = gadget radial
X = weapon radial
Tab = open PDA
P = open PDA - personal dossier
M = open PDA - map/mission select
I = open PDA - loadout
So, if you don't have the game manual, then you wouldn't know that these controls exist. You can't reconfigure these controls to your liking, because they don't exist in the configuration menu in the game.

The game play is not exciting. You are a secret agent, part of a secret government organization, that does secret missions...and other secret things. After the first cut-scene, you wake-up in a secret lab, and you don't know who you are or why you are there. Conspiracies! You are looking for a terrorist who blew-up a passenger plane (the very first cut-scene when the game starts). You are supported by secret agent office staff like Mina...a typical modern day woman with lots of attitude.

Is it an RPG? The box says so. You really can't tell what you're going to say, and your choices are timed. For example, your response choices may be something like ""passive, aggressive, suave, or happy"". Pick one. The problem is that you can't tell what you're going to say based on words like that. Unlike some games, your character actually speaks (instead of you just selecting a response and listening to what the other person says). But your response is timed; you don't have much time to think about each of the word choices based on the conversation. If you don't respond in time (5 seconds or less), then your answer becomes whatever your cursor happens to be highlighting at the time. I don't call that RPG. Also, does it really matter what you say? I got the impression that it doesn't.

The mini-games (like hacking and lock picking--which are essential to completing missions) are not very responsive to keyboard and mouse controls. This is especially true of hacking, which is incredibly awkward and frustrating when using a keyboard and mouse.

I got bored with this game after a short while and stopped playing. For me, the story was boring, not engaging, nothing new. The RPG was poorly executed. The mini-games were annoying. The controls/menu system were clunky. I'm not sure if I'll try to play it again. Honestly, I'd rather re-play other/better games I've played in the past, than try to play this one.

I purchased it new from an amazon seller called ""the General Store"". I paid 2 bucks.

2.0	Ignoring some negative reviews, I bought this knock-off of the Microsoft product. While the audio works fine, the picture on my Dell  E172FP monitor had a yellow overtone with streaking across the bottom of the screen. A week later I went out and bought the $40 Microsoft product and the picture is great. So, as nice as the price tag on this product looked, it simply did not function well for me. The price reflects its quality
2.0	Meh not really for me. Dont like the style of game. Meh not that good.
2.0	"I've seen a few reviews here stating ""I'm not an audiophile but..."", well I am a bit of an audiophile so I thought I'd write a review from my perspective.

First and foremost, I received these as part of a PS4 bundle but still gave them a shot since the reviews here were pretty glowing. The headset gets two stars right off the bat for having a functional microphone and drivers.

From there things get a little ugly though. The audio quality is frankly pretty bad, with muddy lows, weak mids and tinny his. If you've ever tried on any pair of garden variety $20-$40 headphones you know what I mean - a step above airline headphones or iphone earbuds but nothing else. The 7.1 emulation is novel, but again without decent quality of sound it's a bit of a waste. While I don't expect much from $35 headphones they do bill themselves on the box as 'how games were meant to sound'. For the sake of the developers I sorely hope not.

Lastly, the design leaves a lot to be desired. For cheap headphones the headband is actually potentially interesting describing one uninterrupted line, but the driver housing and earpads completely spoil the effect making it look like two different designers worked on each part. The bright blue also looks absolutely bizarre when paired with a human head.

If you're a stickler for sound quality, you've probably already got a perfectly good pair of headphones and would be better off investing the $35 in a decent microphone if you don't have one already. These things are absolutely *not* the way games are meant to sound. Not the way games are meant to sound."
2.0	"Hacking and slashing, along with a bit of strategy, was the name of the game in Phantagram's last projects, the somewhat popular Xbox games Kingdom Under Fire and Kingdom Under Fire: Heroes. The team's latest game, N3: Ninety-Nine Nights, follows a similar structure and familiar gameplay, but it lacks the heart and soul, and anything outstanding, that would put it above other similar games.

 N3 tells the tales of several different characters, none of whom have a very interesting or captivating story. From the blessed, powerful Imperial Knights Inphyy and Aspharr to the brutal mercenary Myifee, you'll encounter characters who have slightly stereotypical roles, appearances, attitudes, and styles. I personally couldn't ever take the game's story seriously simply because of the character names. I already mentioned Aspharr, but you'll also meet Dwikfarrio and Dwingvatt, as well as a giant frog king named Phakk the Third. What were they thinking?

 For days I tried to give N3 a lot of credit for its gameplay, but there isn't a lot that you wouldn't expect from other Dynasty Warriors-esque titles. You'll run straight into hordes of enemies that range in the dozens to the hundreds. These crowds are fun to run into, but once you start attacking, N3 loses its massive charm. The combo attacks for each character are disgustingly simple to pull off and require very little skill in terms of timing. Combos aren't even necessary, in the end, because a player could quite easily mash the basic attack button and finish the game in a few hours. The only challenges I ever encountered were the boss characters, who seemed overpowered and often untouchable.

 Once you kill enough of the horde, you'll accumulate orbs that power up a special attack meter. Each character has two levels of special attacks. The first attack, which is activated after a red orb meter fills up, is interactive: you'll mash buttons and generally watch things die. This series of attacks is simply a beefy combo that you'd normally pull off. The second attack is charged up while killing things in the ""red attack."" You'll earn blue orbs that charge up for a super mega ultimate attack (haha) that kills just about every non-boss character on-screen. Some of these attacks look cool (especially Dwikfarrio's storm of doom), but once you've killed ten thousand orcs, you've killed `em all, right?

 N3 lacks checkpoints or in-game saves, making each and every mission quite punishing. Should you parish 20 minutes into a long mission, you're forced to do it all over again. That's right, you'll kill the same crowd of orcs, destroy the same catapults that are firing at the castle walls, and fend off the same cheap boss character.

 There don't seem to be any rewards for putting yourself through the pain of playing through this game other than unlocking more characters, which simply forces you to play through more of the same [...] you stomached with a previous character. You'll even revisit the same levels multiple times with different characters. Exciting.

 At least N3 looks alright. The staggering amount of enemies on the screen is impressive to say the least, and the minimal slowdown is pretty nice as well. It's too bad the character models get so repetitious, because the heroes that you'll use look amazing. Inphyy, the cover girl, is my personal favorite character, with her glittering golden wings and blood-red and shiny silver armor. It's also too bad that everything in this game sounds awful. The voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard, and the lip sync is so ridiculously off that I began to believe Phantagram didn't even make an attempt at realistic syncing. The sound effects get old within seconds of starting the game up, and the soundtrack didn't seem to kick in enough when it should have.

 N3: Ninety-Nine Nights may very well be the biggest disappointment that the Xbox 360 has had to date. What should have been a gripping, intense action game is nothing more than a game that could have been. Move along, play Dead Rising and enjoy your fall until the winter blockbusters release. I've got 99 problems and this game is one."
2.0	"My wife and I used to absolutely love DDR.  We would play for hours on end into the night.  I had high hopes, and was excited to pick this up on the day it came out.

Pros:

DDR is finally in HD, lots of nice eye Candy
Downloadable Content, if it would work that is.

Cons:

Surprise! Paper pads suck, and there are no decent alternatives.
A lot of the songs really aren't ""dance"" tracks, and only one or two techno songs similar to what made DDR fun in the first place.

For starters, the PS Store errors out when you try to open up the section to buy new songs, but maybe I have to wait until the next PSN Update.

Second, the paper pad really, really blows, but this shouldn't be much of a surprise to anybody who's played DDR before.  So far I haven't seen anybody interested in making better ones, either.  I did have my trusty Red Octane $100 pads stored away in the closet, plugged them in, and low and behold, they worked...sorta.  The left and down arrows work, but up and right are swapped when you press them :'(  I figured they wouldn't have worked, but I can dream...right?

The song selection is kinda meh.  Seemed like they were more interested in getting 'popular' music than music you should be dancing to.  Jason Mraz?  Really?  I'm dancing to Jason Mraz???  Give me back my Afronova and Captain Jack!  To add to that, I haven't figured out yet how to, or if you can unlock songs, or if buying them is the only way.

Overall, a disappointment, but I'll hang on to it a while hoping for some decent replacement pads and at least some good DLC. No good pads, Lost its roots"
2.0	I did not really care for this. Yes it's a little older, but I found the gameplay to be somewhat clunky.  Bought Dead island at the same time and enjoyed that much more. Bought Dead island at the same time and enjoyed that much more
2.0	"I've got a real bone to pick with EA. They just keep giving the Xbox wavw after wave of games with poor graphics and less features than on the PS2. Now, I am real close to dumping EA and begin playing Sega Sports games (which has some very sold games)
PROS: 1. everything Triple Play wasnt
2. some original spots (throw meter, franchise momentum, etc.)
3. commentary is decent
CONS: 1. lightyears behind the other baseball games
2. yet another case of PS2 graphics syndrome
3. Faces look pasted on
4. controls are confusing
5. there is no point to Pitching
6. Franchise mode is all hype
7. cannot control fielding at all
8. impossible to get on base
9. beginning trailer is a real turnoff
FINAL VERDICT: do not waste your time and money on buying this game. If you think I'm wrong, rent it first, then well see whos saying, ""why didn't you tell me this game stunk?"" Another botched EA game on Xbox"
2.0	Talk about an unfinished game, this game could have gone somewhere, but for the 6 months I did, the only end game that I saw was just PVP battles and that depends if that is your taste I am sure the game will come across however if you want to do serious raiding like WoW, or even Star Wars the Old Republic would be better choices.  From what I understood if you want better gear for a character that has to be done by crafting or if you enough gold buy it from the auction house which was put in before October.  To me the game seem unpolished and needs more content.  Now the 1 year mark is coming up in March of 2015 only time can tell what the designers have in mind, but at some point I wouldn't be at all surprised if the game goes free to play that will all depend on the commitment on the game designers.  If you are looking for something that resembles skyrim your best bet is get the game with all of the DLC and do it, from what I am told exploring the game fully will take about a year or more the same time needed to explore Fall Out 3-as much as I can't stand wow atm I would choice it over this simply for the reason it has end game content pending on what the new expansion has installed the only end game that I saw was just PVP battles and that depends if that is your taste I am sure the game will come across how
2.0	"Bullet Witch is bad. Atari and Cavia's third-person action game is so bad, in fact, that I don't even feel like it deserves a flowery introduction. Toss in a terrible game engine, embarrassing graphics, and don't forget to leave out all of the A.I. You're bubbling up a stew of Bullet Witch, kiddies!

Protagonist Alicia is busy running around killing demons after years of horrible events wipe out the vast majority of humankind. She's quiet but she's got a sharp attitude and a hot trigger finger. This is the premise of Bullet Witch, and very little else is explained as the game progresses. Alicia doesn't like demons. She wants to kill them. It's that simple.

Unfortunately, it actually isn't that simple. Alicia, despite being an attractive heroine, controls like a grumpy old man with a crooked walker. She's got some nimble dodge moves mapped to the Xbox 360's L trigger, and these moves let her avoid everything short of exploding cars, falling objects, and snipers that are evidently so sharp that they can nail her mid-jump. In other words, you won't be avoiding much as you hop around wildly and steer your cow-like character around the levels.

You also won't be shooting much; the game's collision detection seems random at best. I would often stand a few paces from an enemy, unloading a machine gun's entire magazine only to watch the enemy mow down Alicia using his machine gun. Lame. The collision detection rears its ugly face anytime the game's ""Walnut Head"" enemies come around. Walnut Heads are floating bodies with huge, pulsating brains-they control magical barriers that Alicia has to break down to continue through the levels, meaning that fighting Walnut Heads is mandatory. Walnut Heads have the power of telekinesis and telepathically throw cars and other huge objects at Alicia, commonly killing her before she's even spotted them.

Alicia can use her broom-like gun (imagine that) to kill enemies, and the player can even change the gun into different forms. By finishing levels, you earn skill points and can upgrade the machine gun into a shotgun, sniper rifle, or gatling gun. Unfortunately, none of the unlockable forms are as efficient as the machine gun. Since there is unlimited ammo, and Alicia doesn't seem to die quickly, there isn't much need to think while shooting. Alicia's spellcasting powers are terribly done; using the bumpers you'll scroll through different types of magic. Some magic, like the ""Ancient Wall"" ability, is completely useless. Ancient Walls completely obstruct your view and break down quickly. Natural set pieces like blown-up cars and corners provide much better cover. Offensive spells like meteor storms and lightning bolts are powerful but use most of your magic points and therefore can't be utilized often enough to be considered helpful. Annoyingly, animations are loaded up as Alicia conjures up her destructive powers that prevent her from avoiding any attacks whatsoever and even freeze her in place for seconds after casting. Even worse, you can't hotkey any of the magic spells to the otherwise unused directional pad-what's the deal with that?

Artificial intelligence is completely missing from this product. In the second level you encounter a few building-sized buffoons with huge machine guns; they're designed to look absolutely monumental and terrifying but are actually gentile giants. Each of them that I encountered in that level actually stopped walking toward me, stopped shooting, and calmly allowed me to shoot their pulsating hearts until they exploded and fell to the ground. I thought the first giant might be a fluke, but indeed the next ones just stopped their terror-inducing rage when they laid eyes on Alicia. The basic grunts are so incredibly stupid that they'll actually walk away from you and into walls after being shot. Still, they've got heart-they're so hell-bent on killing innocent humans that they'll ignore Alicia filling their backside with lead and lightning bolts. I've seen daddy long-legs missing all eight long legs put up more of a struggle than these brainless dolts.

Bullet Witch is among the ugliest of the Xbox 360's library. As I ran through the post-apocalyptic settings I couldn't help but think of Majesco's Xbox sleeper Phantom Dust-but even that bargain Xbox title looked better and ran better than this Xbox 360 one. There are blurry and undetailed textures everywhere, little to no particle effects as a result of shooting the ground, walls, or glass-hell, the only visually-pleasant sights are the game's menus and the trails of smoke that accompany smoldering, exploded and destroyed cars on their trip back to the ground. Remember those giants I was just going on about? After completing that level, you see a newspaper clipping with a sub-headline that reads, ""Who's going to remove these giant corpses from the streets?"" No one, silly! The bodies disappear when you move away from them! Other objects do the opposite, appearing as Alicia approaches their vicinity. Clipping must be one of Alicia's witchcraft powers, because she can walk through what appear to be solid chairs, tables, fire hydrants, crates-the list goes on.

All of the above problems are silhouetted by the fact that Bullet Witch is about six hours long. There are six levels, each takes about an hour to complete. Doing so earns you some Xbox 360 Achievements, but there is no way that even the most addicted Achievement freak should spend $60 on a video game that offers six levels. There are currently plans to release more content via Xbox Live, but this is a $20 product trespassing in a $60 box.

If Bullet Witch had a consistent physics engine, artificial intelligence of any kind, and even a trace of collision detection it might be an average shooter. As it is...well, in the first sentence of this review I said, ""Bullet Witch is bad."" I just repeated it, and it doesn't need to be said again. Avoid this witch's lame spell"
2.0	"Destroy All Monsters Melee not only has better graphics, but they don't have those lame mini-games (Monster Bowling?! Please). They have more monsters, yes, but the controls feel a lot clunkier for some reason. The main story had not changed at all, nor have many of the maps.

Overall, it's a disappointment. It's not horrible, but this game series took a step back when should have taken a step forward. Poor graphics, clunky mini-games...a step down from the Gamecube game"
2.0	I paid $5 for it on psn.  Put a few hours in.  I'm surprised people liked it as much as they did according to the overall rating.  It looks nice l but it is more tedious than fun.  Downright frustrating and offensively stupid mechanics at times.  Occasionally I wonder if the game devs were purposefully trolling. Good graphics but more tedious than fun.
2.0	"Were any of you alive for the ""great video game crash of 1983""? A lot of people say that E.T. was the main reason the market fell out, but that only scratches the surface. The real problem is that consumers were bamboozled into purchasing shoddy products under strong banner titles. Games were often poorly conceived, and even more often, poorly executed.

It's a strange way to begin a review, but it's appropriate for this latest piece of hurried trash, ""Fallout: New Vegas"". The concept here is solid, but the execution is abysmal. It's not the first time we've seen a game with poor quality control (""Dragon Age"" immediately jumps to mind), and in fact, it's not the first time we've seen a Fallout game with poor QC (""Fallout 3"" was riddled with freezes, marring an otherwise-excellent outing).

So, why do I hammer this game for these flaws? Well, ""Fallout: New Vegas"" is, for the most part, IDENTICAL to ""Fallout 3"". The mechanics are the same. The interaction is the same. Heck, many of the environments were completely recycled from ""Fallout 3"". How is it then that this game not only matches its predecessor in bugs, design flaws and whatnot, but in fact, trumps it mightily? It boggles the mind that a publisher would actually put their stamp of approval on this, but then again, American (and more generally, Western) game designers have long allowed shoddy products off their lines. After all, if you can patch it, what's the big deal? <cue sarcastic eyeroll>

Anyway, let me begin with:

The Good:

1) The Universe. The fallout universe remains entertaining enough for this endeavor. While this game feels like little more than a very long expansion of ""Fallout 3,"" that's not a bad thing inherently. The Mojave desert makes for a nice post-apocalyptic setting, and the El Dorado of New Vegas is a satisfying destination. Moreover, the character development system remains as fun as ever. There is one problem with this, I will detail below: it is completely unbalanced. But the idea is sound, even the execution is horrible.

2) Hardcore mode. What a splendid idea. You mean I can't stay up for hundreds of hours at a time without eating food or drinking water? It's nice to see this implemented in the game. It makes for a completely different experience, and is well worth the effort.

3) Factional Reputation. This is what ""Fallout 3"" should have been about. Morality is a tricky thing in the wake of a nuclear holocaust. Relativism is the obvious answer. Here we are introduced (or perhaps re-introduced, although I haven't played Fallout or Fallout 2) to reputation. Rather than having a single overarching trait determine your standing with people, you can develop different feels with different groups. A great idea. My only problem with it is this: while there are many titles you can get, they all pretty much do the same thing. I saw now discernible difference between being ""vilified"" and being a ""merciful thug"". Both of these resulted in my being shot on sight. Also (for some stupid reason), karma remains, which somewhat poisons the experience, but I'll mention that below.

The Bad:

1) Glitches. Bugs. Whatever you want to call them, they're here, and they are pathetic. Firstly, the game freezes often. During my first playthrough, I encountered over 20 freezes (in a 30-hour endeavor). That's unacceptable. But it goes deeper than that, even. Many quests are completely bugged, and cannot be finished under certain circumstances. I was pleased to complete a particular Brotherhood of Steel quest...until I found out that it actually would never be completed, because of some decisions I had made. While trying to combat a computer virus, my high Science ability...ensured that I could never complete the task, because of yet another bug. I tried to help a rape victim overcome her psychological trauma...or I would have, if yet another bug caused her never to speak to me. And the beat goes on. And on. And on.

The fact is, this is pathetic. I don't spend top dollar to hear some stupid computer nerd make excuses as to why I shouldn't expect a complete product. Fix the $&%! game, or don't release it. It's even more angering to hear critics praise this game, despite the numerous bugs in the final product. I can deal with reading some fan say, ""I can deal with this! 5 stars!"" But a supposedly impartial critic (IGN, I'm looking in your direction)? Unacceptable.

2) Game balance. Assuming you can deal with the myriad bugs in the product, you will find that the game is highly unbalanced. Back when I first read about this game in Game Informer, I was told of how little-used perks would be incredibly useful this time around. I heard that some skills would be so much more useful. It's a total lie.

The worst offender is in fact the skill. While weapon skills are OK (although the balance still tends towards guns being the best, and explosives being the worst, IMHO), the other skills are either overpowering, or laughable. Speech? Incredible skill. You can pretty much do whatever you want, whenever you want, with high speech. In fact, there are many things you simply CAN'T do without it. Science? Fantastic skill. With the exception of the bug I mentioned above, science gets you out of a lot of scrapes, AND you can hack computers. There aren't as many this time around (or at least I didn't find them), but they do great things.

On the other hand, a skill like Barter? Pathetic. Sure, I can get more money, but why would I care? You'll be overflowing in caps most of the time (particularly if you use guns - you will never have to buy or pay for repairs or ammo). There are a scant few speech challenges, and even then, most of them can be done with high speech. Another loser is medicine. Sure you can get more oomph from stimpaks, but you'll find so many on your mission, it's totally pointless. I can remember two times where medicine came up in a non-trivial way in challenges. One was for a side mission which was not listed in my journal (and thus completely unimportant). The other came up in one of the main quests, and it turns out that even if I didn't have it, I would have been fine.

In short, regardless of your build, some skills NEVER show any worth, while others are INCREDIBLE. Poor planning for a game that was supposed to restore some balance to this system.

3) Karma. What's the point? As far as I can tell, karma did NOTHING in the game, other than give one additional screenshot during one of the endings. Your karma is completely irrelevant to factional repuation as far as I can tell. Why even put it in? Do I really have to hear how bad I am when I am helping Caesar's Legion against the NCR? Anyway, there are no trophies associated to it, so feel free to do what you want.

So, there you have it. I would recommend this only for the biggest of fans, and even then, you're likely to be disappointed. ""New Vegas"" really brings nothing new to the table, and the shoddy execution manages to mar everything.

As the Legion would say, caveat emptor. QC, people!"
2.0	"If you have played this game in the arcade or on a Dreamcast unit you know how fast and colorful a fighting game this one is.  Truth is it is one of  the best 2D figthers you can play.
Here is the bad news though,  if you  own a Playstation and want this translation you will be disapointed when  you play.  First of all the lack of the tag feature really does kill this  game.  Without being able to tag in another teamate mid battle it takes  away some of the games statagy.  I think it also seems to move and load  much slower on the playstation than in the Dreamcast.  We just have to face  it, this game is a next generation game on a five year old piece of  hardware, and it just does not live up to its true potential.  I love my  plastation, but I have to advise all to pass on Marvel vs. Capcom for it.  Play Street Fighter Alpha 3 instead if you insist on getting the best 2D  fighting action you can out of your old Playstation box. Lack of the Tag Feature really hurts the Playstation here"
2.0	"i bought this game on x box live games on demand which i would suggest because its half the price. i thought this game would be fun which it was some what but not as good as i thought it would be. what made me mad about the game was the aiming i spent so many rounds on solid head shots but it was as if they were going 5 feet over their head and another thing about the game is you could spend half a clip putting the rounds center mass and the guys still shooting at you. the grenades had no damage range what so ever they could be with in 4 feet of it with no cover and not take any damage what so ever. also with the melee attcaks the guys hitting you as if its a marvel vs capcom game as in the guys hitting you with non stop combos.now my last bad thing about this game is no story line or character reprensentation what so ever you don't get to know the other soilders at all its as if everytime your fighting its with a diffrent platoon everytime. so thats my thought on the game bad wise heres the good. i liked the thought of jumping into every mission i thought the fact of you landing in diffrent spots in a mission could help you or hurt you and it was all up to you where you landed and the olny other good thing was the missions were pretty long and thats about it and the weapons upgrades were kinda cool to deal with. i forgot to add this to the bad as someone who has been in the military and know the ranks why is a colonol wearing a private stripe on his shoulder just a thought to the medal of honor games creaters you may want to check stuff like that before you start selling the game.

CONS:
aiming is terrible
computer enemy could take to much damage
you don't get to know the characters as in attitude or anything
and th ecomputer enemy has a crazy *** melee attack
these creaters don't know their ranks

PROS:
long missions
the concept of landing anywhere is pretty nice
weapons up grade weren't as bad as i thought

and i wanted to add this part here i will never buy another WWII game again from the medal of honor series in fact if the new one that set in future time isn't rated M and goods a good review i will never buy another medal of honor game ever ill just stick to the good old call of duty games which seem to actually know how to make a good FPS game. think twice about this game before getting it"
2.0	"First, let me say, Enclave has beautiful graphics. But after playing it awhile, I found myself frustrated by my inability to generate my own character, or to be able to start out with a character of my own gender (female). True, later on, you can select a new character at each level, but after a while, I just found myself NOT caring about playing any further.
I prefer games with a little plot and a LOT more diversity at the get go. Enclave just failed to grab my interest. Great Graphics...."
2.0	"I don't quite get the appeal of Maniac Mansion.  It's strictly about solving puzzles while roaming the rooms and hallways of a really small mansion.  It's not action-based or interesting in any way other than the ironic and comedic portions that involve aliens and their many hilarious one liners.  There's strategy in making your way through the house but it's kind of tacky due to the game being so short and feeling incomplete.  There's no action whatsoever so the replay value is nonexistent which is another major issue with the game.

Maniac Mansion feels like it's caught between Home Alone and A Boy and His Blob except it lacks the suspense of Home Alone and the clever puzzle solving and adventure of A Bob and His Blob.  I'm not sure whether Maniac Mansion is based off a movie or not because the music is memorable enough to reach a level higher than video games.  It's fully developed and well-written enough to be comparable to a TV show theme.  That's what makes me suspicious that the game may be a video game version of a movie or show (or perhaps cartoon).  Each selectable character has their own theme song, and with the orange-haired guy the music is exceptionally memorable because it's some kind of groovy upbeat, danceable tune multi-part song that sounds like mid 80's Frank Zappa.  The orange-haired lady has a theme that reminds me of the late 70's/early 80's rock band the Cars.  Really awesome and catchy music at least.

Though the story doesn't make a bit of sense and the game is based entirely on solving clues Scooby Doo style, at least the occasional dialogue provides a few short laughs.  Otherwise a really forgettable and highly overrated video game that you'll never play again unless it's 20 years later and you're looking to take a trip down memory lane. unpleasant mansion on the hill"
2.0	Look, The Witcher 2 is not a bad game, per se, but it misses too many notes in its own genre for my liking. No real class system, no variety in armors or weapons, no character customization & no real freedom to speak of. This game is so linear, it's almost on par with rail shooters. And, if you haven't played 1, 2 doesn't make a ton of sense, even with the added features. I'd rent it if it was something you really wanted to play, otherwise, just skip it. Overrated & Pathetically Linear
2.0	"In all honestly, how could a game series take this big of a step backward? I mean even the best or most average of game series' take a while and a few bad sequels to degrade to such a point (example Mega Man X5~X7). How could one even work on the development team with a straight consciousnesses knowing you were developing and planned to release such a inferior product? These are the questions about Xenosaga II that keep me up at night...

But seriously (no I don't say up at odd hours of the night pondering about what Xenosaga II could have, should have been), for as great as the original was and the amount of hype this game received, Xenosaga II is a perfect example of a 'almost' complete bust.

First off, the game is way to short. I was really surprised I was on disc 2 after 7 hours of gameplay. I'm not quite sure, but does Xenosaga II use dual layer DVD's like the first Xenosaga, cause if it does and that's all they put on the first disc, that's pretty sad. It's almost seems they put it on two normal DVD's instead of a dual layer disc just to give the player the illusion that because it's two discs it must be a  long game. Nice marketing tactic guys, gamers aren't as dumb as you think...

Xenosaga II's battle system is absolutely horrendous; it's up there with Legend of Dragoon's battle system in my book (I love to bash that game to no end). Expect to die a few times and spend a few hours taking a severe beating (especially if your battle party is surrounded by enemies ~ that's the definition of fun!) until you get the hang of it. Add to the fact the longer you take to enter a command, the more likely the enemy is going to boost and slap you around in the next turn. To add to this atrocity, add the fun of constantly stocking and boosting attacks in conjunction with airing and downing a opponent to cause any kind of reasonable damage. Then add to that fact not all characters can damage airborne opponents. Combat in Xenosaga I may have been a little basic and simplistic, but at least it was easy to pickup and learn, you almost need a degree (or a really good guide) to get anywhere in Xenoaga II. Oh, and don't get me started on the Mech or E.S. combat. While character combat is confusing to no end, E.S. combat is so pathetically simple it makes the gear combat in Xenogears look good in comparison.

As for side quests, add another point to the lame column. 35 sub quests helping complete strangers out of their stupid, insignificant daily problems they won't remember a week from now while the fate of the universe swings in the balance of your quest's success. Yeah sure, that sounds like fun as well. If I don't like to help complete strangers within the real world with their problems, what makes game developers think I want to do it in a video game? Come on!

Graphically, Xenosaga II is pretty much the same as the original, which makes me wonder why they hyped up that part of the game so much? Do they think gamers are so fixated on that lone aspect of a game, they are willing to forgive flaws in execution and gameplay? I mean, you can take the most graphically gorgeous game, and if the gameplay stinks, the game as whole suffers. Xenosaga II, as a game, proves this theory without a doubt.

As for sound or music, you actually better off turning the volume off, unless you're viewing a cut scene. Most of the music is pretty bad (a slim few interesting tracks do exist), and the voice acting is decent, outside battle that is. In battle, the voices make you cringe, where talking ""Star Ocean: The 2nd Story"" sound bite territory here. MOMO has to be the worst, the first time you hear her say ""I'll lend support"" you just want reach though the TV screen, or hope she reaches puberty before the series is over.

On the plus side (yes, their is a plus side ~ surprisingly) Xenosaga II's story continues on the rich tale from the first game, even if it seems a little touch and go, and they seem to focus too long on certain characters (the first disc is basically Jr. and MOMO centered); the second disc plays like ""hey, we forgot about the core of the story, let's go find the Zohar"".

The bottom line, if you like the story, you should play Xenosaga II, despite all it shortcomings. Actually, I'd recommend renting the game instead of buying it, it's short enough, and it'll teach the developers a very meaningful lesson. If this game becomes a greatest hit, like the original, I'd be very suprised (but it probably will just because I said that). Namco's got guts releasing a mediocre game after the hype"
2.0	"OK, first off  Im an Old school gamer and i know people that work in the industry  ...i started gaming with the Atari 2600 and ive been having a blast since then!

i still play with my NES, snes, gamecube, n64, sega systems, playstations, xboxes, colecovision, turbo grafx 16, neo geo, amoung others...even imports so i know what im talking about here..

i like Nintendo..its a great gaming company and they have always had awesome systems and 3rd party games that really shined...when i think of playing nintendo  its mostly on the nes or snes (classics never go out of style..in fact some of them are more fun to play even today!  i know im not alone on this one)

when the Wii came out  like everybody i was looking forward to see what was Nintendo's next gen system like.. but when i saw the gameplay using that weird controller IT WAS A REAL LETDOWN..now im not hating or anything here, but motion usage in video games don't really work...remember the power pad, the power glove etc? even some on some wii games  this tech dosent really work...  yep this is one system that will sit in your closet collecting dust..thats where mine is  and will be for a long time i bet.

 i gave the wii a chance, and well  it didn't feel like nintendo.  first off the system was rushed to  be released to compete with the Xbox 360 and the playstation 3..both systems which  are FAR MORE SUPERIOR in hardware and processing ..which gives stellar graphics. the wii's graphics are lackluster at best...think of a dressed up gamecube...nothing really eye poping when you think of next gen systems...

 lets talk about games...you want to play a campaign with master chief, or call of duty modern warfare?  well you find these games on the wii...but you'll find almost every nintendo  child friendly remake.. super mario wii?  give me a break..how about making a new character or something?  mario was cool  but is played out you look at the wii section  90 percent of the games are aimed at small children..minus some of the cross platform games .

 for games on the wii  they are mostly dumbed down to compensate for that weird controller again  and the short attention spans of the player..  the wii is a system thats  a party system to be dragged out when  people come over...its Not a real gaming system...i know the fanboys will likely rip into this  but hey,  have you looked at yourselves..waving a controller around  playing games like animal crossing? (giggles here)

the online system for the wii is a JOKE  it cant compare to  xbox live or the ps network..  the whole virtual console is a good idea, but for gamers like me that have our original games and systems still..this is not making the wii stand out.
  when i tried the online system for nintendo..it was so lackluster and bland..

You can tell this system was  developed with the soccer moms and familys in mind...thats why its so cheap..that gimmick worked for them in the beginning but now all systems have price cuts..if you want an awesome system..get a ps3 or a 360  heck, even a gamecube  that still is  a great system!  see Nintendo used to make great systems...

where i work, if i get somebody looking for a great system  i tell them about all 3  and most  skip on the wii.

Hopefully, the next system from nintendo will be worthy of their name..and the wii left in the dust. Yes..i actually played with this system... its meger at best"

2.0	I'm a big halo fan but the halo reach way too short and finishing was horrible nothing special ,allover i'm not amazed with this game but should played if you are a halo fan. Shortest halo ever !
2.0	"Like others, this review is not about Amazon re-sellers or third party vendors. Also, I am giving my review under the context that, at the time I am typing this, it's Jan 2013. So please keep that in mind and read ahead.

I am a huge PS3 fan. While the console is not perfect, the system has plenty of games almost for anyone, regardless of the age. The only thing that still was driving me crazy is that once I moved to PS3 I stopped using my PS2 games and just because the new consoles are not compatible with older ones.

Knowing that the 60GB old units can play both type of games (PS3 plus PS2) I took the chance. However, the unit worked for about 24 hrs and after that, it refused to play  PS3 games again, caput, dead! It worked for some of the PS2 games I have, but sporadically, which made me believe it was a console issue not because my games. The console was taking the disc without any issue though, you can even heard the spinning disc inside, but the system was not playing the disc's information at all, nothing.

So ... I wanted to give the unit a chance :-)  ... and because I received it during a weekend, I had the whole Sunday and part of Saturday to troubleshoot the problem and see if it was a software issue, not hardware (unlikely, but really wanted to try)

That weekend the wife got little or not attention from my side :-) I performed a full system format, quick reset of the console settings, tried bunch of games and even manually clean the discs myself, hoping it was some scratched disc  ... I did everything possible that was not hardware invasive, you name it ... and nothing worked! I literally spent my whole weekend on the issue but the unit never played a single PS3 game ever again. Actually, after a few hours it also stopped playing PS2 games as well, which the console was reading hours before, sporadically, but it was.

After Google this a bit more the Monday after, I found that this is a typical problem on most of these older units. The PS3 games are Blue Ray discs; the laser and circuit that is in charge of reading that is prone to problems so if that part or parts stopped working, you ended with a unit that will only read and play older PS2 games, which are not Blue Ray discs of course. It can be fixed replacing that part in the motherboard, but I do not have the time for that. And to be honest, I would not recommend anyone to spend extra bucks and time fixing a unit that in computer terms is ancient and already obsolete.

Long story short, I returned it to Amazon. Thanks God the seller was Amazon Prime endorsed and while it took few days, I finally received my money back.

I guess that I will have to display and connect my old PS2 box to the same T.V that I used for my PS3 console, different port of course. Or resign myself and send all those PS2 games to ""Play Station heaven"", aka trash can, where they will rest in peace for ever.

Oh well, that's technology. New gadgets and advances sometimes put good stuff behind, even when is still good.

*** Bottom line ***

If you have the money and time, and you are willing to take the risk, get one of this units and see what happens. But there is no warranty whatsoever that what happened to me, will happen to you in one or two months. Hate to write bad reviews, but I feel obligated to help others and share my experience during the process, especially when Sony already informed that a new console will be released in spring of this current year, making this 60GB even older and more obsolete than ever. Good luck if you find a good unit."
2.0	"this game is not exactly top notch, hell its lower than bottom notch. i must say that Armorines is just as fun as this game, and thats not good in any humanly possible way...
Graphics-6: the graphics ar pretty bad, Anna does random and stupid stuff in the inventory but the backgrounds are done fairly nice. its a 3/4 overhead view so you cant see much detail on anything, but the sheer number of monsters that can appear on-screen at once is amazing. but with a little down scale on monster # appearance and background textures and a little down-tweaking on character smoothness this could have been done on the PS1, and it would have been better.
Replay-2: if you have the gut to play through this for an hour or more your a brave man who desreves thousands of dollars and a memorial all to himself. if you can pick up the game, play it for 5 mminutes and see that it wreaks ...then your a human being. if you play through the game once, all the way, your godly.
Story-1: what kinda ...game has no story? this one is a good example, you immediately strat off in a fight ina  village, the game will pick up after that right, umm NO!!! if you hate story i suggest getting this game.
Control-10: if you can tfigure out the controls you should be shot and dumped in the hoover damn, after that your remains shall be picked clean by seagulls.
Fun-3: sometimes of your bored beyond humanly possible reason you might play this for a quick burst of enjoyment while you hack up endless streams of invincible monsters for about 15 minutes before you need to go puke for every minute of gameplay. also you might wanna hit your head so you don't remember ever playing the gme as it will shatter your humanity.

2.0	"This game was great when it was first released almost 15 years ago. Games have changed since then. Basically, if you loved the game 15 years ago, you'll probably love it again now. If you never played Chrono Trigger before, you will not like it now.

The game is completely linear, just like all games were in the 90's, and that line just isn't a very fun one. For me as a kid, the combat system was fast paced and exciting. Now, I literally found myself tapping the A button as fast as possible to try and get through each fight. Developers have made huge improvements in fighting systems since 1995, and this ""remake"" is just a reminder of that. Verdict: Skip it. All of these great reviews are just from people who loved the game in 1995 and wouldn't dare to give it a negative review now. The reviews on popular websites (like gamespot.com)are giving Chrono Trigger such high scores because they are afraid of offending fans. I would recommend a brand new game, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-Ends-With-You/dp/B00136MBHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World Ends With You</a>."" all you need to know about chrono trigger ds..."
2.0	"My Intercooler arrived today but after a few excited moments I quickly realized that the problem wasn't my lack of upper arm strength but rather the Intercooler having a plug interface that is not compatible with the power cord on the xbox 360.

Admittedly I'm nervous about some of the reviews here sighting broken machines though its hard to believe some of them when there are problems with early xbox 360's that could have been the issue. I'm just not willing to find out with my machine until I hear differently from reputable independent sources (consumer reports anyone?). Powercord does not connect"

2.0	"I wasn't a big fan of the Burnout series.  I tried to like this game.  I just wanted a causal racing game that didn't involve power ups.  People were telling me to buy the game but when I did, I wanted my money back.

Graphics, sound, controls, & music are great.  Can't complain about that.  The gameplay is what I didn't like.  To much emphases on getting a power meter for super speed and hitting cars.  The computer would always beat me many times.  Even when I put the game on easy mode.  I felt frustrated and couldn't take it anymore.

If your a fan of the Burnout series, pick it up.  For casual racing fans you probably will want to skip this and go somewhere else. Its not that great of a game."
2.0	"I love baseball, and usually MVP gets my nod every year for being fun and exciting. But this portable version trying to take after it's bigger cousin, falls flat on it's face and EA Sports should no better than to release this 1/2 arsed effort.

So what's wrong? How about the choppy graphics after the first pitch? How about the batting game being boring. It makes hitting an extremely simple process against the computer. The computer pitchers usually pitch about 2 strikes for every four pitches, so your guaranteed a hit every time.  I hit five home runs in a row for three games straight and the challenge was just not there. I just felt an overall lack of any fun, it was just a batting farce, not a true baseball sim.

 So, They simply slapped the ""MVP"" name on the box and knew it would sell, and that is being nice. The game looks pretty bad for a PSP game. The player models look good, but the in game action is no where near the quality of MLB baseball.  The load times as mentioned by some are very long and unforgiving and the gameplay seems choppy when the ball hits the field. There is no franchise (which is unforgiving) and the gameplay is lathargic at best.  The game itself looks like an old Playstation title on the PSOne, which is unacceptable because many of the sports titles like NBA Street and NFL Street look 10 times better than this. Like I said, defintely feels like a rush job, E.A. can do much better. I did like the sound effects and commentary, but the crowd noise is repetitive, it sounds like the fans were recorded at 3 second intervals and played over and over.  Even crazier, the game froze up on me twice!!! Really!

**Bottomline: Wait for something else or give MLB for PSP a try. MVP Baseball is anything but the MVP this year, it's back to the minors for E.A. A rush job to say the least. MLB is a better bet this time."
2.0	I loved the first Resident Evil Revelations game when I played it back in 2013. It took me by surprise how awesome the whole game was. The graphics and soundtrack were great, the plot was interesting and I ended up finishing the game 3 times. I was really hyper for Revelations 2 when it was announced last year, but after playing the game I sadly have to say that the game was big let down for me. The graphics doesn't look as good as the first game. Everything just looks really blend and not interesting. The ship and back tracking on the first game brought atmosphere and tension to the game, while the level design of Revelations 2 is remarkably uninspired an lack the creativity from the first game. I also didn't really enjoy the co-op in the game. You have to keep baby sitting your partner the whole game, and even though the AI is not as bad as in RE5, it is still really annoying. I would much rather prefer if you partner AI was exactly like in the first Revelations game. Overall I would recommend to buy the game when it is 10 or 15 dollars, not more than that. I really hope for the third game, Capcom goes back the the formula they created in Revelations 1. Huge disappointment..
2.0	"This is a good game, but not a great one. I hate to say it (because I like the loose concept of the game), but I was disappointed with Shenmue. I have to give recognition to the fine artistry and graphical quality. However, herein lies the problem.
So much emphasis was put on the graphics that they forgot to add the game. Shenmue really isn't a video game at all. It is more like you are watching a movie and every once and awhile you have to pause it, do some tedious task, and then you get to watch a little more. You really don't feel like part of the game. It often felt to me that I was not playing at all, but watching someone else play. I kept waiting my turn, and before I got my turn the game was over. This problem was also exemplified by the fact that you can not die (lose, be killed, whatever you choose to call it). I don't know about you, but I like a bit of a challenge. Not even having Ryo's fate in my hands made me feel even more like a bystander.
One other problem I have (probably the most significant to me) is that after all that ""playing"" you find out that you are just going to have to wait for the next video game to see what happens. You can form your own opinions about that, but I have to admit that I felt a bit taken. I just wanted to play a game. I didn't sign up for some long-term deal where I would have to buy several sets of discs to find out what happens. They should call the game Shenmue: Chapter One. At least then you would know that your entire [money] is going to only one chapter and not an entire game.
If you want to see some great graphics and casually watch one chapter of a story unfold, then this game is for you. However, if you want a challenge, the possibility of losing, a game that may come out differently if you were to play it again, I don't think Shenmue is for you. I recommend Half-Life and Final Fantasy 9 for many hours of video game enjoyment. Happy gaming. Good Graphics, but they forgot the game!"
2.0	"Final Fantasy XIII is a beautiful game. the visuals and music are excellent. Thats about all the game has going for it. the story isn't outstanding among the rest of the series, but that is okay with me and not the biggest flaw with the game.

The game leads you from Point A to Point B on a narrow path with nice (but unreachable) scenery, much like some first person shooters. the small map sizes are a step backwards from the large branching maps of Final Fantasy XII. Can you believe that the 8-bit Zelda has more exploration than FFXIII? Its true.

Battle system is excellent. Its the best turn-based menu driven battle system in the genre. If you love battling, you will love this game, as thats all there is to do, even the side quests are battles but with tougher enemies. There isn't any variety at all to the gameplay. Fight, run down the road a little, fight, run down the road a little more, boss fight, cutscene, run down that LONG road more, repeat.

With modern day RPGs offering so much variety and exploration as well as compelling stories, its disappointing FFXIII hasn't offered a comparable experience. It would have been an EXCELLENT game last generation on PS2, but the series needs to get with the times. Jogging down the railway, trying to save the world"
2.0	These games have too many  objectionable objects in them such as ghosts, magic items, blood & gore, dead things etc. not clean fun for the whole family. Insider Chronicles
2.0	"Made me sad. The game totally dropped all hints of love from its predecessors. I played through it in a weekend and it left me wanting. So I tried nightmare, it had no appeal. I dropped the game after a month. They implemented an online money buying system which totally ruins the game and seems like they are money grabbing. Story was basically fell short in comparison to all other diablo games. From my understanding the creators of the original 2 were not in this one, and its very obvious. I advise you stay away from this purchase. You can have my copy, I don't use it.

2.0	Twice as thick as needed, when I installed on the bottom board chips it started to flex the board and I had to cut into like a third to get the thickness I needed. Twice as thick as needed.
2.0	"My girlfriend plays ""Oblivion"" and ""Skyrim"" and has all of the DLC for each of those games on PS3. She bought this anthology to complete the set. I -- and, probably, she -- didn't know that the first two games in the series were now available for free online (according to the top Amazon review here, anyway), so she really just bought a nice box of DVDs and maps and basically spent $30 (down from $80) on ""Morrowind"" for PC.

Unfortunately, ""Morrowind"" is very glitchy when it comes to loading up or stopping the game on 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise with Service Pack 1. I know the game is over a decade old now, but if it's going to be re-sold, you'd think that a little more testing would have been done before re-releasing it into Production for later iterations of the Windows operating system. Disappointing, to say the least. ""Morrowind"" very glitchy when starting/stopping game"
2.0	"This game could easily have been great. The main character moves with ease and his moves are complex. There's an expansive list of upgrades, items, and abilities, all great things for a Castlevania title. However, this game's perfect character interface is where the ""good"" ends, for me.

The world starts off good enough, great even. At least when you step out of the forest and beyond the Castle's first few rooms and into the first (of five) world(s) of the game. Soon, you realize that the developers were rushed to complete a game for Konami. The rooms and hallways, you'll notice within the first hour, have been 'cut and pasted' throughout the entirety of the game's 5 levels. The skins of the rooms might look different (a little), but you'll see the similarities, unless, of course, you are blind, that is.

The music is great, also, at first, anyway. The soundtrack when first entering the Castle is quiet, creepy, and atmospheric. As you continue onward, it gets better...for the first floor of the first level. Then, well...the soundtrack becomes a bouncy and annoying blend of club music and gothic-not a good mix, in my opinion, at least not to the extent that this soundtrack took it. The music was way too active and obnoxious for the lack of action that is really going on on the screen in front of you. That said, the first few tracks in the game are some of the best in the series.

The bosses are WAY too easy. The puzzles are WAY too simplistic. And eventually you find yourself wishing the game would have simply been made with 3D graphics and 2D level design (why not!?) Castlevania is, to me, a Platforming Action RPG. Lament of Innocence has a few moments of platforming throwbacks, but they're ruined by the game's unmovable camera. This game pretty much relies upon its stationary camera angle, because if you were allowed to move it, you'd be able to see all of the games ""hidden"" items plain as day: that's bad game design, if you ask me....

It's sad to say it, but as hard as I tried and wanted (believe me, I was pumped to play this game again) it to be a great CV game, it simply is not great. It's better all other 3D Castlevania games, however, Lords of Shadow included. But that's not saying much, being that game was a mediocre ripoff blending of God of War and Shadow of the Colossus.

I wish there could be a great 3D Castlevania, but until they keep the simple things in the game that make Castlevania Castlevania intact, they'll fail over and over again. Could Have Been Great...but"
2.0	"I have been a fan of the Lufia games since the first one was released on the SNES here in America.  When I heard the Game Boy Color was receiving an Estopolis game, I was immediately e-mailing Natsume.  ""Will you guys be releasing it in America as Lufia 3?""
It's finally here.  I plug it in.  All indications--pretty graphics, fun dialog, wonderful battle system, great play mechanics, good storyline, even great music, the best on the Game Boy Color--cause me to smile and giggle and thank the heavens.  I'm enthused to say the least.
Then I figure it out.  Every dungeon is completely random.  But I keep playing.  And playing.  And I try so hard to like it.  SO hard.  The storyline is keeping me going, the combat is wonderful.
Every dungeon may be random, but they are all EXACTLY the same.  Wander around hitting walls and things until you've explored the level the go to the next.  10 or so levels later, you have a boss fight and a story sequence.
Repeat.
Repeat.
My heart is absolutely broken.  How can this happen?  The heart of the Estopolis games has always been the wonderful dungeons, now replaced by this absolute drudgery.
Try before you buy, and make sure you have tissues to dry your tears.  I am praying that the Game Boy Advance Estopolis is released here, and that the dungeons, while they will still be random, will be more sensical and have non-random segments.
This game had everything going for it, and one major flaw destroys it.  Why oh why? Breaks my heart..."
2.0	"I know there are a lot of MMO players that don't like forced grouping in an MMO. And I also know a lot of people ""solo"" play MMO's, due to various reasons, time, just like the playstyle, challenge, social anxiety disorder, etc. This doesn't mean that they're anti-social either, so let's just get that out of the way. That's why I thought it was important to just give a heads up to those potential players who are considering getting this game that FFXIV:ARR forces grouping just to progress your basic character class/job. I've played several MMO's over the years, and this is the first one that I've played that forces you to do dungeons (forced grouping) just to proceed in the game. Usually from my experience dungeons or group content was always optional and didn't really prohibit you progressing in the game, but FFXIV:ARR most certainly does place dungeon gating in your path and they aren't optional. This gating isn't about getting gear, it's about how they force your character progression story into dungeons just to proceed forward. You really can't skip it and continue to progress your character. I personally, don't like having to rely on others just to progress my basic character progression. I know a few MMO's have used forced grouping in their design, but most modern MMO's have moved to incorporate various options to accommodate different playstyles. That's a good thing. Forced grouping in FFXIV:ARR just basically killed the game for me. I like having options and it's simply you either group or quit playing. That's not for me, so I just quit and will continue with another MMO that doesn't force dungeons/force grouping on you. I understand that the forced dungeons/forced grouping is the FFXIV:ARR developers design, and that's fine. It's their decision to force that. It's just a old game mechanic that I don't agree with. I gave 2 stars for the beautiful graphics and beautiful music. Just wanted to warn people about the forced grouping game mechanic, so people could decide if they are ok with that or not.

Update about the gated content: Just to further explain the mandatory dungeons/forced grouping just to get access to basic game features. Examples: 1. Airship travel to other cities. You have to complete a mandatory dungeon to open the quest which leads you to getting an airship pass. 2. Getting your chocobo mount. You have to complete a mandatory dungeon to open the quest which leads you to getting your chocobo mount. These are two basic examples of how the content is gated and locked behind the story quest line. You have to do it, just to open up basic game features. You can't sidestep the story line quest, and be able to progress forward. Even getting access to something as simple as getting a inn room in Uldah requires you to complete part of the story quest line just to be ""okayed"" to the inn owner. This MMO is restricting players and dictating how they proceed. It would be different if the story line quest was separate from your character progression. You know, optional. So if you decide to do that quest line, then great, you can. If you decide not to, then that's okay too, you can continue to access mounts, airships, etc, without being forced down their preset path. But unfortunately, that's not how this MMO works. FFXIV:ARR is not open and free to progress as openly as say Rift or WoW worlds are, for example. To be honest, FFXIV:ARR felt a lot like SWTOR (Star Wars The Old Republic) when playing it. FFXIV:ARR is basically a single player RPG, with MMO bolted on the side, with mandatory dungeons. You have class leveling and then crafting and that's about it. This game is way overhyped for what it is, and I believe a lot of people are just being dazzled by the pretty graphics and nice music to see that this MMO bring absolutely nothing new to the genre. My review was to warn the segment of MMO players that don't like forced grouping mechanics or gated content on what to expect if they are thinking about this game. Personally I believe FFXIV:ARR will turn F2P in less than a year because there is really nothing here to warrant a sub fee. I'm sure the white knights of SE will descend upon any who doesn't give this MMO a five star rating. Forced dungeons / Forced grouping"
2.0	works but didn't come with a battery cover ...was not told this would happen if so i would have bought it from another seller buyer beware
2.0	Worked great in the beginning.  Though over time I had to position the cable a certain way for it to charge. Worked great in the beginning
2.0	"I have been waiting in gitty anticipation for this game for a long time.  I bought the origonal Halo when it first came out and have been a diehard fan of the franchise ever since.  This was not what I was expecting.  Let me say that graphicaly this game is realy nice and parts of it are fantastic.  I realy love getting to delve deeper into the character's of Cortana and Master Chiefe.  But these things were not enough to save the game's shorcomings in my eyes.

SPOILER ALERT------------------------------------------------------------

From the getgo when you start the game something feels wrong.  the new soundtrack does not jive with the old Halo spirit.  It instead is somber with exotic wailing voices.  It doesnt speak ""here comes the invincible hero to save us all"" it screams ""lets all cry"".  getting into the game things look up.  MC has a new look I don't realy like all that much but it isn't enough to spoil how beautiful the game looks.  Immediatly I was impressed with the new cortana.  You can realy feel her emotions and humanity just pours from her.  Almost immediatly you are thrust into a fight with a splinter of the covenant that didn't get the memo.  This just all feels wrong, the voices of the various creatures are messed up and while their tactics are similar I just couldn't shake the feeling that the flow of combat was completely off.  Grunts have wierd buzzy voices that sound like some sort of swarming insect and the elietes barely make sounds other than growling.  What happened to ""wort wort wort"" and ""die devil!"".  Most noticable as well grenades seem powered down, almost useless against anything but grunts.

Continuing on eventualy hou have to fight the prometeans.  At first I was exited but then you quickly figure out that fighting the prometheans realy doesnt differ much at all from fighting the covenant.  The big guys behave almost identicaly to elietes other than they can telleport and the little ones are like fast moving grunts that crawl on the walls.  Further promethean weapons just act like human weapons with new visuals.  Fortunatly with incredible writing was enough to keep driving me through the game.

The story unfortunatly takes a turn for the worse.  While we get to find out loads more about the MC and Cortana (like that they were both planned creations by an ancient forerunner called the librarian), and while we learn all sorts of interesting things about the forerunners and ancient human ancestors all this is spoiled in my eyes when they decided to write the death of the most beloved character from the Halo franchise.  As many would know one of the major plot points of the game is that Cortana is going rampant ""basicaly breaking down"" and MC is trying to get her some help.  Hope is always on the horizon in this game, hell they even find an artifact that can turn information into physical reality.  But the end of the games sees Cortana sacrifice herself so MC can get home (So the librarian put a seed in humanity that would lead to the cration of MC and an AI who would who would be driven torturously insane and have to become a scfifical lamb, kinda screwed up and n my eyes the reason she couldn't go with MC was a copout).  Cortana has always been MC's human side and I think 343 is trying to kill her off so they can humanise MC.  Whatever the reason I was left feeling sour and kinda pissed.  But still I held on hope thinking ""maybe they will show us she is still alive after the credits"" because halo always has a legendary ending.  So I waited till the credits rolled and I was greeted with a scene of MC taking off his armor and seeing a glimpse of his face....  thats it...  I don't care about his stinking face I want Cortana!  Without Cortana there is no Halo franchise.

2.0	This game looked cool after I read about it a month or so before it came out.  I bought it and I do admit it was fun when I first played it but there's not much to the game after the first few hours.  The graphics leave much to be desired with simple polygons and such and the zoom levels aren't that good.  You start out with $20,000 or so to build your mall.  You will be lost without completing the tutorial which is tricky.  I needed help from the game's message board (provided free on-line) just to finish it.  You build walls, entrances, atriums and of course stores.  There are four types of stores to choose from with a good selection of products such as clothes, electronics, housewares, etc.  But once the mall is built it gets boring. There are only like 5 or 6 types of shoppers and it does not show them in your stores.  They simply walk up to the entrance, disappear and then reappear with bags.  I built an ATM and pay phones and no one even used them.  There are also basic repeating animations such as clerks inside each store which get very boring.  The game has little replay value.  It is a cool idea but could have been a lot better. fun at first but got boring fast
2.0	I played it once, got pretty bored as everything was pretty repetitive.  When purchased, Amazon had it labeled as 2 players.  Its a single player game! Boring
2.0	The multiplayer for this game is littered with campers hiding on a tower a mile away that are sniping you. I find it truly boring. If you're into slow-paced hiding and shooting people that have no chance at killing you, this is your game. However, the presentation is very nice, and the server browser is a nice addition in a console FPS. Too slow-paced and ruined by Snipers/Campers

2.0	"This game is getting stellar critical reviews and even better reviews on this, so I know you guys are going to hate my review.  This is one man's opinion.

Feel matters a lot to me in a game.  Particularly one that's primarily a shooter.  Without the gimmicks, this really is a GTA/Red Dead/LA Noire type game--from a shooting mechanics standpoint.  I hated it from the get go.

I loved Red Dead and LA Noire, and was OK with the mechanics in those, because to me those games offered so much more.  An open world. Interesting story. Gripping characters. Worlds that are wonderful to look at.

The booze infused feel of this game and the camera style almost reminded me of ""Man on Fire"" (Denzel Washington).  It gets really old.  And that goofball dancing around in the chopper and the portrayal of the party girls early on?  This from the studio that brought us Red Dead and Noire?  Seriously?

I'm convinced more than ever that there's horrible grade inflation in critical reviews.

If you're going to give me a linear third person shooter, and not much else, you'd better work on the gunplay.  Gears perfected it.  Mass Effect 3, a freaking epic RPG, also is a better 3rd person shooter.

Sorry.  I'm glad you guys are enjoying it and hope that you do--I hated it.  Maybe I should have played it a bit longer, but I shouldn't have to work this hard to like a game. Listed for sale 20 minutes after I got it home"
2.0	"All review numbers should be high. After all, nobody buys a game they expect to hate. So when you see low scores, that's often a sign of disappointment from someone who wanted to be a fan.

i have played the PC version of Mass Effect far enough to get all the characters but quit after that. The biggest reason is technical. i've double checked a couple of times now and my system exceeds the recommended specs and i still get single digit frame rates, even with all the options turned low. This is surprising given that Mass Effect is nowhere near as pretty as other games that play just fine on my PC (Bioshock, Gears of War, Stranglehold, etc.). i don't normally have problems playing games, but this one is ridiculously slow. At a minimum, they should change their minimum and recommended specs.

The game is unstable, and when it crashes, it tends to crash your whole system. It's been a long time since i've had to reboot my PC three times an hour. i've installed the patch and done all the standard things (latest drivers, etc.) but this game just doesn't want to stay up. i know some of the problems are related to the anti-copying Secure-ROM software (which many people here have already said is unethical; at a minimum, it should tell users it will be installed and give them a way to uninstall it when they uninstall the game). My review isn't based on the ethics of Secure-ROM but i can say that it's caused me to reboot at least once. Most problems, though, i'm guessing are because the port from XBox to PC wasn't done very well.

As for the game, it's your standard Bioware game. You've probably played others and know if you like them or not. They're not for everyone. If you look at their history, Bioware has slowly moved from making role-playing games to making movies. It's well known to game designers that it's hard to get both a strong plot and open, flexible gameplay. Some games try hard (e.g., GTA) but Bioware realizes its talent is in story telling, not graphics, AI or level design (none of which the game does well; the AI is a surprising step backwards from Jade Empire but still better then KotOR). Continuing that trend, Mass Effect is a lot like watching cut scenes with occasional game play. Oddly, a lot of that game play is first person shooter. Bioware does not make good first person shooters. With the FPS aspect, the game actually feels a lot like Deus Ex, a game many people liked, but not as an FPS.

The story, characters, quests, etc. are probably pretty good. i can't say i'm in love with many of the characters (Rex is OK, but not as much fun as HK-47 or Boo). It doesn't seem as good as Jade Empire but it does offer significantly more places to explore than that game did. The love plot, a staple of all recent Bioware games, isn't done very well here (at least when i played a female character). i can't tell you how the game story, subquests, etc. turn out over the long run because i gave up on the game (80% technical reasons, 20% boredom).

As always, the graphics are serviceable but not impressive. Levels are linear and make the world feel very small (Bioware has a talent at making a major city feel like it was the size of an average high school). You still can only select two allies and you have no control over them. That's always been a ridiculous limitation which i assume they use to compensate for the poor pathfinding. Bioware AI tends to be towards the bottom end of the AAA game developers.

But you don't buy a Bioware game to, um, play a game. Bioware games are epic stories containing characters with character. If you liked previous Bioware games (or Deus Ex) and don't mind the new console FPS-like combat system, you'll probably enjoy this game. Assuming your computer will let you play it. It's probably better on X-Box"
2.0	Did not received all cables as posted when I purchased it. Two Stars
2.0	this game cheats no matter how many enemys you kill they keep respwaning that is not fair  why do the japanese soldiers never run out of ammo and you thats unfair u can not compleate a mission if you can not kill the enemy call of unfair garbage
2.0	"I really don't understand the love for this game.  The game play is slow and clunky.  The weapons suck and there are hardly any ammo or money to buy it.  You end up spending most of the game hitting people with your drill hand because fuel is also hard to come by.

Bioshock 3 is the only worthwhile game in this series, Overrated..."
2.0	"When I first heard about this game, I was excited for an interactive visual novel on the DS.  I was even more pumped when I saw it involved a detective.  I think everybody has had that secret fantasy of uncovering a case-- trench coat and all.  Unfortunately, Jake Hunter: Detective Chronicles doesn't provide you much satisfaction in living out the detective dream.

It's a shame, too, because the game seemed to have so much potential. After all, the gist of the game is pressing witnesses, finding clues, exploring leads, and solving crimes.  And to top it off, it allows players to take on the role of Jake Hunter, a Marlboro smoking, strong willed, quick witted detective, who deep down has a soft side.  Wait, did that sound familiar?  That's probably because it's stereotypical detective traits.  That should have been my first clue that there was nothing ""novel"" about this interactive visual novel.

Not just Hunter, but all of the characters are bland.  Even Hunter's assistant, Yulia, who the game tries so hard to give a supporting role to, is dull and seems more like a puppet muttering generic responses to Hunter.  After a while, the repetition becomes so tiresome, you may wish you didn't have to talk to the girl at all.  And it's not just with Yulia; it's with the majority of the characters that you have to talk to move the plot forward.

It wouldn't be so bad if the plot was something that you were so fixated in that you just had to advance it at any cost.  It's not even worth the expense of sitting through all the lackluster dialogue, typical jazzy detective music, and the uninspiring scenery.  Wait a minute, isn't this an interactive visual novel?  Isn't the narrative what should drive the entire game?  Yes, and that is probably the biggest problem with Jake Hunter:  Detective Chronicles.  The three cases you have to solve aren't intriguing enough to save the game.  Actually, there really isn't even that much of a mystery to be solved with half of them because they are predictable.  You'll pretty much have the case figured out before you get half way through it, and in this case, that's about 30 minutes in.  In fact, you'll probably have the game beat within 5-6 hours with no replay value (I can't see why you'd want to put yourself through these unoriginal cases again).

To add to all this mess, the gameplay isn't fun either.  The game is about as linear as it can get.  You can't move around or explore the atmosphere; instead you tap a button that tells you what it looks like.  You don't even have much of a choice in how you respond to the questions you're asked or what you can ask people.  If you pick the wrong choice, Hunter tells you he doesn't think that's the correct statement and forces you to pick the right comment.  To top off this big pile of boring, at the end of the day, you are quizzed on all of the facts about the case.  The quizzes just state the obvious and are a big waste of time.  I'm left to wonder, is this the best they could do to make the game interactive?

So, does the Jake Hunter:  Detective Chronicles even give you back the investment of your time and effort?  No.  My advice is that there are far better games on the DS worth your time.  A story driven game that is not more innovative than something a high school student could write (and also edit, there are some obvious spelling and grammatical mistakes) just doesn't cut it. No Detective Dream Here..."
2.0	Eh.  Triggers are more squishy than they are clicky so i didn't find that it worked that well. Eh. Triggers are more squishy than they are clicky ...
2.0	I have no problems with the delivery or system, its just the lack of games Microsoft has makes this an instant regret Another cable box unless you don't mind microsofts horrible games
2.0	Choosing good or evil doesnt change the fact that this is just another sandbox game Two Stars
2.0	This game was a major snooze-fest for me.  No idea why it's so highly regarded. About as exciting as a night of dreamless sleep.
2.0	The controller movement in these games can be slow to respond, causing the player to loose. They could have done a better job at porting the games over. The load times are longer than necessary for such a graphic-less intensive game. Too slow to load and controllers don't respond to these games like the newer games
2.0	I had to go online and search for a code that would work since the one provided wouldn't work. Ehh.
2.0	"I received this a Christmas gift, only to find that I would have to spend at least four times the price of this game to build a new system to run this on.

When contacting 'Aspyr' for a refund, they told me they could only give me a refund if the game is defective, and since I could not run it and prove its defective they could not help me (yes, real bad customer service). I even shot them my system specs for proof that I did not have the horsepower to run it, let alone the amount of money that would cost to build a system to their minimum specs... they said there was nothing they could do.

So, let me tell you... if you can just purchase the Guitar itself, do so, and leave the software to collect dust. There is a better game that you can use this guitar on called ""Frets of Fire"", its legally free, and it
will import all Guitar Hero songs into it, and it works on my system (Atholon XP 2.0 GHz) without any issues.

Frets works 100% with the USB GH3 guitar, and allows you to create your OWN songs. So you are not limited to the 70 songs on GH3.

I played this on the Wii originally (thats what got me hooked), but
now after after a few weeks of Frets, I find it more enjoyable then
GH3.

aspyr - terrible customer service, thats why I gave this a 1 star rating, I would have even been happy with another title from aspyr that worked with my system.

Thats my review (and my .02), and I hope you find it useful when purchasing titles from aspyr/activision in the future.

Thank you GH3 - You Need a New Computer!"

2.0	"These headphones aren't made for people who wear glasses. After a while of wearing them you will have a sore feeling around the ear, not ""comfortable"" at all if you are planning on wearing them for long hours. Especially, if you are taking them off and on quite frequently they will end up cracking from over use it is inevitable. My advice is *Not recommended to Hardcore gaming and for long term use* Not Hardcore gaming viable!"
2.0	"The Lancer looks very good in pictures but like every other bonus item in Video Game Collector's Editions - they look and work like the plastic-cheap-toy that it is.

This is good for display purposes only cause it's not so bad looking at it from a distance.  Your perception will change as soon as you have it on hand. Looks good in pictures, not so interesting up close"
2.0	"This latest installment of the House of 1000 Doors game series is certainly not as good as the previous ones. In fact, I was not very happy with it at all.
There are a lot of wasted movements. I don't mean the typical back-and-forth running around to find and use items, but rather some new unnecessary actions.
For example, it is not enough that you have inserted a key, but now you have to click again to turn the key.
Also, the new hidden object sessions are not the usual list of objects, but instead silhouettes of missing items; once found, the items must then be used in combinations with other objects. Other times, you are instructed to locate the object because there are shattered fragments (parts of a painting or tile mosaic; several keys, etc) that are hidden BEHIND the objects you must locate, click on, and move.

I completed both the main game and the bonus game in a few hours.
The bonus game plays very similar to previous versions: There are hidden item s in which sessions in which you locate the objects from a list and then are rewarded with one of the objects so as to continue the game.

Overall, the stories are decent, though there was potential for more. The game play is sorely lacking. I actually became angry at the unnecessary actions and the absence of content. Some of the mini games/task were too difficult or annoying, so I waited until the SKIP option became available to I could bypass them. I am giving the game two stars. I certainly hope creators of future House of 1000 Doors games learn from this mistake and put forth the efforts and creativity that made the earlier episodes so great. Decent Story; Uninspired Game Play; Blemish to the Game Series's Reputation"
2.0	"""Not sure how i feel about this one, the swinging/travel ing I know i'll get the hang of and think its actually going to work real well. The one thing that really bothers me is the way Spidermans body moves and writhes when trying to get info from a hood, its almost like he has nervous tics or is going to the DTs. Still to early to write a decent review, but i'm still playing it so that says something.""

Also wondering if this was supposed to have any pre order perks? Jury is still out but..."
2.0	"First off, I love Civ 4 and I love Civ 4 Colonization. I did enjoy the game and the gameplay. BUT, if I had it to do over again, I probably would not buy the game again, for the following reason:

This game comes with SecuRom 7.xx. As almost everyone has already pointed out in their reviews, this is a big deal. This DRM really does treat paying customers like criminals, makes the game harder to use, and makes certain that pirates have more rights than paying customers. Strong words? Yes, but consider what SecuRom does.

SecuRom first of all installs itself into Ring Level 0 of the operating system. This has higher privileges than the administrator account, meaning you can't uninstall it in ANY WAY, even if it interferes with other parts of your system. And interfere it does, as it disables or causes problems with legitimate CD burning and CD ROM emulation software, and has been reported to have conflicts with anti-virus software. And uninstalling the game does nothing to remove the SecuRom code... FireAxis apparently feels it has the right to just install this software on your machine and leave it there, whether you want it or not. The software acts as a rootkit and may introduce security holes, and the only way you can get it off is to re-install windows.

Here's the bigger issue for me though. I have a small laptop with a 12 inch screen. It is a tablet PC, and it has no integrated CD-ROM drive. I bought this computer on purpose because the smaller size gets me better battery life and better portability, especially on airplanes with limited space in the seats.

Apparently, though, in the eyes of FireAxis, I'm not allowed to buy such computers, or if I do, I can't play their game. I tried to use CD-ROM emulation software so that I wouldn't have to drag around and external CD-ROM and a bunch of power and USB cables on airplanes and car rides, and SecuRom disables the CD-ROM emulation software. It literally won't work unless the CD is in a physical drive, and since I don't have a permanent physical drive on this laptop, I generally can't play the game I purchased on this laptop.

So I won't be buying any more FireAxis games in the future, no matter how good they are, unless they are DRM free. When I spend a lot of money on software I expect to be able to use it on the computer of my choice. DRM detracts a lot from the game"

2.0	"i think it takes a long time to load and to control it with a laptop without a joystick is very difficult...

2.0	"If you just want to play halo multiplayer matches or the campaigns on the XBOX One, this is the game for you. the gameplay is great,

but everything else sucks.the only stats recorded are multiplayer matches. Campaign stats aren't recorded, no firefights, season ends on a cliff hanger,elites suck and one spartan can usually kill 3 of them barehanded in every cut scene. File share is also terrible, the menus are terrible. This game is nothing but multiplayer match making, and it's ranking system also sucks. if this was released for 20, it would be rated 4 out 5. paying anymore for this is a waste of money. The sad part is that it's still better than destiny Not worth more than $20"
2.0	"I was really hoping for something absolutely epic when I first heard news about White Knight Chronicles.  The screen shots seemed breathtaking and fighting as the epic White knight was an exciting thought; however, after dedicating many hours on this game online and off, my opinion of it quickly went sour.

You start the game by creating a custom character. I took a great amount of time creating a character that I knew I wouldn't be tired of looking at because ,unfortunately, you have to buy a key code from PSN to change the appearance of your character. (WHAT?!) You have to pay $5+tax to change the appearance?!! After you've put care and time into creating this character you will soon realize that you are a mere shadow to Leonard in the main story. You are that creepy, blank staring stage prop.  During the game, you are able to switch characters to play the character you've created; however, you are uninvolved during the cutscenes or other side conversations. The only time in which your character has complete attention is during online (co-op) play.

The combat system is absolute boredom. You battle with generic commands-slash to earn points (AC) in order to use combination attacks or special attacks. These combos and specials are MUCH too costly and the AC points take forever to earn back. Fighting in this game is more like waiting in line at a bank. It takes about 10 seconds to regenerate. Too little time to switch characters - as the menu style to switch is kind of convoluted - and enough time to be annoying.

The story is cliche and while I was hoping for something new, it completely disappointed.

The online part of it was fun for a few moments when I realized the missions were almost identical. The towns are also identical as they only give you about 5 generic buildings and one scene to choose from. If you want something custom, you'll have to pay for it..again.

SO, if you wanted a new game and don't expect anything revolutionary; this is the jrpg for you! Completely cliche JRPG"
2.0	I have yet to finish this game, and this game had frozen on me once during one of the levels. I guess it was a glitch of some sort and I had to restart my game all over again. I haven't picked it back up since, so if you're buying this game just be careful that it may glitch on you. I have yet to finish this game, and this ...
2.0	It's a good game overall, but the fight scenes are kind of lame.  The multilayer is really cool with your friends.  THe best thing about it is that it's one of the backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360 so you can play it on both consoles! Not bad
2.0	Controls are bad, enemy ai is bad, the whole game is just really bad. I regret buying this even at its very cheap stage. No, Just NO!
2.0	It's fine, but it doesn't stay extended. Would have been a lot better had it stayed extended. I taped it so it would stay at its longer length. It's fine, but it doesn't stay extended
2.0	"Game is ok.
Not a ton of fun, but acceptable I guess.
On a technical level, the game is a mess. Lots of slowdown and a terrible frame-rate.
The story is extremely strange, feels like a Japanime story I guess.. Not a bad thing mind you, but not standard fare.

The controls are OK.
Not worth more than $20.00 Not a ton of fun, but acceptable I guess"
2.0	"WET is an enjoyable third person shooter that gets all of its premises correct but fails in other major areas. I'll start with the things this game gets correct.  Rubi is cool; quick-witted, agile, talented and extremely agitated.  This frustration leads to ruthlesssness; i.e. everybody dies.  There's one mode when Rubi gets upset and is by far the most fun to be had in the game.  The screen goes red, black and white and the enraged Rubi can make quick work of her foes.  There's also a few fun sequences such as jumping car to car in traffic (like the Matrix) and falling out of a plane and those are very well executed.  She moves fairly fluently and the slow motion shooting aspect is both fun and highly functional.  Simply put, it's fun to play as Rubi.....in spurts.

This game is only good in spurts mostly because the story is flat out terrible.  The story is so convoluted, confusing and incoherent that it doesn't drive the story forward.  The only motivation to move forward is to finish the game.  The villains are forgettable, the side characters are more annoying than interesting and no character is developed...not even Rubi.  There's no back story on her as she's pretty much an assassin that lives in the desert.  Her personality nor motivation changes at all throughout the course of the game.  We are thrust right into a shooting arena and the game goes along in that manner for the entire duration.  Rubi doesn't have to learn any of the skills that carry throughout the game.  So pretty much from the jump...you're a bad a$$ and only you can stop yourself.  Rubi Malone seems like a character that can be developed a lot better than presente and some more formidable opponents should have been created.  I mean really....a guy with a gatling is your biggest competition????

The graphics are below standard.  I'm reading that that is the overall style of this type of art style but still the graphics leave much to be desired.  The fire and water look absolutely terrible (especially after playing games like Assassins Creed, Uncharted, Enslaved, Heavenly Sword etc.)  THe buildings are murky and difficult to look at and distinguish from one another, the characters are blocky...and overall the game just looks bad.  Even the cutscenes look bad. It looks like a PS2 game.

The level design is also very weak and the platforming is horrible and probably should have been left out.  The camera fails to swing around so often times you are just jumping on a prayer.  Simply put it isn't fun climbing along walls, jumping from pillar to pillar etc like it is in other games.  It's more like when is this going to be over so I can shoot some people type of experience.  The arena sequences are fun but sometimes, no a lot of times, it's tough to determine how to get to some of the bonuses and swings.  It's also tough to determine where and how many ""doors"" there are to close to complete.  That part was hit or miss....some arenas were a blast while others were just a chore.  And some of the enemies could take 5 minutes of gatling gun to the chest and not die...I felt that was strange....but nothing too deterring.

Overall, the game is fun but is only worth one playthrough in my opinion.  I'd give the game a 2.5/5. Leave Rubi Alone!"
2.0	"I regret not having investigated reviews prior to buying this title via Steam..

the game is just a been done before mix-mash of countless other games. The over the shoulder
camera view of yourself is not what I like in  a FPS and quickly gets awkward and annoying.

I can't think of many FPS where the over the shoulder view really works and I wish developers
would give it a rest.. it's not like we are all playing out of body games now is it ?

If you have nothing to do and can get this title for 5$ it might be worth a look.. other than that avoid. awkward boring been done before"
2.0	Dont really care for the songs. My mistake for not really checking first. Two Stars
2.0	"These just SAY they are Hi Res, they aren't. No other sound present but lows, no mids and no highs. Comfort is meh, the leather makes you sweat and will crack eventually, these are huge headsets but the self adjust works decently  to distribute pressure.
Didnt get the versatility I wanted nor the Hi Res sound. The sound was very bad, maybe I got a lemon but based on how these look, the feel, its lack of features just not worth a retry from me.
List of SOME headphones Ive used
Sennheiser HD 480  Sennheiser PC 390  Ultrasone HFI 450 Steelseries Arctis Pro V Moda LP V Moda Crossfade Klipsch Image One Nothing to look for"
2.0	"First, AC3 feels least like Assassins Creed game. From the overly specific full synchronization mission objectives to the walk-between-cutscenes missions, the player is stripped of the sandbox style of play. The game forces you to play a predetermined style, which rids of the fun. In fact, the entire game plays out like you are more of a soldier than an Assassin.

Connor is the least strong of the AC characters and I actually found him quite annoying. The game is rather shallow in that it does not delve at all into the Creed or Brotherhood, but only that it exists and is there to stop the Templars.

The game lacks any polish. First, the game suffers from poor mechanics. Fluidity and consistency are the biggest problems. While there is the random ledge grabbing and haphazard horse controls, the combat is the biggest misstep. I use to love the combat, but in AC3 it is tiresome. The counters work like half the time. The gunplay ruins any flow. I died so many cheap deaths because of the odd mechanics. Second, there are more glitches in bugs in this game than in any other game Ive played, which is sad for a blockbuster franchise like AC.

Next, the extras do not tie into the game whatsoever. I completed the game without doing any extras. I did not find them fun and rather unnecessary unlike previous installments where I did everything. They were not explained well. Also, I did not see weapon upgrades or costume upgrades.

Other serious complaints are the rather terrible fast-travel between zones, strange menu design, and the insanely long 4 hour tutorial at the beginning of the game.

The Assassins Creed franchise is one of my favorites and AC2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I found so much disappointment and squandered potential with AC3. The perfect example of how to not make a sequel"
2.0	The core game design is repetitive. The visuals are lacking lots of browns and dull colors. The cut-scenes are nice but that's about it . Not as good as I hoped
2.0	"Borderlands (original) is the only software included in this package, along with a nice map (no other content).  2 stars because Borderlands is an excellent game, and I highly recommend it.

That said, the case advertises the inclusion of content that had been released on Xbox Live and PSN, respectively.  This appeared perfect for me, since I am not interested in locking content to my account or relying on some company's ""word"" (Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo) to provide the data 10 years from now when I want to play again and I have a totally different PS3.

In reality, the content is still only on PSN/Xbox Live and is not included in the box!  Instead, you receive one-time-use vouchers to go off on the Internet and download the content yourself.  Who's to say this ""eternal"" server will be there 15 years from now when you want to play again?  This is basically fraud.  At the very least, it's extremely lazy, terrible DRM trickery.

The Game of the Year content might be good if it were actually for ""sale"", but it's only for ""lease"" right now.  I don't buy games as a service -- that's why we all left the arcades when NES came out!

What this means is, you can't lend your copy to a friend after you play it, you can't sell your content to anyone, and you can't use this on multiple systems (aside from the token allowance of replacement systems ""given"" by Sony/Microsoft), because you don't own it.  You only actually own vanilla Borderlands.  Draconian DRM at its finest. DRM Warning: Content Not Included -- Download Only"
2.0	Its some what better then madden 96 thier is i create player feature which is fine, theirs a trade feature but trades are limited and once you hit the limit the only way undo a trade is reset the cartidge and start all over from begining which is aggrivating Madden 97
2.0	DOES NOT WORK ON PLAYSTATION 2 DOES NOT WORK ON PS2
2.0	"This is a good game for a 6 or 7 year old, but much older and you'll be bored.  I played it for a few hours with my daughter - but it got so repetitive that we haven't picked it up since.

If you can get it for $9.99 or less, I recommend it, but I wouldn't pay more for it. OK sub $10 game"
2.0	Little boring. Story playing was short Little boring
2.0	Nice basic gaming mouse, with a caveat. Includes a dpi button (to help slow down/speed up the pointer), forward/back browsing buttons, and a programmable gaming button.  The motion is very smooth and the buttons responsive.  However, this mouse stalls an awful lot.  The cursor will just freeze and sit for several seconds randomly; but it also seems to do this when I have not moved the mouse for a while (almost like it is entering sleep mode).  Unfortunately this happens frequently enough (several times per hour) where I have now switched back to my old mouse just to avoid disruptions my workflow.  Otherwise, the mouse glides very nicely and is light, which is great for fast action, but not as good for tight editing of Autocad files or pictures in Photoshop.  For the latter uses, a heavier mouse is better.  The colors on the mouse are very customizable (once your download the Windows program for it; not available for Mac).  However, programming the colors for different settings and programs is not intuitive at all and it takes time to read the 100-page user's manual to get full benefit.  But changing the default colors is easy using the Corsair program.  Overall a good gaming mouse.  The Pro version is a little better in the hand and you can adjust the weight.  This mouse is good if you have the patience and time to read the manual, and you can withstand the stalls. Responsive and smooth, but stalls too much.
2.0	While Gauntlet offers a lot of levels, mosnsters and bosses, it will get boring really fast.  It helps to have friends playing but even then it will still wear off fast.  If you don't believe me play all the way through the game, then say it's still entertaining.  You almost can't do it. Incredibly Fun... for 30 minutes.
2.0	I just didn't like this game much maybe because it's was a old game period. Two Stars
2.0	If you are not a subscriber of XBOX 360 GOLD in which you need to pay $50 or $60 per year, don't bother to purchase this item. You're required to be a subscriber to XBOX Gold
2.0	"Okay, I can understand why some people might rave about this game, because the graphics are really, really pretty and might be a bit overwhelming.  But one you start playing, I don't see how anyone could give this game an above-average (or even average) rating.  The controls for the main character are clunky, the 3-D mapping leaves a lot to be desired, and the weapons controls are pretty unimpressive.  The plot itself is uninspired, and involves the following formula: A) Walk down creepy corridor, B) Kill Event-Horizon rip-off critter, C) Emerge into a lab, D) Repeat step ""B"" multiple times, E) Move something with your mind, F) Go back to the beginning, G) Go to next level, H) Repeats previous steps.  Seriously, this is one of the most linear games I've ever seen, and I was completely bored with it after just a couple of hours. A lot of hype, not much delivery"
2.0	"Real short review.  Played Modern Warefare 1 until fingers bled.  Modern Warefare 2 is the same fast action that made me hate Team Fortress 2.  It's just a bunch of craziness.  You can never set up any type of coordinated play. Just run and gun.  It's crap.

Edit:  Will be reinstalling Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and uninstalling this piece of crap. Single Player lased 6 hours: Multiplayer sucks"
2.0	Every once and a while I have to pull the headset dongle out and plug it back in to the USB slots on this stand. it seems to go it with no tracable reason. The Sony Stand has little nobs that hold the PS4 to the base but this does not. the PS4 can still be knocked over with ease. Try something else
2.0	"It only works when I have my DS off or suspended. It won't charge when turned on. While this isn't bad as it is, it is not what I expected.
The item description/documentation was not good enough. Won't charge unless New 3DS is off or suspended"
2.0	At times the reviews of others lead you astray. This is one of those times. This is a game the appears and plays like a PSP game. It does not take advantage of the PS Vita's amazing capabilities. For a PSP game I would give it 4 stars for a vita game its 2. hmmmmm........
2.0	I enjoyed playing the game, it gave me a few hours of entertainment. However, the controls and the camera angles are just horrific... I would recommend either playing this in complete dark with the sound on ear piercing just for a few kicks or buy something else. Decent story, horrible controls
2.0	Thrust has a design problem and they admit it. The main reason I bought it was the supposed quality of parts used to build. The outside plastic has rough seems on them and are very noticeable. The CH manager is gerat program works flawlessly for anything I have asked to do no problem there. The mini stick is were the known design flaw is and no amount of a dead zone fixes it. The y orientation of the stick is on spring and only centers properly if you let it snap back or with a minor manual adjustment after slowly releasing it to center again. the spring does not do its job properly. Any customer service request will result in the company giving you a much more technical breakdown as to why the stick you have is operating properly. I have roll assign to it ( no pedals $$ atm ) if do a slow roll when I let off slowly or gently it continues to roll. This is a major annoyance and has only become more of annoyance now after I learned it is designed that way and it is passed my return period. Thrust has a design problem, just by resting hand ...
2.0	Every time i start the game to continue, you have to go through the stupid tutorial every time. getting a hold of origin is another matter. its like they don't want to hear from you. i've been trying over and over for weeks now, with no results. how do you get a hold of those guys. i love sim city but not this way, it isn't worth it. lots of luck
2.0	felt like a shell game, and disappointing. I hope this is not the modal for the future of gaming.. I'm sure after all the pieces of the game are put back together and its all playable it will be an amazing game.. felt like a shell game
2.0	I was very disappointed to find that this didn't even come with a video game case or a booklet. I bought this for my boyfriend for xmas. It arrived later than the estimated date and wasn't quite what i was expecting to get. I had to give two stars because the game wasn't scratched and plays okay (except for the glitch in the game that won't allow him to proceed) didn't even come with an actual case. Disappointed
2.0	"I guess it's safe to say that the Mario Party series as we knew it...is over. After a pretty lame Mario Party 8 and the disastrous Mario Party 9, both for Wii, the first game in the series for Wii U is no better. This just isn't the Mario Party that we grew up playing with friends and having such a great time. I remember playing Mario Party 6 for hours and stll not wanting to stop. This is a dumbed down, childish, and flat out BORING replacement for those earlier games.

Bowser Mode: The biggest addition is Bowser mode, where one player plays against up to another 4. While the mode isn't a total loss, there are no normal mini games, just Bowser party games...and there are only 10. So it does get repetitive. Also, the only person having any new experience with the game is the person playing as Bowser! Good luck giving all your friends a chance at the gamepad, everyone will play once and be uninterested afterwards. It's just not that fun.  Much like the regular party mode, mini games are often too infrequent. You also cannot play Bowser mode on every board, only select boards.

 Amiibo Mode: A total waste of time and cash grab for Nintendo. This mode is supposed to be modeled after the old Mario Parties...except is has little to do with any of them other than the rules. The boards are small, perfectly square, and completely boring. There is nothing interesting about this mode and it definitely gives you the sense that it only serves the purpose of getting more people to purchase Amiibos, which have yet to prove any real significance for the Wii U. But, who is surprised? Nintendo has become the king of gimmicks, flashy advertising, and unbelievably poor delivery.

 Mario Party Mode: This is basically an HD version of Mario Party 9. The boards are a little more interesting and interactive...but not enough to even really acknowledge it and the majority of the themes are the same that have been used over and over again. MIni games are infrequent, yet again, but have hardly any effect anyway. The boss battles are overly simplified, and have little impact on anything, since the entire game is nearly 100% luck based from the second it starts. Then there is the car. The bloody car. The car is so stupid. We all know it. Anyone who has loved the series knows it. People complained about Mario Party 9  and it's terrible mechanics, including all players moving together....so Nintendo has repaid us by making the exact same game over again! I guess they really don't care what people want. They will cater every idea to a six year old.

Bonus Games: Nothing significant. Some small other games that take a few minutes to play and provide minimal amusement. Badminton is the best of the bunch, but hardly a true game, it feels very much like every other mini game.

 Overall, the game is just too dull for practically anyone over the age of 12. It's too luck based, requires no skill, no thinking, no strategy, and frankly...offers next to no fun other than a random moment here or there. I loved Mario Party for a long time. I remember getting the very first game! Regardless, I'm done now.  I will never purchase another game in the series. I was hoping Nintendo would redeem themselves on their new console from the lousy Wii releases of the series. I was so wrong. This is every mistake, repackage in pretty HD paper. It's not worth it. They are using the Mario Party name to sell games, while putting in minimal effort. Mario Party 10 is a true slap in the face. AVOID. The death of Mario Party."
2.0	"I am a father who grew up plaing video games and have owned multiple systems both console and portable. Based on other reviews I read, and the fact that I like Garfield and platform games, I was really excited to give this one a try. Unfortunately my thoughts quickly changed when I started actually playing it.

For a DS game, I thought the graphics were very good. They are colorful and seem much more detailed than many of the other DS titles I've played. In ways that is really good (for this title) but also somewhat depressing considering the level of graphics so many other DS titles COULD have achieved.

This game seems in many ways like it's meant for a younger audience. There are many arrows that direct you to where you need to go and the mini-games seemed very simple in concept (jump on the spiders, or jump on the garbage cans, avoid the bombs that come out and get an extra life). But that's where the irony comes in. For a game that seemed targeted towards younger game players, I thought the difficulty level was pretty high at times. The thing is, the difficulty isn't in areas you would expect but rather the outrageous number of cheap shots you take from enemies/dangers that move/fly/crawl/spring up or shoot you from out of nowhere, many of which you simply don't see until you take a half-blind leap onto a nearby platform, fall from a ledge, or jump somewhere trying to avoid another danger. I was really amazed at the number of cheap shots I was taking as I moved through levels. Whether it was a spiked bomb that suddenly appeared from offscreen as I jumped to reach a ledge, or a snowball that got thrown at me as I was trying to figure out the pattern of a danger I needed to avoid, or an unseen spike that shot up from the ground on a platform I had to jump to. At times it felt like someone meticulously calculated how best to take away hit points and lives for the player, knowing they would jump here to avoid something flying at you and purposely putting something else dangerous there that would be right in sync timewise to hurt you. Throughout the game I constantly felt like I never had enough hit points or lives and was forced to start some whole worlds over repeatedly. I'm starting to wonder if this is simply how this game was designed as a way to try and build in longer playing time for anyone who wants to complete it.

Sadly, some of my biggest frustration seemed to come in during the ""bonus"" levels. You know...the levels that are really hard to find and usually require you to sacrifice a lot of hit points (and lives) to reach because the paths to them are full of danger and enemies. I realized over time that part of the reason I was having to re-play whole lands over again (due to losing all my lives) was this cheap shot mentality that even carried over into the ""bonus rounds"". Without the bonus rounds to rack up extra lives, you have to survive 5 levels (including a boss) with only 3 lives (basicallt 9 hit points). I suppose this is easy enough if you want to go very slowly through the game and sit and wait on every platform ready to jump, because you don't know what might suddenly appear around you from off screen. I was amazed at the number of times I reached a bonus round though, my character appeared on screen, and before I could even move was touched by a spider or something and was instantly killed. So much for the bonus round, the lives/hit points I lost trying to reach it etc... Thus I was actually worse off overall by trying to reach the bonus round than if I had just skipped it altogether.

The real problem with this entire game is that the visual space is simply way too cramped. It makes for a nice large and pretty Garfield, but it also means you are constantly blindsided by things you can't see because the field of vision is way too narrow. I also thought the hit detection on many of the enemies was very poor. Whether jumping on ghosts, birds, snowmen, etc...I was amazed at the number of times I should have defeated an enemy but instead somehow lost one of my few hit points or even lives because jumping on their head wasn't good enough. It was aas if I needed to pinpiont land on one specific pixel that the game randomly decided for each enemy and had apparently chosen the wrong one this time. It was grossly inconsistent and left me scratching my head. In the end I thought the game overall was highly restrictive and punishing in this regard, having an extremely difficult challenge that made you just want to skip trying to jump on enemies after awhile and forget the coins you could have had from destroying them. The funny thing was, I didn't realize until the end that you don't get anything for all the coins you collect. You just need a certain number to open the bonus round doors, but I think the highest number of coins ever needed was 30 or 35, and you can commonly pick up that many just laying around in each level, so there really was no point to ever take on any of the enemies (at least for their coins anyhow).

I really like platform games and have played through many of them on various systems. I have experienced many that were challenging, but Garfields Nightmare turned out to simply be a nightmare in cheap shot gameplay. In the end, my time with this game was more frustration that enjoyment and I would not recommend this game to anyone.

I reached the final boss at about 6 hours of gameplay time and lost 5 lives trying to defeat him. After losing my last life and being told I would have to play the entire world (all five levels) all over again I decided I was simply done with this one. Garfield's Nightmare"
2.0	"I'll start out by saying that I firmly believe that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Intellimouse-Explorer/dp/B00013VHAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer</a>&nbsp;is one of the best mice ever made. I've also particularly liked the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-MX-510/dp/B0001YGIB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech MX 510</a>&nbsp;mouse, as well.

So, I have a pretty good idea of what a $50 mouse (give or take) should be... and it isn't the SideWinder X5.

It's been a while since I've used a mouse that felt so cheap. The X5 is really, REALLY light, but not in a ""Gee, how did they make it so light?"" way. It's light in a ""Did this come free with the purchase of two spindles of blank CD's?"" way.

The ergonomics are simply awful. The raise of the mouse should be a little higher, and there's a strange ring finger rest that just feels awkward. The thumb buttons are incredibly easy to hit (unintentionally), and short of accuracy -- which is excellent, and the only reason I didn't give the X5 one star -- almost everything else about this mouse is wrong, wrong, wrong.

If you're looking for a new gaming mouse in this price range, I'd give the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-MX-400-Performance-Laser-Mouse/dp/B000F1O0X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech MX 400 Performance Laser Mouse</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G5-Laser-Mouse/dp/B000ODN7VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G5 Laser Mouse</a>&nbsp;a serious look. Or, hold off on buying a mouse and hope Microsoft updates this with something better. Feels way too cheap for what it costs."
2.0	"My daughter just received this game for her 4th birthday along with her very own DS. She seemed to have fun with it but after less than 1 day she came to me and said she got through the game and saved the mermaid. I thought that there is no way she could have gotten through the game in less than 1 hour. I went and checked through the game and the instructions to find out what other things or levels there were to play to find out that there were no other things to do. I am completely appauled by how little this game has to offer. It probably took 1 week for the developers to put this game together, slap the Dora name on it and send it out for parents to get for there children thinking that there children will get a great learning experience that will last for a few months or at least a few weeks. Not 1 hour. !!
I would definitely not recommend buying this game. It should be included free in a box of cereal. Unbelievably short and easy!!"
2.0	Still the same great ps3. I gave it a 2 stars because this model is the cheap made feel like a cheap toy that can break fast. I also don't like the top load because it can get dust inside easily. The top load make it the disk spin louder than the previous model the original slim. Im reselling this to get the original slim that I had for 5 years and it was still working just find until I drop it on the ground while packing and moving stuff to my new house. Bottom line is get the original slim it look better and build better. cheap made and top load feel like it can break easily
2.0	"Pros:
You can type on a fastest way that using the joystick.

Cons:
Small buttons (You will find yourself pressing accidentally other keys)
""Touchpad"" very imprecise
Will make you control heavier
Only practical if You use to chat on the PS3, totally useless with day-to-day use (average gaming) Useless artifact"
2.0	This game is ok if your looking for a shooter on the cube, but there were much better later Recon games and other shooters that came out later. Get metal gear for the cube instead. You get a much better game that is also collectible. Better options abound
2.0	"When I got this game I was so happy, I brought the special edition which is a def must have if you got the money. But back to the game itself I was completely disappointed with this game, the graphics are great a little not for me but still great. To look at everything is so life like you will be amaze on how detail everything is and living in new york myself I love that rockstar did their research on each part of liberty city to compare with new york city because of what you experience in the game is also what you most likely experience in new york. Also liberty city is massive in gta4 its so big it kind of annoying going to places that are so far that it might take you about 5 minutes just to reach a mission.

  I got mostly bad things to say about this game so please bare with me. To start off the music in gta4 sucks big time I means every song that they pick out is so boring and not catchy at all. Almost all the artist and their songs I do not recognize at all and whats sad is that all the stations are the same with boring music and not so funny jokes. So to be honest when I'm driving the music is always turn off which makes me mad cause I love the soundtracks they usually put in GTA but this time they fail and having it put off while driving sucks. Next is the driving its so bad its not even funny when you start driving you tell yourself ""oh this is bad but maybe I'll get use to it"", but I promise you that will never happen. The cars themselves always kinda look the same as well as drive the same which sucks cause if you want a fast car that's not going to happen and turning in sharp corners is hell making races stupid and not fun at all. I can't tell you  how many times I cuss at the tv and threw my X-box remote on the floor just cause I could not turn my car around the corner and I end up crashing into someone else or end up in the water and repeating the damn mission from the start and take ten to 15 minutes just to drive and get the mission done and pray I don't crash again.

  Another thing I hate is the story line its the worst one in the series its makes no sense and is boring as hell, missions are the same shoot, kill and drive which is fine because the shooting system is great and very fun ,the acting is great also, not one bad actor to be found. At the end of the day I stop playing the game all together because of the bad driving the story is boring and music is terrible,I'll finish it but only because of the achievements and that's it do yourself a flavor and skip it. Get china town wars for ds or psp its fun as hell and won't make you throw your remote on the floor. Not good, not good at all."
2.0	"I'm rating this from the perspective of a gamer. To map the buttons, at least for my use, you need the use the Logitech Gaming Software. The problem with that is the fact that the software fails about 30% of the time. I'll start my game, hit one of the mapped buttons and find that it hadn't loaded my game's profile and was using the default, which results in the loss of some precious in-game consumable. (Gamers will get this)

Normally and aggravatingly it causes me to have to exit the game, kill the process and restart the software. (Steam users will get the agony of Steam's need to sync EVERYTHING which take several minutes) Once I restart, it's about 50/50 if it's going to work. If it doesn't, then it's a matter of repeat until it works.

That's what prompted me to write this, as I went through this process five times when all I want to do is play a freakin' game. Seriously, if I wanted to stress, I would have stayed at work!

Now as strictly a stand alone product, it is a great mouse. Very sturdy, very responsive and, as they say, no lag wireless. I do, however take issue with the claim of up to 250 continuous hours of battery life. I get maybe 90-100 before I have to replace the batteries.

Because it is tied to the software, however, it eliminates a large portion of the device's capability. I would happily pay half the cost of this mouse for one just like it without programmable buttons, but not this price point for a device that may or may not operate as advertised.

I am a HUGE Logitech fan. They have been my go to source for peripherals for many years, but this is a great letdown. As a mouse, it's a four star product without regard to the price. I agonized over a two or three star rating, then considered how I would rate an automobile that would only start 70% of the time and would randomly quit while cruising down the road. Being tied to the software to fully utilize the capability of this mouse with that high a failure rate drags it down to a two. The concept is great; the implementation... not so much"
2.0	Got sea sick playing. Game got boring fast Game got boring
2.0	Nothing special, it seems like mainly eye candy. Didn't play beyond an hour
2.0	Tedious. Bleh.
2.0	"The single player game is not bad when you play on the hardest difficulties but several aspects of the game seem broken. The biggest problem with the game is the other marines accompanying you. They will run ahead of you and while catch up you will be ambushed by aliens or mercenaries which doesn't end well 9 out 10 times. Also they will often stand there and not shoot at anything. When they do shoot at something it seems like they shoot blanks because no enemies die or they shoot at a wall with nothing there. The story makes no sense as how/why is not explained. ""Oh well that's a long story"" is the response given. The motion tracker is useless! It's only use it to find the direction of your objective if you get lost after a battle. The infamous smart gun has about 10 minutes of playtime in the game. It is by far the best/coolest weapon in the game but there's only 3 you can find. 1 of your fellow marines gets it for most of the game and is ineffective with it. I wished I could shoot him and take it from him because he sucks! Many of the levels are outside in the open making the broken alien AI no challenge at all. They just stupidly run at you while you gun them down from a distance. No playable levels as an alien. I could go on and on but I've had enough already.

The multiplayer saved my review from a 1 star but it gets old pretty fast. Bottom line don't purchase this game until it hits the bargain bin. Bad game."
2.0	"It's kind of getting to the point where you have to ask, when will enough be enough with the Guitar Hero series? The first two GH games were incredibly fun, you could play with friends and family, and laugh and have a ball while you tried to make it through the songs. You didn't have to be musically inclined or even a video game expert to play Guitar Hero, you just had to enjoy music.

Then, you had GH3 which cranked up the difficulty and alienated some of the hardcore yet casual fans. The focus seemed to be geared towards mastering the plastic guitar controller. Some songs, I couldn't complete on the ""hard"" level and bombed out after the first 30 seconds.

The iterations following GH3 have had many improvements, culminating with the excellent GH Metallica.

Despite seeing that many songs/artists on GH5 were not any that I've heard of before, cared for, and didn't belong on a GUITAR HERO game (Coldplay??), I bought it mainly for what I thought would be an awesome Guitar Hero Van Halen (SORELY mistaken!). I am trading in GH5 now while there is still some trade-in value left. The game is OK, but really, aside from the songs and unlockables, plus the ability to use your XBox Live Avatar as a playable character, there is nothing new about this game.

Guitar Hero should be about power-chord, feel-good songs like ""Working For The Weekend"" from Loverboy (how about ""Hot Girls In Love""?), but they tried to go with the mainstream here, and I think it sucked, much like today's music sucks.

Some of the songs from popular musicians are OK to play. Figured I'd give it a try, but honestly, if you paid full price for this game, you paid too much.

I think when GH6 eventually comes out, I will do what seems to be the trend with these games, and wait until they hit the bargain or clearance bin at Target and pay about 1/5 the price. The series is getting old and stale. Getting stale"
2.0	"I was a little miffed I even needed to get this because I already had a universal remote (Harmony).

This remote works as advertised but the layout is less than stellar and they tried to map every single PS3 control button to the remote, so it's laden with buttons.

Also, you have to treat the remote just like one of the controllers and use the PS button to turn it on/off. Honestly, I think this is just an elongated PS3 controller.

The other issue is that when you  haven't used the remote for a bit and it goes to sleep, and then you issue a button press like Pause or Stop, you have to do it twice, because the first time the button press won't do anything except wake the remote up, then the second button press will actually work.

The obnoxious part about the remote is that it has *no* indicators of any kind on it. So you can't tell if it's on, off, asleep, synced or out of batteries. You just use it and if you push a button 3 or more times and it doesn't do anything, it's safe to assume it's dead.

A simple LED on the top would have done the trick, but then they wouldn't be able to keep the $29 margin of profit they make on this piece of hardware.

Overall it's a poor remote, some ""throw in"" you would expect with a normal TV and overly unacceptable as a remote for a nice TV (not even backlit).

But it's the only way to control movies on the PS3 without using the controller, so if you need it, I guess you are going to buy it. Poor/Simple Design, Cluttered, but Works"
2.0	"No, actually you and I are very different. I should wonder why Vicarious Visions would let out a game like this! The game is so unfinished. My goodness! The graphics in the game are pretty well done untill you get a closer look at it, then the horrible truth comes out. Don't get me wrong, there are some strong points in this game and theres a whole lot more of down points. The really strong point in this game is the sound. The sound actually almost sounds as if it came from the console versions. But further down the road things just get ugly. The qoutes in the game really are stupid. Like, ""You may have destoryed my robots, Spider-Man. But you'll never defeat me!"" things like that are really stupid! You got to hand it to these guys, they use the most overly used and abused sayings in the book. I personally feel that there was alot more potential in this game. There again developers are getting lazy and lazyer by the moment. I think the key thing wrong with games today is they lack imagination and that's one of the unique things God created in us! So that's my reveiw. Remember "" Be a customer. Not a consumer! Period.""- Jake Smithers ""Your a unique creature, Spider-Man. You and I are not so different.""- Green Goblin"
2.0	"Back in 1993 Sega released a dull, lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time. Quickly realizing their mistake they hashed out a different version of the game, claiming it would be bigger, tougher and better.
It isn't. It's a slow, boring game.
You can choose to be either Dr. Alan Grant or...a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why would Dr. Grant go around killing all those army guys (just what are they doing in the game)? And why a Raptor be killing other Raptors? Weird.
Obviously not learning from their first mistake Sega really dropped the ball on this so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, sluggish and dullest platformers I have ever played. Bo-oring!"
2.0	"I have played every version of EA golf games going back to the PS1.  This is the most disappointed I've been in any of the games.  The gameplay is just OK, but it feels sluggish and unfinished.
As far as no load screens, well that's kind of true.  While there may be no load screens, it moves slow between shots.  In fact, it moves very slow when trying to set up your shot or select clubs.
It's very limited when creating your character.  There is very little customization - everything is very generic.  Every character is very strange looking.
12 courses for $60, really?  1 is a map from BF4.  It is nice to see Coyote Canyon return after so many years.
If you go through the Prologue be prepared for it to take 20 minutes.
The graphics are not great for the Xbox One especially when compared to Forza 5 or Horizon (I know they're different types of games).

I'm going to keep playing it to see if it gets better.  EA had better reward us with some free courses since, overall, this game is not that good at this time. Poor Next Gen Effort from EA"

2.0	"This is my second pair of Turtle Beach headphones, and the second one to break in exactly the same way.  The plastic swivel connectors on the cups (which seem unnecessary anyway) simply do not hold up under regular use.  They last about a year, and then one of them snaps, leaving the cup dangling and the headphones useless.

I have no complaint with the sound from these headphones -- the quality is good.  I have some trouble getting them to always work right with Windows 7, because they incorporate both a headphone and speaker component, the combination of which sends Microsoft's sound software into a tailspin, but that's hardly the fault of Turtle Beach.  Any problems are generally quickly resolved.

If you're going to purchase these headphones, I recommend doing so from an outlet that will give you a two-year replacement policy.  Trust me, it will be money well spent.  Alternately, opt for Tritton or Razer products, which I understand have greater durability (Razer seems to manufacture the moving parts of most of their headsets from metal, which seems like a good plan).  For my part, Turtle Beach products have just proven too disposable for me to ever purchase them again.

EDIT: In the process of packing my PX22s up for return today, I discovered that they had also broken on the other side, the headband slide cracking in the fashion to which some other reviewers have called attention.  The swivel on the other side was also showing the white signs of plastic stress.

Upon returning the headphones, the Customer Service rep applauded me on maintaining these headphones for so long, stating that he sees customers returning Turtle Beach headsets with structural damage as few as two weeks after purchasing them.

2.0	"That was my screeming little girl voice you heard the other night after playing this game. I was excited to see a fight club game coming out! I wanted this to be at least an ok game. Here's whats what. The story mode is too short. The ""make your own fighter"" is extreemly limited. Control is a bit off. They put a nice dent in the movie making this. I hope Chuck P. (The guy that wrote the book befor it was a movie) urinates all over this in a public place for everyone to see. I don't know if he actually cares if this was a failure, so I think I'll take this to a public place and do my thing on it for him. Read the book. Watch the movie. Skip the painful game. WHYeeeeeeeeee!?!"

CONs:
Frustrating angles
Tedious and repetitive gameplay
Beaver Bother (you know what I'm talking about if you've played this game)

I had always heard how DK64 was such a classic, and so naturally I wanted to finally buy and beat it.

Instead of a classic, I found a game that was, well, kind of lazy. You essentially have 7 levels before the boss level, and you have to beat each of these levels with 5 different characters. So, you have to spend your time getting all of DK's bananas and missing the other 4 characters' bananas, because only Diddy can get Diddy bananas, only Tiny can get Tiny coins, etc. This means you have to basically go back and re-do the whole level with another character all over again.

Couple this with the fact that camera angles are constantly changing on you, it makes for a very ho-hum experience.

At one point during the 30 hours it took me to beat this game, I turned on the game and found all my data was erased. At first I was angry, but then kind of relieved that I didn't have to feel like I needed to finish this game anymore. That's saying a lot, because I always finish games I start. (I turned the game on-and-off again, and the data was there again, so I did finish playing it. But the point still stands: I WANTED my data to be erased.) Tedious, Frustrating, not the Classic I was led to believe"
2.0	"I bought Fallout 3 for the PC because it received glowing reviews on [...], as did its predecessor, Fallout 2.  I totally missed the boat on that one, so I rolled up my sleeves with enthusiasm and got full swing into Fallout 3.

Unfortunately, this should go down as a classic example of a video game that, while it has an easy interface and superb graphics, is simply no fun to play.  At least, not for me.

I grew up in the American southwest, so walking over a blasted desert is to me certainly not romantic or fun:  I did a lot of that growing up.  Just walking through the sun shooting the occasional stray dog or giant cockroach?  Boring!

Maybe somebody from north of the Arctic circle would find this game interesting, but I don't.  I basically looks like you're walking through any depressed town in southern Arizona.

As for the gamemaker's arranging it so that you can run around and have your own adventure (and ignore the main quest of finding your father, etc.), that kind of freedom has worked well in the Grand Theft Auto series, mainly because you can disport yourself by driving around in stolen Ferraris.

But in this game, you freedom consists of the ability to stumble over broken rocks, through dried vegetation, and across cracked asphalt -- all the while under a blazing sun.

Heck.  I don't require a video game for that. lovingly crafted, but boring"
2.0	out of date. Two Stars
2.0	Myst.  The title alone will bring you memories of joy or pure frustration if you were around when the game originally hit PC's years ago.  Since then, there have been numerous sequels and spin-off's, with the original Myst being ported to countless systems as well.  Now, all these years later, Myst comes to the DS for some odd reason.  One may think that the game may be reconfigured and really put the DS' technical capabilities to use, but alas, it doesn't.  What we get here is the same game of yesteryear, with the only difference being that Myst has not aged well at all.  The once pretty still visuals have become dated and stale, and the fact that the game has been cropped and shrunk down makes things harder to see than ever before.  Not to mention that the point and click style of gameplay, which would seem to be something that work on the DS, just seem less interactive than before.  Myst as a whole is still a chore to get through as well, but those who enjoyed the game back in the day will find that most of the original's audio quality is here, and there is a bonus island to play as well.  Whether or not you get that far however is another question entirely.  All in all, if you enjoyed Myst way back when and you own a DS, this may be worth a look; but for those uninitiated with the Myst series or the old point and clicker genre, avoid like the plague. Some things just never change
2.0	"My son and I have been playing video games together since he was an infant and used to sit on my lap behind the steering wheel to beep the horn or push various buttons while I raced. We had a lot of fun playing Midnight Club and Need for Speed. Honest to God, once when he was about 3 and we were racing, he said, ""Mom, do you have a pair of scissors?"" I said, ""Huh?!"" Then he chortled and said, ""Because I'm going to cut you off!"" and he did!!!

So, when I purchased this, my hope was that we could again enjoy playing ""Need for Speed"" together, as in one as the cop, one as the criminal, race via split screen. Nope. This doesn't support split screen or co-op play.

It doesn't seem to connect via a normal Xbox Live account either, but requires a specific/separate EA Games account (which, whenever you start the game you're prompted for and have to skip if you don't).

Beyond that, as just a one player racing game, it's still pretty fun. The courses and objectives are challenging and even in just the first sector which we've unlocked, there are about 10 different courses, each with a subsection of various missions.

It works extremely well with a force feedback steering wheel (surprising that all racing games don't?).

As a racing game by itself, it's really good, but I sincerely miss having the split-screen option since I still love playing video games along side my son and don't intend to buy another Xbox and Xbox live account to sit in another room just to play together (defeats the purpose, no?). Not 2 player, needs it's own EA Games account????"
2.0	"Man I wanted to like this game. I looked like some sort of F-Zero ripoff, and that was a good game. Right?!?!? Well this game falls short. The touchy and unresponsive controls are where the problem lies. The tutorials are confusing to say the least. The graphics are the only thing that saves this 'dog' of a game!

Controls: D+
Graphics: B
Music/Sound: D
Overall Fun:D+ Ugh these controls blow"
2.0	I got this game  a week ago.  When I first saw this game I thought I was going to like it.  When I popped the c.d in the playstation It was so darn frustrating to control croc.  I only went to the dessert world.  When I was in the ice world I kept losing cuz u go a long way just to get a key to save a freakin gobbo.  Croc for game boy color is much better than the one for playstation.  If u r looking for a really good cute, funny, fun, interesting game get Gex: Enter the gecko.  What I am tring to tell u is that DON'T GET THIS GAME EVER. I really hate this game
2.0	Not really a fan of these types of games but if you like MMORPG and elder scrolls, then this is the game for you. Mmorpg
2.0	"Geez. I feel bad for all the people on here who spent +$30 bucks when this thing first came out.  There are a myriad of XBOX 360 games that come out that you never hear about or even care to try, until you find them used for less than $10 bucks (or in this case, less than $5!).  So, for the money I spent on this game - I think it's just great.  Sure, it's just another 3rd person shooter thing that plays similar to Gears of War, but is that a bad thing?  I think it's just great!
The graphics are good, but muddled.  They are colorful and well made, but kind of, muddled?  I don't know how to put it.  It LOOKS like a first-gen game on the 360, I guess.  It's no slouch, though - there are no glitches or pixely areas.  It's plenty nice to look at.
The controls are OK - takes a little getting used to but overall it's no different than many others out there.
Gameplay is repetitive, but you know, I like it.  Sometimes I just wanna shoot stuff and clear levels!
For what I paid for it, I think it's excellent.  As a game on it's own, sure it doesn't hold up, but it's still plenty of fun!

** UPDATE **
I got to a point in this game where you have to defeat wave upon wave of enemies.  Even on EASY, I couldn't do it.  I tried again and again and eventually gave up.  I just stopped playing and moved on to another game.  So, I wouldn't recommend this game!!! For $4 bucks, ya can't beat it! - but I stopped playing"
2.0	"I was hesitant to buy this memory card because of the inconsistent reviews of ""my carrying case"" memory cards, but this thing is working perfectly. Saves and Loads games with no problem. Sony made a fortune with their puny 8MB cards. This is the exact same dimensions, and it holds 128MB. It seems they ran out soon after I bought mine. Sorry! I would definitely recommend this company and their memory cards based on the price and mine working perfectly with every game I've played so far. I'll update this review if the status of my card changes.

*UPDATE*
Stopped working after a couple months of use. Sorry for the long delay in updating my review :^\ Does what it says so far."
2.0	Wasn't really happy with theses they really don't have anything to protect the Wii remotes. Two Stars
2.0	"As an avid fan, this is a disappointment. EA is somehow milking our wallets just because we like the franchise and they knew this well in advance.
Spectacular graphics and great sound are not all in a game even if this one delivers these in spades.

After playing for several days already, as more people have unlocked stuff, this game has just degenerated into grenade and rocket spam. That and the awful spawns are making me not even want to play anymore.

Star Wars Battlefront is the greatest video rental I could ever recommend to a fan of the franchise. As I said it's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played in my life, and my overall love for the franchise makes me appreciate that so much more. At the same time, it's also one of the most hollow AAA experiences I've ever played, especially when games like Titanfall, Battlefield, Call of Duty and Evolve offer so much more in terms of longer lasting gameplay and overall incentive to keep playing. The obvious lack of Chewbacca, Yoda and other classic Star Wars content makes it obvious that we'll see them in the game's inevitable expansions, but for $50, that's a hefty price to pay and I won't do it. The main menu constantly reminds you that you haven't purchased the Season Pass, but it also reminds me how shallow Battlefront is compared to modern FPS titles. Once the Jedi Mind Trick of nostalgia and Star Wars love wears off, you'll realize there are plenty of better multiplayer shooters out there that aren't as far, far away. Utterly dissapointed"
2.0	"it lags a lot in graphics. the gameplay is neither good. interesting if you want to know more about the Star Wars stories from Episodes I, II, IV, V, & VI.
i'd suggest to wait for the new RTS ""Star Wars Empire at War"" coming in 2005 made by the creators of ""Command & Conquer Generals"" (i'm not talking about publisher EA or Electronic Arts, i'm talking about the once Westwood Studios' programmers) game out in 2001-2002, still the graphics are horrible"
2.0	"Maybe I just got a bad batch or something, but it literally died a few days after using it. It could be because it's pretty cheaply made? It's 2 stars for me because the time it did work it did what it was supposed to, but I would prefer a little more quality to the casing of it instead of plastic. I think the pricing is a bit high for something like this when there's better Homebrew backup tools out there, which by the way, are free (through 3DS).

You also have to go through this convoluted process to get it working by installing unassigned drivers along with disabling driver signature enforcement on startup on your computer, or a similar method. This is to make sure your computer recognizes it because it's a USB device with not an official driver that supports it since it's a small company. It's not that big of a deal, but just want to throw it out there that the setup does take a bit of time and research. I would say purchase at your own risk. Maybe I just got a bad batch or something"
2.0	I had this keyboard a while back. The design is cool, the lights and cyborg mode are beautiful, but its just so poorly made. While it works/worked great for others, I cannot say the same. The software is absolute garbage, and I had to fight with my machine to get it to install the driver for it, and after 3 days the entire touch pad part on top just stopped working. Such a cool keyboard should not be so cheaply made. I would easily be willing to spend $150-200 if it was mechanical with a better build, easy software to use, and the touch stuff wasn't so faulty. Eh. I'm assuming the bad batch runs high in this keyboard
2.0	"Some flaws and bad graphics for a $29.99 game when it should be in the $15 to $20 range. With owning the PS4 system, I expect the graphics and game play to be flawless, or as close to it as possible. I think the porting from the PC version to the next gen systems was a bad idea. The decent 2D choppy graphics weren't very good, the zombies weren't very good, and having the game lag a few seconds, whether you are playing online or not is unacceptable for me. I understand when I play online, that I do expect a delay once in awhile. And the movement went slow, I wasn't able to run, or even walk fast. Plus your choice of people to play as wasn't good either. Same type of person, just different clothing. I do love the fact that the game was more involved, by building things and your house, but I just couldn't get over everything else. So off to the store I went to return it.
At least with the older Resident Evil games, they have much better graphics, and you can get them at a more reasonable price. Pricey for not so great game"
2.0	The Souls franchise branches off to make a new game...another souls game with different weapons and enemies. The mechanics are the same; You attack and dodge, though, you are supposed to be more aggressive in this game. I'm not a fan of it since, to me, you get stuck in the attack animation, causing you to be unable to dodge, and the audio as a strange echo that just got agitating after a while. Fans of the Souls games seem to enjoy it, but it's not my cup of blood. 10/10 - too much blood.
2.0	There's only one thing that keeps you playing and it's the fact that you are the star of movie that you won't see what happens unless you finish the game.  Let me explain.  There are sooooo many cut scenes that lead to you doing several menial tasks and a few fun shootouts but this game doesn't give you anything to do outside the storyline.  This makes the game seem very boring  There is lots of driving which sucks when you could be doing something more exiting.  You never climb the mafia ranks nor are you given the opportunity to do so.  Also, get read to repeat certain segments of a chapter over and over again if you get killed or fail a mission.  You will be disappointed with the end of the story and won't be sure at first if the game is over until the credits start rolling.  I was going to rate this as OK but after writing this and realized how much time I wasted playing it only to be disappointed with the ending I have dropped my rating from 3 stars to 2. Be prepared to be disappointed!!!
2.0	"Yes, I went out and bought this new TR installment, and I have to admit that it isn't that great.  Although titled TR: The Lost Artifact, it is in fact the equivalent of TRIII Gold; however, since this installment doesn't include the original TRIII levels, Eidos has simply marketed this offering as an expansion pack to the TR series.
The choice not to  release TLA as part of the Gold series is a flaw, to be honest.  New gamers  who are perhaps unfamiliar with the TR series are forced to purchase BOTH  TRIII and TLA.  For gamers familiar with TR, there is (as of yet) no rebate  offer available to owners of TRIII and rumors abound that the TLA levels  will not be available for future free download (such as with TR Gold).  Put  simply, Eidos's marketing strategy for TLA is awful strange.
All this  would be moot, of course, if TLA was a blast to play.  Sadly, however, it  has the feel of leftover levels rather than new crucial levels.  I had no  problems completing this game.  I was never once stumped by any of the  puzzles.  In truth, I finished the six levels in breathtaking time.  I  admit, however, that I did a pathetic job at finding all the secrets.  So,  possibly, I may have missed some treasured gameplaying nuggets.  Secrets  aside, though, the levels should still be fun, challenging, and involving.  A classic TR level, with challenging puzzles, should take HOURS to  complete.  None of the levels in TLA took me more than a single hour.
So,  unless your a TR fanatic, I'd stay away from this one.  Or I'd at least  wait until the price dramatically drops. Just Okay"
2.0	This was so disappointing. The combat isn't too bad and is actually pretty fun but unfortunately the game tries too hard at being funny and weird, which hurts the overall gameplay. It adds these weird shoot em up segments that are really slow and annoying and don't make sense in a game like this. I actually stopped at one of those segments because I just gave up trying to give it a chance. I wanted to enjoy this game but everything about it just felt mediocre and it never really focused on being a horror survival game or just a plain shooter. It was suda 51 being suda 51, but just not as good. Sorely mediocre
2.0	"If you're dead set on this mouse BUY THE OPTICAL
I have owned this mouse just shy of three years and everything has held up great. Decent comfort for Hand size 21cm x 11cm. It's size allows you to palm but there are some contour lines they should have made less pronounced to make it more comfortable.

Pro's
The buttons and scroll wheel, They are great, scrolling up and down is nice and fast, the click travel/feel is great on all the buttons. DPI up/down, the mouse wheel having three clicks on it(down,left, and right click). Software allows remapping buttons. +1 star

Cons
Horrible laser, It's just not responsive, the mouse keeps moving even though your hand stopped. Getting on target in FPS games is just to much of a chore with this mouse and with the hefty weight it's just a bad gaming mouse. Recently got a couple optical mouse and didn't realize how bad this laser was in this until I used the much better optical sensors (EC-1A & deathadder chroma) Quote from Another reviewer ""Having trouble hitting windows button"" despite me having no problems using windows, that statements so true.

Support? there is none. I haven't had this problem myself but Roccat does not honor warranties. Mouse breaks after 30 days and you live in USA? Tough luck!

Software, it is just slow. Want to change some setting? You just have to be patient with it. it takes forever to open the program and to apply the changes it sometimes takes a few minutes. If you try to click on the software at all while its applying changes, it locks up and crashes. Also I am not a fan of the easy shift being set to the internet back button, the first thing I remap

I use this mouse for windows only to reduce where and tear on my gaming mice. Laser is good for windows bad for games, Decent comfort for Hand size 21cm x 11cm"
2.0	"San Fransico Rush, Rush 2 and Rush 2049 rank among my favorite console games of all time. By far the games I replayed most. I have clocked about 5497329867397 hours on Rush 2049 for my N64. So imagine how excited I was when I heard that FINALLY a new Rush title was being released. Then imagine my DISGUST and ANGER when I popped in LA Rush. Obviously this game was made by a completely different crew of people at Midway or headed by some bonehead project manager who thought it would be a good idea to strip the white knuckled fun from the previous games and incorporate a bunch of stupid features. Let's go over the bad things:

1. The ""crash cam"". Everytime you crash into a wall or another car, the game immediately shows you this crash in excrutiating slow motion for upwards of 5 seconds. Not only does this completely take you out of the excitement of the race and disorient you as to where you are, but THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN THIS OFF. This is by far the biggest dagger in the heart of this game. The other Rush games succeed because it is a relentless RACE, not some stylized garbage concept game.

2. Rush is a RACING game, not an adventure game. Not Grand Theft Auto. Not Driver. Not anything but RACING. So why they added in this stupid storyline and lame cutscenes is beyond me. Not to mention that the entire game is one big, giant commercial for MTV's ""Pimp My Ride"". You never get a chance to forget that ""West Coast Customs is gonna pimp your whip yo! Don't forget to go to West Coast Customs! YO YO! It's tight, that West Coast Customs"".

3. Retrying a race takes way too long. If you place badly, you have to go through all these stupid screens, then drive back to where the race begins, then watch the dumb cutscene that starts the race.

Oh well, looks like there is still no reason to get rid of my N64. I'll go back and play Rush 2049 over this waste of time any day. Not worthy of the ""Rush"" name. Terrible."
2.0	"This game is boring. I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried to like it. I went into it with a biased mind already deciding that I did like it. After all, I love the original Dragon's Lair, so I thought this one would be great. So I played it through. Boy, was I ever wrong.

PROS:
1. Good graphics, very reminiscent of the original DL.
2. Additional animations provided by Don Bluth.
3. Additional bad guys provided for the game.
4. Some visually innovative and interesting levels.

The good things about this game stop right there.

CONS:

1. Play Control. Huh? What's that? The play control in this game is the worst I have ever seen. Dirk moves sluggishly, even when you are holding down the Run button (which you will be doing a lot of, unfortunately). And that's another stupid thing. Why do we need a ""Run"" button anyway? We already have an analog stick! Dirk moves so freakin' slow without the run button pushed that it makes me wonder when anyone would ever use NOT use it. You find yourself holding down that button about 95% of the time.

2. Platforming. This ties in again to play control. The platforming in this game really sucks. For a game that emphasizes it so much, you would think the developers would try to get it right or at least do a LITTLE better than this. For one thing, your jump control stinks. For another, if you happen to have your sword out you are sunk. You will find yourself laboriously getting your sword out to fight or ring a bell, then hitting the button again to sheath your sword so you will be able to grab ledges. If you forgot, then sorry, but you're gonna die. THE END.

3. Ridiculously Difficult Boss Battles. Don't get me wrong - I LIKE hard games. I beat the original Castlevania for NES, so it's not like I have a problem with hard bosses. But this game makes beating a boss more of a chore than having fun. The Smithee is a real pain to fight. So is Singe. In fact, good luck beating Singe without reading a FAQ. There is only 1 way to do it, and if you don't do it that one way then you are DEAD. At least in the original DL you could learn from your mistakes. Not in this game.

4. Missing Elements from the Original Dragon's Lair. Where is the ""Drink Me"" potion? Where are the snakes? What happened to the barrel and the rapids? Where went the metal horse? This game could have been so great. It takes some good potential and just destroys it. This is NOT Dragon's Lair 3D. This is some other game, a sort of parody. Why did they take out so much of the fun parts from the original game? The metal horse and rapids would have been even MORE fun in 3D! But here they are nowhere to be found.

5. Stupid Treasure Incentives. You find and collect stuff in this game. WHY? None of the gold and treasure you get ever does anything that I can see. Maybe you don't get anything until you get it all. Good luck with that.

6. Disappointing Documentary. I liked watching the history of Dragon's Lair documentary (unlike another reviewer I did not experience any audio problems), but I did not like the rather self-congratulatory tone of the documentary. I mean, I like hearing about the history of DL, but I am not interested in watching an infomercial. That's what this thing felt like. An infomercial trying to over-hype what is actually just another mediocre platforming game.

7. Dirk's Blandness. Part of what made the original game so great was all the little grunts, whoops, and squeals that Dirk made as he went through everything. Plus all his funny facial expressions. All that is GONE here. The game would have have been so much better if they had just gone to the trouble to make a FEW cut scenes with Dirk doing some goofy stuff. Or at least have him do a few expressions rather than just stare ahead like a robot all the time.

8. Glitchy Crossbow and Magic. The Crossbow is a pain to play with. The camera jumps all over the place while you are trying to aim, and you will constantly lose your lock on on your target. Or worse yet, you will be targeting the wrong thing while you are being hit. This was just another annoyance to add to this game, as was the magic. None of the magic items were very fun or useful. They added virtually nothing to the game.

9. FINALLY, SLOW and BORING. Don't get me wrong - as you wander around this castle and game, the visuals are definitely interesting. But that's it. The interest ends there. By the time you beat this game, you will just be glad that you finally got it over with. The play control is so freakin' bad and slow that getting to the end of this game is a real chore.

CONCLUSION:

This game plays like a poor man's Prince of Persia (those games beat this one by a LONG shot!). It looks a lot like the original Dragon's Lair, but it's just not very much fun. This is a game that could have been so much. It had so much potential, but in the end that potential was wasted by the developers. They lost their focus. Instead of concentrating on redoing the original Dragon's Lair in full 3-D glory, they tried to do something new and added a bunch of unnecessary junk while taking out the cool and memorable stuff from the original. Disappointing. Boring..."

2.0	"Pros:
Nice, braided cable.
Multiple backlighting options.
Low price.
Dedicated multimedia buttons.

Cons:
-Slides around very easily on my desk.
-The lowest macro key gets in the way of my palm when using WASD.
-There is no play/pause button.
-Keys travel a long way before actuation.
-Macro keys seem to turn off any anti-ghosting. I macro'd a few number keys together and when hitting the macro key, the W would stop registering as being held down for movement. I would have to release the W key and press it down again. Tried macroing the W in with the other keys and it still forced me to stop running. That can't happen in gaming so I wrote off using the macro keys.
-Poor instruction ""sheet"" not even a manual.
-Backlighting turns off and other colors look odd with the blue keyboard features.

I had high hopes for this keyboard. I gamed on it for a week but it's not for me. I'll keep it around as a backup but I wouldn't recommend this as a gaming keyboard. Disappointed"
2.0	"This is a really cool device, and the price point was fantastic.  I travel a lot for work, and this is the perfect size to take with me and hook up to a hotel tv.  The unit is about the size of a credit card.  Works fine with both ps3 and ps4 controllers.  While I'm at home the PS4 remote play function works great for allowing me to play PS4 games in my basement in my theater, since my PS4 is upstairs in the living room. If you are getting lag from using wifi, look into dLink powerline adapters to allow ethernet between the devices through power outlets.  I got a pair for $25 and it made a huge difference.

The memory card situation sucks though, but that's a typical Sony move.  A 16GB card is $35 and fills up quick.  I would love a 64GB but can't really justify spending $100 for memory on a $50 device.

There is a limited vita library that is compatible, not all games work.  You can search online for the updated list.  Most of the ones I care about such as golf, need for speed, killzone, etc work great.

Edit: It's been almost a year and I feel I need to change this review from a 5 star to a 2 star.

I loved this thing, and I still love the idea of it, however Sony never supported it at all.  The compatible game list has changed very little in the past year, the limited PS store has remained almost identical month to month, I find myself looking for ANYTHING new just to have something to play when I travel however the majority of vita and psp games remain incompatible and nothing except some very japanesy looking jrpg games seem to be released anymore.

The only real use I have for it anymore is the PS4 remote play link which does a great job, and works near flawlessly and laglessly on my very fast home network.  So if you have a desire to expand you PS4 to another room in your house, this is a great product.  If you want to use it stand alone or hope to fine some games, you are gonna find yourself out of luck.  Memory cards are still (3.5 years after release) excessively expensive.  They could at least drop those do a reasonable price to at least try and make up for the fact they never planned to support the device past it's release date.

It is a shame Sony gave up so quick on the Vita, makes me worried for their future products like VR. Remote play is awesome, but this product has been abandoned by Sony and has very few new releases"
2.0	"This game was quite disappointing to me, since I expected typical FF battle systems, plots, and gameplay.

If you want something new, maybe this is for you.  If you want classic FF style on the Wii, I'd recommend Arc Rise Fantasia instead. It's not a ""real"" Final Fantasy game."
2.0	"I played Star Wars Galaxies from 2003-20006, Even though the game had little Star Wars in it, I stayed because of the friends I made in game.

I finally quit because of the following reasons, and no I was never a power player, never had a all powerful Jedi, and didn't quit because I lost my edge.

One major problem in the last year of gameplay was the broken promises made by the SWG team, they would show hints of great things coming in their fan events, and they would never come about, such as guild spaceships etc, what was shown at the fan event they said later was just something they were ""playing with"" and never meant as something going live, so the tease at the fan event was nothing more than a tool to keep players interested and playing.

Trying to get World of Warcraft players by copying WOW, and it's obvious since the NGE that devs, who the president admitted they all played WOW were there stealing ideas in some vain attempt to get WOW numbers, and as one article said at MMPOG.com  about SWG,""The release of WoW caused SOE/LucasArts to radically alter the originally planned ""rebalance"" to an ""upgrade"" that not only incorporated many of Blizzard's features, but also added a ton of bugs to boot. SWG was simply not compatible with a linear style WoW gameplay. Those who wanted WoW's features were already playing WoW, without the bugs."" if you play or played WOW you can see how much they are taking from that game and trying to incorporate it into SWG, which isn't compatible with the SWG game itself, causing major bugs and tech problems.

Lack of new content, while SWG devs are trying to incorporate WOW gameplay into SWG, they have basically dropped new content, they started after the NGE makine quests for lower levels and working their way up, so in fact if you are playing the game, you are paying while they rebuild the game from the ground up to make it more like WOW, in essense paying to beta test, I refused to do that.

Bugs and more Bugs, bugs that never was fixed from it's launch or still around, new bugs created as they tried to incorporat WOW gameplay into a game that wasn't made for it, and it seemed every patch they made to fix a bug, it would make 10 more bugs.

That are my main reasons I finally quit the game, I felt I was wasting my money, I got tired sitting around waiting for new content to arrive, and I wasn't paying for something that isn't finished, like paying for your new car while they build it. Broken Promises for a dying game."
2.0	"I have to come out, before saying anything about Final Fantasy XI, that I've never played a massively-multiplayer online RPG before this game. I never gave them a chance, because I was scared I'd play occasionally then become addicted.

 Final Fantasy XI Online for the Xbox 360 probably isn't the best game to get an impression on MMORPG's, because as both a game and an MMORPG, it falls short. As a game, it's boring. As an MMORPG, it just doesn't seem to be as exciting as other ones out there.

 The first problem I had with this game was the four-hour download-and-install time that I had to sit through before I could even think about making a character and playing the game. Four hours of letting something install...what is this, 1996? C'mon, this is ridiculous. I understand that there are patches and expansions that were added on, but I don't care. I'm not playing a game for four hours, I'm waiting on a menu to leave the screen.

 Once I actually began, I came across the biggest fear I had: Final Fantasy XI Online gives the player NO direction. It simply pops you into an open world and forces you to figure out where to begin. Sure, this isn't difficult for people who have played Final Fantasy XI on other consoles for years, but a newbie like myself is going to have a lot of problems and something should have been done to accomodate for that. Fortunately, the FFXI community was (mostly) nice enough to help me out. Some of them laughed at my pathetically low level, which was to be expected.

 Final Fantasy XI Online's gameplay is very stiff. It's menu-based and has an awful interface, one that is more confusing than it should be. In the game, the characters move slowly and look like stiff mannequins while attacking and performing any simple action. The world itself is detailed to a minimal amount, which is very disappointing. The enemy designs weren't all that bad, but from a visual perspective, FFXI is lacking.

 The music and sound effects are also pretty bland. Even the memorable Final Fantasy tunes don't sound as comforting as they usually do. Like most Xbox 360 games I've played, I found myself with the custom soundtrack pumping and overriding the in-game score.

 I didn't have expectations for Final Fantasy XI Online, and it's a good thing, because I'd have been disappointed. I can see where the addictive qualities are. It's fun to complete missions. It's satisfying to level up. It's funny to watch a newbie player (like myself) get killed by the Forest Hares at the start of the game. But I can't find myself getting into this.

 I do recommend that anyone looking into this MMORPG try it on the Xbox 360, since it contains the original game and every one of the expansions, including the new Treasures of Aht Urghan, which was also released on the PlayStation 2 and PC. But if you're looking for an Xbox 360 RPG, I'd tell you to pass on this. Boooooooring."
2.0	The game is just hard to understand and the story isn't very interesting to me, would only recommend for people that want something new to do with their DS or 3DS Just not a game for me.
2.0	Nothing to brag about.  Not a very good game and bored me to pieces....Nothing I'd recommend to anyone who likes games... Not Recommended
2.0	"A few years ago, the coolest thing to ever happen to gaming came to the playstation 2.  Wide open game playing.  Give the game player a city and let them go.  Give them a story to follow, but also give them some room to play and create their own story.  Give the gamer multiple ways to accomplish the goals.

This game IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE!!

Time after time while I was playing BATMAN BEGINS I kept going from level to level and situation to situation and there's is only ONE WAY or VERY FEW ways to accomplish each thing.  If you don't do things a certain way... you are riddled with bullets and killed in seconds.

THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CREATIVITY!!  You have no choice but to defeat the bad guys in the EXACT SAME WAY that the GAME-WRITER planned it.

This gets very old... very fast.

Of all superhero games that should adapt a wide-open theme. BATMAN IS IT!!!  Come on GAME-WRITERS!!  GOTHAM CITY for godsakes!!  Let us have some fun.

Please... give us a BATMAN meets GRAND THEFT AUTO mix and we'll love you for it.

Anyway... this game is a thrown together, repetitive mess. Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of fun playing as Batman and the graphics are pretty good. But, after completing about half the game, and getting killed 10 times everytime you enter a room with thugs... until you get it down the way the game-writer intended it... the game looses its excitement.

After 2 levels of the game, you are all of sudden in the BATMOBILE or the TUMBELER.  No explanation. No reason. But all of a sudden you are racing through Gotham chasing after dozens of bad guys in cars and running them down or running them off the road. WHY?  I don't know.  There's was no story to it. Or reason. Just... do it.

Thrown together... pointless... repetitive... promotional tool...

I mean... come on...  I can see how hard it would be for someone to actually create a BRAND NEW character like say... RATCHET & CLANK, or Rynn & Arohk, or Claire & Chris Redfield and have the gaming world embrace them... but how do you screw it up when you have an already established character that everybody already loves like BATMAN?

I tell you how... you give them a one dimensional game that is about as fun as figuring out the maze in your local newspaper.  Instead of giving them a game that lets the game player use their OWN MIND to figure out the best way to be Batman.

Give us Gotham City. Give us random crimes. Give us a game where is it up to us if his identity is figured out. What crimes we're gonna fight. Who we're gonna save. The makers of Spiderman 2 figured this out.

I won't buy another Batman game until they give us the wide open Grand Theft Auto format.  Give us GOTHAM CITY to explore.

This game... actually sort of insults your intelligence as an individual. The game writer is basically saying that he's the only one that knows the proper way to fight each thug and each situation.  Keep your creative ideas to yourself. ONE WAY TO DO IT BATMAN"
2.0	"They did it right this time - mostly. (Far Cry 2 was a real disappointment). Although FC3 is not at all like the first FC, except for being back in the tropics, it's a refreshing combination of FPS and RPG. You can go as far either way as you'd like... gather items, craft items, build points and personal resources... or just sneak around and pop off the enemy for as long as you'd like. Graphics are beautiful if a little bit 'choppy', and I find the AI pretty darn good! I've been dying quite often. The game is huge... I've barely scratched the map surface! But what I've seen in my first several hours is impressive! The story holds my interest enough and the characters are well developed. It's quite addictive, and find myself coming back in - shortly after leaving - to finish a mission - which can be difficult on just 'normal' setting! I guess the old 'hit F5 to save instantly' is gone for good in these modern games, so it does get VERY REPETITIVE on more occasions that I care for. NOT GOOD. I've found there is a bit of a learning curve at the beginning... and am still learning. It appears the game could last for many days... not just hours!!! Replay-ability is a given, IMO. Loads quickly, easy controls, very smooth (i7, 16 gigs, Asus mb, 250 gig ATI, etc). No problem with Uplay - although next to Steam it looks like it was built for 12 year olds (I'm an older long-time FPS fan from way back, I can be very critical, so my 5 stars should mean alot ;-)  Good job Ubisoft, but bad save system IMO!!!

UPDATE: OK... THE BAD: I find the save intervals very frustrating. I almost get thru a very looong intense mission only to 'die' at the very end then have to RE-PLAY the whole episode! I know: typical. But I'll be taking a solid star off of my review.

UPDATE: Uninstalled from my computer. Sorry... I gave it a HUGE chance. After 'swimming' to the pirate ship and undergoing at least 8 re-tries, and mashing 'space bar',  'C' and 'E' keys as much as I could, I always drown and die. Perhaps it's me... but having to re-do after MASHING the instructed keys over and over again sucks big-time. Tiresome. Boring. Etc. THEN, after I quit in frustration (at this point, the game does give you another chance to 'not' drown thru mashing and re-mashing keys)... and return to try again: I'M BACK IN THE WATER SWIMMING TO THE PIRATED SHIP needing to redo the whole 'mission' episode again... and again... and again. So long Far Cry 3. I don't call this 'fun'. (Ubisoft... what were you thinking?). Pretty bad..."
2.0	Well, I thought I'd bring back some nostalgia, bad idea. Very laggy and I have a powerful Macbook. It was a fun game back when it came out; but it is pretty old now. Oh well! Wow
2.0	"very cool headphones, my kids love them.

******update 5/10/2018*******
I completely forgot all about these headphones, but I wanted to let everyone know what happened. These headphones under normal use by an adult lasted only 4 months. The material around the ear fell apart and the 3.5 jack stopped working. Talk about a cheap knock off, steer clear from these. Waste of time and money."
2.0	Stick with 2D ninja turtles games konami cause they clearly can't make a fun 3d game. Not very good.
2.0	"The premise of this game is that the world has basically ended due to a string of tragedies like earthquakes, wars, etc. Oh. And then all of the sudden zombies demons pop up. Enter a gothic looking babe toting a Bigger-than-she-is broomstick shaped machine gun, who is (for some reason) going to shoot her way through the hordes of zombie soldiers to save us all. Sweet, right?

As far as I am concerned, for a video game - that's actually a fine premise. On top of that the design on the main character is pretty nifty. In fact, it was nifty enough for me to pick this up out of the bargain bin and take it home.

Thats when I played the game, and instantly regretted the $10 I had just lost. Truth is there is no way the developers looked at the final product and went, ""Yes. This is exactly what we envisioned. It's Perfect And Without Flaw.""

Now, the game is technically playable. But realistically it is so broken that it's just not worth your time and/or money.

The biggest issue is not the halfway-there stage layouts which are chock full o' pointless and distant dead ends, the terrible dialogue, and the ""Well, We Tried"" PS2 worthy graphics. It's the fact that the enemy AI is literally retarded. Enemies walk into walls, run around in circles, fire sporadically, sometimes notice you while you're a mile a way and can't see them and sometimes are blissfully unaware that you are right in front of them. If you get a car thrown at you, you have a 50/50 chance that it will kill you instantly or not hurt you at all regardless of whether it actually hits you or not. Most of your time spent playing this game will have you wondering ""What The Hell Is Going On?"" Not to worry. The game doesn't know either.

Sure there's nfity gun upgrades, and some ""somewhat useful"" magic (that is a huge pain to use), which helps the game be fun for like 5 minutes... or until you realize that it's not going to get any better.

It's sort of a shame because you can definitely see a really cool game that just needed a little bit of extra attention to live up to it's potential. Sadly, it's just not there, dooming this game to a life in the ""Bargain Bin."" Which is where it should stay... Sort of, Kind of Awful"
2.0	This seemed to be a cool game but was a little too much conversation between characters and it wasn't what I was thinking it would be and I thought my kids could build rides of their choice. It's boring honestly but I guess not bad for the price. My kids played it two or three times and haven't touched it in over a year. We bought Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 which more along the lines of what we wanted. I guess it depends on what you want to do with the game. If you want to create your own park, place your rides anywhere you want, make your own prices and need something for a very creative child, this is not the game for you. Try Tycoon instead. Not for us
2.0	"After I finally got it installed it had shoddy reception with my controller and kept connecting in and out. I had to move around to specific ""sweet spots"" in order to get it to work. Save yourself the hassle and buy a wired controller. Save the hassle"
2.0	"The Dank of Us
I was so excited for this game.  I got it as part of a ps4 bundle. I can't tell you how often I longingly looked at it in a store, only to say 'I will get it soon, there will be  a promotion, be patient as you save up for your ps4' [it also led me to conclude that this is the game that will never go on sale.  ever.] [which i finally just went all in on just to get bloodborne lol]
  I am so underwhelmed and disappointed. I thought after the opening movie, 'this will be great!'

oh, how wrong I was.

 Everyone said I should play it, that it would be awesome.  Maybe that impacted my expectations.  I felt like I was playing the walking dead meets uncharted.
So here are my complaints:
1. Not realistic.  Everyone said it would be.  Sure, you can die easily--that's realistic.  But enemies never run out of bullets.  Never.
And you can't hold much [but you can hold an inexhaustible supply of collectibles.]
2. Joel has a magic super mutant hearing ability that lets him see around corners.  and through space and time.
3. The relationship between joel and the little girl is predictable and boring.  Maybe it's because i play so much silent hill.  I wanted something different.  and if you've watched the walking dead i swear some of this stuff was copied. why not be UNpredictable and have him be a guy trying to like survive.  or a weak guy.  or something a little bit more imperfect and human with more growth.  maybe he could actually be a screw up, making bad choices left and right.  or something more interesting.  not rambo.
4. battle system is straight forward and incredibly boring.  just shoot, run, or sneak up on someone.  oh, and joel has super strength he can bash anyone's head against a wall
5. I really did not [again] want to see a bad game like uncharted reborn in a new form
Why I didn't give it one star:
1. It was nice to see a female character that wasn't overly sexualized. no loli [bc of her age] no weirdness.  it was nice.
2. Nice graphics--but at this point [and let's be honest] lots of games have good graphics and i kinda wonder if its just to make up for lack of creativity and plot these days i play my DS more than I play my consoles these days

I really find it strange that people say that I am being too hard on this game.  They say things like 'yea, you make some points but it's still good' but think about it!  The amount of time you invest, for nothing really interesting or original.  Yea, and I agree, it is hard to find a good original game these days but maybe if we stopped settling developers would actually make good games [and not lobby IGN with lots of $$ and other places to beef up reviews because people, this is NOT the best game to come out there].

But no one will probably read this.  But if you play it and you like it, that's great.  I am just angry that my expectations were not met. At all.
Sincerely--A sad girl in NH The Dank of Us"
2.0	"Of all the Sims 3 expansions, this was the only one that had so much information on it, my computer wouldn't play it well, so NOT well that I could never play it.  Now before you think I just need a better computer, let me say this, it was the ONLY expansion of ALL Sims 3 expansions, that was unusable on my system.  Even after going in to the game's edit  mode and deleting all the big resource eaters, It still wouldn't play well enough that I couldn't play it at all.  Not only that, it's the only one of the expansions that would not allow you to turn off specific alterations in other expansions.  Example:  In all other expansions and worlds, one can turn off Vampire, Witch, Fairy and Celebrity so that it would not effect other games, however Island Paradise does not allow you to shut off the ""mermaid"" option in other games.  So you always run the risk of having your characters turn up as mermaids in games you don't want them too and there is no way to get rid of it outside of uninstalling the Island Paradise game. This is truly the worst of all the expansions and not to mention the worst loss of money on my part since I never got to play it. The Worst of All Sims 3 Expansions"
2.0	started to play it, then put it away, was not happy I didn't like it
2.0	Way too firm on the control stick. Almost impossible to steer in a racing game, it's almost 90 degrees left or 90 degrees right. Any maneuver requiring precision is out the window Control stick is too firm
2.0	had a lot of potential, and would be a good game except the lack of information you often recieve.  be prepared to have to constantly look up how to find certain things, or how to defeat an enemy which you cant attack with any of your normal weapons, but some how have to take down. so close, but so far
2.0	A not so good follow up to a great game. Two Stars
2.0	I found the controls to be a bit finnicky, and the game itself to be rather demanding with a standard ps3 6axis controller.  it might be more fun/manageable with a wheel/simulator however with the 6-axis i found it pretty tedious.  i've played a wide variety of racing, FPS, strategy, etc games, and generally find the good in most games.  This one however I gave up after the first couple hours, and every time I think about going back to it, think I should sell it instead.  It just wasn't that enjoyable. not my favorite racing game
2.0	I didn't see any info that this game is online Team play only & no single player Mode. I'm going to ask for a refund. No Single player Mode
2.0	"My daughter and I are DI players since day one of 1.0, and I was super excited for this entry.  After playing the newer verson for two months, what we discovered were Star Wars masked glitches and a port that was rushed to the Wii U to meet a movie release.

The formula of the game hasn't changed since 2.0, and I won't dig into that.  Overall, it still works alomg with some great additions.  My favorite addition is the Path creator that can help make inanimate objects now move on a path.  Rollercoasters and even parades are possible along with custom platforming.  The live steaming Disney Radio tuner is also great along with a music tone pad.  With some work, you can make your own tunes (the Tower of Terror developer toy box showcases this featuer nicely).  There's new stuff in ever category, and that's great for avid Toy Box and INterior builders.

But with many additions come major issues with the Wii U build.

Firstly, there is ZERO utilization of the Wii U Gamepad (off-tv gameplay is a standard at this point and not a feature).  1.0 and 2.0 provided inventory and toy box options nicely with easy, Gamepad access.  You could navigate the toy inventory quickly.  Even mode menues could be navigated with the screen.  All this is completely removed in 3.0.  There was minimal effort done to supply a quick character image and disc info.  BFD.  This was a port job which omitted the unique features of the Wii U, and it gets worse.

Secondly, don't use a wiimote controller as the controls are completely botched.  Buttons described on screen don't match the controller buttons you need yo press.  They removed the pointer option for looking around when in zoom mode.  And they even managed to reorder the buttons to an uncomfortable measure.  You will be executing your special power randomly as that's now mapped to the down-arrow of the dpad.  And picking packs and tools is just unnatural now.

Next up, the glitches.  It's just a laundry list.  The crashes are frequent and hard.  Expect loud screeching and then a total freeze.  I don't blame the Wii U for this.  1.0 and 2.0 NEVER did this.  The game just wasn't optimized for the Wii U.  There are glitches on other consoles too as the Xbox One version can crash when a second player joins.  But the Wii U suffers the most as this build was ported so poorly.  And the frame rate drops are LUDICROUS.  I can count the frames at the worst drops.  Even character loading is insuffarable.  It could nearly half a minute to load a character when you swap figures.  THIS DIDNT HAPPEN IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS!

My recommndation is to avoid the Wii U version if you have the option with other consoles.  I'm impressed with the ambitious ideas this time around.  But usability and stabilty should not be sacrified to meet a release date. The disappointment is strong with this one."
2.0	Now that was a good game.  It had decent music, decent graphics for its time, and the characters you chose looked beautiful.  This is so so in my opinion, as it is not enough better from what I've seen to warrant an overhaul of your machine (you need a Pentium 3 or more, a dvd-rom, and everything else to work well; Daggerfall ran on WIndows 95/98).  I managed to get it to run even without the dvd-rom, but I wasn't really impressed.  That all considered, the controls are harder to maneuver (since I didn't have a manual, I had a tough time figuring out how to talk to people), and they scrapped the default design from Daggerfall, so you have to move forward using alphanumerics instead of cursor keys.  If you have a manual, and you have the specifications, it might be worth your while.  Given the choice, though, I'd rather purchase Daggerfall again. I just found out that even though XP generally forbids Daggerfall, if you are unlucky enough to have XP and not have capacity to run Morrowind, go type in Daggerfall XP patch into the search engine to reconfigure the system. I think the deal is that it's illegal to have both on your computer, so if you have Morrowind capacity (I hate you), you shouldn't install this patch. Liked Daggerfall better
2.0	Developed an issue when it would double-click every time I used the left mouse button. Very annoying for gaming. Very annoying for gaming
2.0	I don't know what I can say about this game. My expention most have been too high. Great chartors in the game, good old fastion shoot them up. Easy to play, as for being able to drive diffrent veicals. That really suxs. Not that many to drive. There many diffirent chartors to choose some. Each have there own roles! Choose diffrent combos for diffrent stages, which is cool! Fun but not for everyone.
2.0	"Have we not moved passed the point of needed AAA Batteries? I was hoping this remote would at least come with the batteries. It Didn't which isn't a big deal but the one thing I didn't like about this remote is HULU doesn't have a back button, it is alot smaller than the PS3 remote. The TV part was very hard to understand to register your TV and the instructions to control your PS4 and TV Volume and Channel buttons at the same time we very confusing. This remote should RUN Ps4 and the TV without having to hit a 3rd button cause the PS4 doesn't have volume or channel so those buttons should work individually but I can only get the Volume to work with the TV while in PS4 mode...I guess I was also just hoping it would be bigger but since we don't have any other remotes I guess this one will have to do

Update Hulu still doesnt work I just learned VUDU won't work at all Vue Netflix and Amazon Video seem Fine even youtue does great VUDU and HULU don't work. Batteries not included"
2.0	My fingers still slipped off when I used these. Two Stars
2.0	"This game has a very unique concept and story sets up quite good, but unfortunately is too tedious and unnecessarily overwhelming.  I feel like some design choices hinder the game flow.  For example, the game does not have regenerating health.  So instead of taking in the scenery and exploring the games open world, Im inclined to collect plants so I don't get killed when machines attack me out in the open.  Plus if I want to travel by horseback, I have to literally stalk a machine animal and hack instead of just having a trusty one by my side.  The game essentially feels like work.  Worst, the games main weapon is the bow.  While I do love the bow in games like Tomb Raider and Last of Us, its a chore to do battle with machines that don't go down as easily like a person or animal.  The bows firing rate and speed is slow compared to a gun, so you are required to do some fine accuracy when doing battle.  So far, it feels like every normal encounter is like a mini boss battle and Im literally just trying to explore.

As someone who enjoys open world games like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and even the just released Zelda: Breath of the Wild, I thought I could enjoy this game.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Those games added things to alleviate experience instead of aggravating it.  Imagine if Red Dead Redemption didn't have Dead Aim, a horse or regenerating health.  Imagine Tomb Raider without guns.  Imagine Grand Theft Auto without switching characters or cars easily available.  Imagine Assassins Creed without parkour.  Imagine Zelda BOTW without the ability to climb and glide.  Imagine all those games without those special perks.  You have a needlessly cumbersome game like Horizon Zero Dawn. A Tedious Slog"
2.0	The game was nothing special overall, but the thing that made it unplayable for me were the controls. While some adjustment can be made, options are limited. Keyboard and mouse or keyboard alone was unplayable. Bad handling
2.0	Boring! Same few riddles over and over. Meh...
2.0	"I've been a fan of the Kingdom Under Fire series since I played The Crusaders when it came out. As a fan of strategy games, I loved the fact that you had so many different units, weapons and armor to choose from, and I loved the fact that you could play as so many different characters in Heroes.

I downloaded the Circle of Doom demo off the XBox 360 marketplace, mostly because I was SOMEHOW hoping that, despite all the bad publicity and reviews the game has gotten, it would be a good game.

Boy, was I wrong.

To start, what happened to the strategy elements? That was the main point of the first two games, so why take it out of this second one?

Secondly, when did the game reduce itself to pure hack-and-slash-styled gameplay? I compare it to Dynasty Warriors for that reason (though I WILL say that Koei's Dynasty Warriors franchise is LEAGUES ahead of this game.)

To give you a rundown on the gameplay, it's like this: You start out by playing as one of the main characters, then engage in a tutorial mode after a cutscene (which I skipped, because I could barely hear the characters talking, as well as the fact that the voice acting sounded horribly lazy.) This tutorial mode teaches you how to fight (not very well at that.) You use the A and X buttons to wield your weapon(s), as well as the B and Right Button (don't confuse the button with the trigger) to use your magic. The first thing I noticed was how slow the response times were. Another thing I noticed was that, when holding the right button (as it tells you to do to use one of your special abilities,) it didn't always respond. You end up clicking or holding the button.

Another thing: The combat. When I engaged in battle with a few simple enemies, I found a fourth of my health knocked down based on the pure fact that I couldn't attack them fast enough (The Crusaders and Heroes' respond times were MUCH better and faster.) I don't recall there ever being a block button (which was in the previous two games.)

Added to this slow combat, movement is also slow. I can understand that the characters are carrying a good amount of weaponry and armor, but that gives them no excuse to move like snails. (The only excuse for that would be if they were carrying a hammer or some other weapon, which my character--Leinheart--wasn't.)

Finally, the map has you following a set path. In The Crusaders and Heroes, the map was free roam--meaning you could go ANYWHERE you wanted. In this game, you are stuck to a set path, which makes moving frustrating (and even more tedious.)

They're trying to pass the game off as an RPG, but the only RPG elements I see is the story (which doesn't seem all that good, considering you can't even enjoy the voice acting) and the weapon/armor customization (which there is hardly any.)

I didn't try the co-op mode, but I didn't plan on playing more of this horrible game. I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't buy the fourth installment based on the fact that this one was so bad.

The only reason I gave the game two stars was because... well, I played it for ten minutes, and enjoyed that small amount of time I played it (though I had no intention to play it further.)

One final note: I see that CoD was made by Blue Side and The Crusaders and Heroes were made by Phantagram, which is an obvious indicator as to why the gameplay (and everything, for that matter) is so different. I CANNOT, however, fathom why Phantagram would entrust a different company with their series. Seeing how CoD turned out, I hope they reconsider giving another company a right to make another game in one of their series.

If you plan on playing the Kingdom Under Fire series, skip CoD and play The Crusaders and Heroes (in that order)--you won't be disappointed in either of the two. Feels like a dumbed-down version of Dynasty Warriors"
2.0	"Its a a koei game alright. I am a sucker and one of these days I will learn, I hope.

Pro
-finally empire is back for what I always thought more interesting of warrior series
-Lots of small features add like marriage and nemisis, and change castle a little
-Character graphics are nice
-More story line and cut scenes
-resources add different element to game play. Can't use entire army if have little food and money
Cons
-While characters look good the rest of graphics look ps3
-Character customization has some new outfits but feels surprisingly limited compared to Dynasty8E
-Tons of new stuff but add little to no flavor to game. Wouldn't even notice if it wasn't for cut scenes
-Alot of movie/cuts scenes but all generic the same and last 2-3 seconds so get no emotion
-Still empire mode so control clans instead of characters.
-All the tactics and strategies/alliances do little to help and most of time not worth it.
-The map is still very small and game too easy/fast to beat

This is for either the hardcore and I mean hardcore Koei fans or those who have never played empires game before. They gutted samurai 4 add samurai warriors 2 engine with some small features that add almost no depth to game. My advice is have craving for Warriors game stick with 4 or head over to dynasty warriors8E because they at least feel like the made improvements over the last predecessor from 10 years ago. Like a car with promise of bunch of new bells and whistles but after an hour realize its not a good car. Hit and big miss."
2.0	"First thing I should specify is I am writing this from the perspective of someone who bought this Turtle Beach headset for use on a ps4 console ONLY.  As soon as you open box there are several stickers with reminders telling you that if you plan on using the px51 for a ps4 console, you will have to update firmware first.  Fine.  No problem.  I go to turtle beach's web page, create an account, and download whats called ""Turtle Beach advanced sound editor"".  I'm suppose to hook headsets up to my PC to update firmware.  Only problem is once I click the icon on my screen a box comes up that says ""do you want to allow this program to make changes to your computer"" click ""yes"", then nothing.  I deleted it, and redownloaded it.  Same result.  Turtle Beach support didn't help.  The forums didn't help.  So, basically I'm stuck with a $250 set of headsets I can't use for what I had intended.  I ended up just hooking them up to my ps3.  They work nicely with the system.  I own 5 different pair of turtle beach headsets and this is the only problem I've ever had like this.  If I could go back and do it again I would've went with the px4's.  I hope this helps somebody.  I'm kind of conflicted as to how many stars to rate them. PLEASE READ IF YOU PLAN ON USING FOR PS4!"
2.0	"Dark Kingdom is a hack and slash RPG in the tradition of Baldur's Gate, but unfortunately the game suffers from so many drawbacks its difficult to compare it to that series in a favorable light.  It's somewhat amusing to mindlessly hack away at hundreds of enemies, but it becomes tedious pretty fast and the gameplay and story do little to prop this title up.

Audience: I suppose this game is meant to appeal to fans of hack and slashers and capitalize on the fan base of games like Baldur's Gate.  Dark Kingdom is an unoriginal game, and it's pretty easy to see it was modeled after Baldur's Gate and games like it.

Graphics: The graphics are okay, though I don't think they capitalized well on the PS3's power.  Some of the cutscenes weren't even fully animated.  The background of the levels is pretty bland and repetitive, and while there are plenty of special effects (especially while fighting using the mage), the animation falls short.  I also noticed several glitches, where a character's sword would pass through another character but wouldn't show the impact, for example.

Gameplay: The hack and slash nature of this game makes combat an exercise in mashing buttons, but that's to be expected.  This is a role playing game, so you can collect gear and increase your character's attributes as you level up.  You can also collect 'essences' from fallen foes, some of which restore health and mana and some of which are used as a sort of currency to upgrade your gear and purchase powerups for your weapon.  Beefing up a character is always fun, and Dark Kingdom was no exception, though the gear selection is pretty bland and should be considered standard fare for a game like this.

The storyline for Dark Kingdom is incredibly dull and uninteresting--a shame for an RPG.  The dialog is pretty bad as well, and ranges from mildly corny to downright ludicrous.

Control:  A lot of pressing the X and square buttons.  It's pretty easy to control your character in this game, and it doesn't require much time to get the hang of.  The camera, which swings wildly at time and often makes it difficult to see what's happening, makes this more difficult however.

Challenge: This game is not very difficult to master and, as far as I can tell, raising or lowering the difficulty just tweaks enemies' strength and doesn't do much to make the game itself more of a challenge.

Multiplayer:  This game does have a 2 player coop mode, which is nice.  You can also join in a group online, which I did not try.

This game is a good rental, and may be worth borrowing from someone.  I personally wouldn't recommend buying it since the game is short and the replay value is probably very low.  With only 3 classes to choose from (standard fare--warrior, mage, scout) it doesn't take long to expend the character possibilities (you can customize, of course, but not enough to make it worthwhile), and the world of Dark Kingdom is just not interesting enough to really get immersed in. Pretty weak RPG that doesn't make good use of the PS3 hardware"
2.0	"The Nintendo Wi has proved unexpectedly successful in the current generation of video game players in large part because of its intuitive controls (its lower price compared to the PS3 and Xbox360 hasn't hurt either).

Even Granny who has never played a video game before can pick up the nunchuck, or whatever it's called, and throw strikes and spares bowling.

To be fair to Heavy Rain, I have only played the demo but found myself so exasperated by the non-intuitive controls that I had no desire to go further, however intriguing the story, however beautiful the graphics.

Someone else has mentioned that the game controls like Dragon's Lair -- a prompt comes onscreen, and you need to respond by pushing the correct button or moving the controller this way and that immediately.  Now maybe young gamers with sharp eyes and giant screen TVs can actually read these prompts from across the room, but to a middle-aged gamer like me with a standard-sized CRT TV, these prompts became invitations to push buttons randomly.

Even a simple action like knocking on a door or pulling an asthma inhaler out of a pocket became an epic confrontation for me.

IMO the best game controls are those that draw the least attention to themselves, and here the controls are the most innovative, if misguided, elements of the game.  I'm reminded of some contemporary rock bands who try to compensate for the weakness of their material by overplaying their instruments.

Other reviews here claim that you can get used to the controls as the game progresses.  In the course of the first hour of play, I found my frustration only mounting.

If you haven't played Heavy Rain, I STRONGLY urge you to download the demo from the PlayStation Store online BEFORE you buy the game.  If the controls are to your liking, then you may enjoy this unusual title.  But if you find yourself at odds with the controls here from the git-go like me, then you will want to spend your money on other games like Red Dead Redemption that feature equally intriguing stories and eye-popping graphics but which employ standard controls. For Control Freaks Only"

2.0	"I, for better or for worse, had expectations for this thing. Expectations that were seriously not met. When I took it out of the Amazon box, I knew right away there was a problem; this thing was in a blister pack. Is that bad? No, that doesn't automatically make something bad in the least. However, it was the kind of design job for a set of headsets that you'd find hanging on a hook at CompUSA at a discount next to the better ones. Basically, it looked cheap. I took it out of the blister pack. It FELT cheap. As light as that new chocolate with air bubbles in it. And just like that chocolate, you get less product when purchasing it. The phones pivot, which I guess is to adjust to head shape better. To me, it just makes it slip off more often. The microphone feels somewhat fragile, and is almost as bendable as a pipe cleaner. However, it is part of the product that actually contains metal. As for the plastic, McDonald's toys put it to shame. Feels...dissappointing. When I pulled out the adjusters, guess what I saw? Glue blobs. You know, the kind of glue that you have to rub your hands together to get off in first grade art class. There's a leather pad on the top, though I doubt it's real leather. I take it back: it isn't. It is, however, poorly sewn on the seams. And small. After wearing the headset, I couldn't manage to keep it in one place for very long, and let me tell you, my head is certainly not too small. Sound quality? Let's just drop the ""quality"" part. It does play sounds, though. Many sounds! As for the bass, however, this thing couldn't make a lion's roar sound any more threatening than a house cat's. I swear you'll transform your favorite tunes into a new genre- one that doesn't have bass or sonic depth in any field. The cherry on top of this low fat cupcake baked with Splenda is that I didn't look like a cool dude in the mirror wearing a sweet pair of phones- I looked like a butt clown. Are there ANY positives? Yes, surprisingly. Once I actually made the headphones stay in one place, they were quite comfortable. As for the microphone, it works. Does it work exceptionally well? No. But it works. It's also got some cool little palm trees on the inner pads of the phones. Unfortunately, ears don't interpret sound blasted through cool graphics as rich and full. Should I expect music quality sound from a gaming headset? Perhaps not, but this didn't even fulfill my reduced expectations for a headset. All in all, this is pretty lame. I'm definitely going to buy a more expensive one with some of the money I can barely recover from returning this joke to Amazon. I'm shocked at how pleased the reviewing community is with this chintzy piece of junk. My honest review, take it or leave it"
2.0	Do not buy refurbished. I have 3 and this one would not work with my pi for some reason. I hooked it up to my computer and had issues as well. The other are GREAT. Refurbished is not good. Buy NEW not REFURB
2.0	"This game has so much bug it's unbelievable. Dont buy it yet until they fix this game. I'm just cursing as I'm playing this game, the developer change so much to the game that made it fun. The game is so slow, the pick and roll is useless, posting up is so hard to do now, and the worst part is that blocking and losing the ball is so easy now. This game is trying so hard to be realistic but they losses the fun part of a game being a game. I want to be playing a game where I can be Blake Griffen with a tomahawk dunk in a open court without some guy able to chase me down with a block from behind everytime, how's that realistic. I rather play nba 2k14, because that was so much more fun than this hot garbage right now.

PRO
-Graphic is better and more and better animation
-Shot is more relaistic, not all shot falls
-The my career mode is better and has a story and voice acting
CONS
-Game is super slow
-Horrible shot meter
-Blocking is too easy and too frequent
-Losing the balls happen too easily
-Post up is so much harder to pull off
-Servers is bad already and the game didn't really officially comes out
-Pick and roll is so useless
-I hate to say this but NBA live 16 is way more fun than this hot trash rite now. the developer change so much to the game that made it fun. The game is so slow"
2.0	"I have been enjoying the ace combat series for sometime now. But this one leaves alot to be desired. The mission briefs were dull and very uninspired. The missions themselves were very similar. It didn't take long before one mission seemed the same as the next.  The aircraft designs were very cool and that was the best part of the game. Some of them were nigh brilliant. Although most of them were enemy aircraft.
  I finished the game in around 3 hours which makes its lasting appeal minimal. I am waiting to see what they are going to do on the PS2.
  If you played the others then give it a play. It's still an okay way to spend a couple of hours. A game without lift."
2.0	bought new received used and returned Two Stars
2.0	"OK, here's the perspective of someone who's not a huge Star Ocean fan... Going in I just wanted a fun and colorful sci-fantasy JRPG.
It was a waste of my $20.00
Cheap, bland and boring except when the combat difficulty spikes through the roof on certain boss battles, and your brain-dead party members refuse to cooperate. And there's optional systems for grinding crafting stuff, that seems to have been put in out of some obligation as the game doesn't even really explain this stuff.
I like the idea of Star Trek meets Final Fantasy but it needs more budget, a bigger world, better graphics, and characters who are at least vaguely interesting. This game fails on all counts.
I was lucky, the bouncing camera didn't make me sick, but I did notice it and it's another thing that makes the game seem unpolished.
The designers claimed this was a renewal of the series to bring in casuals and western gamers. I think casuals will be bored (until the boss fights cause them to give up, if they get that far) and if this was anyone's first JRPG, it might as well be their last. bland, low budget and boring with nasty difficulty spikes in a small linear world... avoid"
2.0	This game does have nice graphics and sound.  The punch selection is pathetic.  There is no way to choose body blow v. head blow.  You can get your boxer to move around the ring, but you cannot truly make him duck and bob.  Basically all you do is try to press your buttons faster than the computer can.  If your fighter is ranked higher, no problem, fight someone tougher than you and its aggravating.  Basially you just stand there and exchange blows until someone falls.  No strategy. Not good at all
2.0	I got this for cheap but based from online recommedations and I don't particularly like it.  Steep learning curve and dated graphics/game play.  Kind of a neat idea that may be cleaned up in the newer edition but after trying this I'm not that interested. kinda fun but not really into it
2.0	They'll ban you no matter how many of these you buy. Two Stars
2.0	Wrong game system but no problem returning Two Stars
2.0	"Like the Spider-man franchise itself, this game never quite fires on all cylinders, and often misfires badly when it does manage to strike.

Firstly, the graphics. The city itself is bland, poorly textured and devoid of a lot of the basic humanizing elements we've come to expect (Grand Theft Auto, Watchdogs). There is just nothing to write home about here, and in fact feels like left overs from other games.

Second, the mechanics. As we hopefully all know, Spider-man navigates mostly via webbing his way around the city. This in itself works decently, but the controls are clunky, making you control each arm independently to swing, and then there's issues with a special webbing that launches you horizontally forwards. Couple this with the game will not register certain points to ""web"" to, you often will find yourself dropping to the ground mid-leap, despite plenty of buildings around you. In all the controls are not intuitive, and the mechanics of moving around the city just aren't refined.

Third, the basic elements. The game relies on formulaic graphics and cut scenes which after a couple minutes stop being interesting and become annoyingly intrusive. The completion of basic side-missions now generates at least two cut scenes each time (start and finish) and some a third or fourth in there. None of these cut scenes are special to that particular mission and seem like they could have easily been omitted as many open-world games do.

The aforementioned side-missions are now de facto required to even play the basic storyline. The player is responsible for maintaining a Hero or Villain status bar. Completing missions successfully raises Hero status, while ignoring them causes them to expire and lower the status. This comes into play in that there is a group of cops that will chase you if you drop out of Hero status, and it makes the game quite difficult to navigate.

Fourth, the meat of the game. The storyline is weak and comes off as tired. Missions aren't completed in a ""free-roam"" manner like regular open-world games, but are actually pocket-missions by themselves that together assemble a rough storyline. And when you complete them, the game actually drops you in random places around the map, not by where the mission either started or ended.

Finally, there are tertiary tasks to complete, like taking pictures of random objects around the city, however the alerts for these missions do not trigger a clear alert to the player, so they can stack up for quite some time, including ones that cannot be completed anymore. No clear explanation of these picture-based alerts are ever actually explained to the player.

In all this is a poor game, especially when stacked up against a lot of the other, far better games that have come out recently. Could've been amazing but just can't capitalize on it's options and doesn't make use of the consoles it runs on. Boring & Uninspired"
2.0	Bought this game for xbox 360 got a good price like 28 bucks on here. I've played MVC 1 and 2 liked them so I said hey A new version of MVC3 with more characters. Only to find this is crap. Online is full of Spammers and noobs that choose easy mode and pull of expert combos without having to practice and get good at the game. Offline you CANNOT pick what charactes you want to fight against I mean WTF? major reason I bought a fighting game is too fight with characters I want to chose to fight. NOPE none of that. Story mode is just like the other beat a couple stages fight the boss. I DO NOT RECOMMENED. Save your money or get a better game like Naruto NS2
2.0	"I was a huge fan of LBP1, LBP2 was pretty good as well, but I still didn't like it as well as the original.  My son recently purchased LBP3 for my PS3 and after a couple of days of playing he seemed to lose interest.  I decided to give it a go, and I immediately was underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time.

Similar to the second installment, you have other characters you can use that have special abilities that can reach areas that sackboy can't.  For example you have Toggle, who can change sizes on demand that allow him to fit in tight spots (little), and to activate weight sensitive switches (large).  There is also Swoop, which is basically a bird that can fly through areas that have no platform to stand on.  There is also a frog like character that can also wall jump.  In addition to the new characters, Sackboy has many abilities of his own depending on what he is wearing, (jump boots, and a helmet that allows him to attach to and glide along pipes).  In this regard, I was overwhelmed with the new characters, and new abilities.  The beauty of LBP1 was in its simplicity, but with LBP2, and definitely LBP3, they just seemed to want to do way too much never allowing the player to fully enjoy the core game.  In this regard I was overwhelmed with everything and it seemed every other level was basically just a training level to learn yet another ability and/or character.

In terms of being underwhelmed, for starters, the game is way too short.  Its possible to beat this in one sitting which didn't seem to be the case in LBP1.  Personally it took me a couple of days playing only occasionally.  I counted four maybe five distinct ""stages"", and that was it.  Of course there are challenges during these stages, but they add nothing to the overall story.  To add insult, 50% of the levels in these stages were basically training levels to teach you how to use a particular ability.

One major problem with this game is how buggy it was.  Quite often after I completed a stage, the game will be stuck on a loading screen, forcing me to quit the game using the PS button and start over again.  This happened way too often for my liking, and this even occurs when playing the user created levels.  Just recently I was playing a very good user created level, and then when I got to the end, the game was stuck on the loading screen.  For ""shiggles"", I decided to leave the game in this state to see just how long it would take for it to get past this point.  I left the PS3 on and decided to watch the NBA playoff games.  Seven hours later I switch back to the PS3 and the game is still ""Loading""; I haven't played the game since.  In addition to this, there are buggy levels that make a level harder than it really should be.  I recall one level where I had to use the jump boots to cross a wide chasm, but it was impossible to do because the jump point that I was supposed to cross simply did not work.  Only after looking on Youtube did I figure out the work around.  This is unacceptable, I really thought games were play tested before released, but apparently I am just being naive.  I certainly can understand a minor bug here and there, but blatant bugs like I've encountered should have never made it out of the testing phase.

Difficulty wise, I believe it may be too difficult for its main target audience (young children).  Even someone like myself that has been gaming for 30+ years encountered a little trouble on the later levels (especially the Swoop levels), but after practice and figuring out the timing I was able to complete the game with out further issue.  However, if veterans have trouble with this supposed children's game, I can only imagine how frustrating it must be for young kids who are still developing their coordination.  Games like this are supposed to be fun and provide some challenge, but instead for many younger gamers, it may just be just utter frustration.

All in all its an okay game, but misses the glory of the original by miles.  They try to do way too much and the many bugs and freezes only add to my disappointment.  The game itself I would give three stars to, but because of the bugs I bumped it down to two.  If another LBP is made, I sincerely hope more emphasis is put on QUALITY rather than QUANTITY. A Prime example of what happens when Quantity trumps Quality."

2.0	"Just knowing that this game has made a return had me extremely pumped. It really took me back to my childhood. No seriously.. it did. First thing I tried to do was the gliding 3-pointer. LOL.

Graphically it is no where near the level of 2k. Game play needs some work as well. Though I can say that the game does deliver a great presentation within the game as well as better controls when handling the rock (which I like). Unlike 2K I don't find myself having to master thumb stick movements to play the game.

Managed to play one online game and it was horrible. May have just been my opponents connection or could have been the game servers. But I either way, the lag was ridiculous.

Ultimate team manages to find its way on to the title. Seems legit, but lacks options.

For what its worth, I'm just glad to see the game is back. But for as long as the game had been in production, I was really hoping for a little bit more. They have a great foundation for future titles and I definitely will be checking out the game next year as it can only get better. Right? Welcome back NBA Live"
2.0	"Alright I haven't played this game for more than two hours, but felt the need to save some others some money and put my opinion in for what it's worth.
Good news: if you STILL play doom 1 and 2, then THIS is your game! You'll probley think it's game of the year material.
Bad news:  if your not in the doom 1 and 2 group, you're probley gonna HATE this game.  I'm in the hate group.
There is no great gameplay here, no AI, no inspiring level design, it's not scary.  There's enough pretty graphics to make nice screenshots to sell the game. Mainly it's just shoot collect stuff and move on to next area gameplay.  Boring.  The monsters just spawn then run at you.  You just run upto them and take them out point blank with a shotgun.  It's hard to even get hurt in this game, the main thing that will hurt you is the collaterial damage from the explosives that ""just happen"" to be laying around the map right in your projectile path.
My recommendation is download the demo, and if you think the demo is the most awesome gameplay you've seen they buy it. But don't buy this game without trying the demo!
This game ran at top speed on my system:  AMD 2800+, Radeon 9800 PRO 256, 512 Ram. There's nothing spectacular to look at, so my guess is it will probley run at top speed on a majority of systems out there. Just didn't like it"
2.0	"I got these for free, with the purchase of a PS4.  Now I see why they tossed them in for free.  The bar that goes over your head just snapped the other day w/ a minimal amount of pressure.  I have a Tritton headset that I have had for about 8 years, and nothing like this ever happened with them.  The other gripe that I had with these headphones was that they are uncomfortable if worn longer than a half hour.  You can adjust them all you want, but the fabric will just heat up your ears and irritate them to no end.

Of course they are great to own as a freebie, but don't waste your money buying them. Pretty flimsy and uncomfortable"
2.0	The mouse was great, while it lasted.  But just after a few months the buttons would stop working.  It's a shame too since I have had better luck with their keyboards. The mouse was great, while it lasted
2.0	"It captures pretty well and the video quality is acceptable for the price. The sound has issues.

It's true what other reviewers have said about the capture software being horrible, but it IS fully compatible with Opensource Broadcasting Software (OBS), which is completely free online. You need to open it in its designed software to change settings for the device's hardware, however, so you still need it. Mine produces an annoyingly high pitched whirr if the sound is set at a higher level than ""really low"", but that's fine as I need to keep the sound low anyway to talk over it.

Putting this through to the computer and then having the computer display on the TV resulted in dropped video quality, which is far more noticeable on a very large screen, so I'm getting splitters for the individual RCA connectors to connect to the television and computer separately, sold on this page:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cable-Matters-5-Pack-Gold-Plated-RCA-Split-Adapter/dp/B0141KPHR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cable Matters 5-Pack, Gold Plated RCA Split Adapter</a>&nbsp;(All negative reviews of the item involve people using them for the opposite of their intended purpose, so I know they're solid. I'll update this when I know for sure.)

Edit: I had no idea this thing had so many problems until I tried to capture a game that WASN'T super smash brothers. I figured Super Smash Brothers Brawl, with its high framerate and tendency to push the Wii to its limit, would be the best test. Well? It had serious, SERIOUS issues with... Miss Pac Man. No, I'm not kidding. And Mario Kart. Any game where any amount of black is on the screen regularly. It had some incredible problems with dark colors, the image would go completely bananas.

I've included a screen capture of the Mario Kart pause screen from the device... The top half of the screen with the decal and blue sky are fine, but the dark road... A big thank-you to Amazon Support for allowing me to return this thing just outside the usual return window, as it was a big deal to me.

I have no idea whether this is how they normally are, unable to handle the colors black and grey, or that my device was just defective, but for those considering: You have been warned. TEST WITH DARK COLORS. The issues... The headaches... It's going back."
2.0	controller support was terrible and other add-ons that offered support was not better.  support seemed to be made to lag keyboard and mouse.  all call of duty games are worth revisiting and could generate massive sales if they would go back and add the support.  if it was offered on the xbox, which means the support is there due to use of a striped version of windows being also used it would be to easy.  the developers obviouse to not want the sales, or benefit those who play. controller support was terrible and other add-ons that offered support was not better
2.0	"One of the nicest looking Ps3 games I ever seen.

I would give it a rent first see how you like it.., Its a masher so expect to hit things hundreds of times and you don't get to fight how you want to you must always do it how the game dictates no room for creativity, which is a big disappointment.

This is very much controlled like a Ps1 game. You cant look around at all. You cant look at your objective either, so you will be leaping blindly at walls waiting for a spot where it garb on and it looks silly. The game takes full advantage of the fact the controls are terrible at your expense. You will find your self walking one way only to have it go the other direction.

As nice as it looks, it can be a pain to play. You have to be so precise even to climb a simple latter that you will end up doing the same thing over and over just to have it open a chest or climb or what ever. If its a timed moment forget it, sometimes it takes 5 tries just to get him to grab on to what ever or make the ICON appear.

Remember, Sony paid huge dollars for the review scores in the form of advertising dollars to Gamespot , ETC.

Very disappointing!

RENTAL (6.8) - God Of War 3 - Beautiful, but still uses PS1 controls."
2.0	It's like a really long cutscene with the occasional turn based fights. I did my research and everyone told me if you never played one, THIS was THE ONE to play, sold so many people onto the franchise...etc. I'm not even an all shooter fan, I love Champions of Norrath, I just couldn't get into it. Very creative and colorful,but it's just so corny, like I'm watching Days of Our Lives. Try a Final Fantasy They Said...
2.0	The button-play in this version is horrible and causes cramps, especially on Expert mode. Keep in mind this is coming from a person who's played since guitar hero II...there's a level of gameplay that this lacks. But for the price and song selection available, it's not that bad. I recommend to any Aerosmith fan. Rock on!
2.0	I didn't buy this game. After the Master Chief Collection came out completely broken, I don't buy games without playing them first. The only reason to have Game fly is to save me from the disappointment that I would have felt if I had bought this game. I wanted to buy this game after an ad showed people's reaction to the game. Glad I waited. Let me say this game was slow. I didn't know about the comparison to Resident Evil else I wouldn't have been so keen on this game. I dislike RE games because they're slow also. Bad camera angles, slow play, and an inability to make choices plague RE games. This was a lot like those. I really didn't get more than an hour into it before it went back in the mail. No running in a game is just a way to artificially extend game play, as is forcing players to wait for a character to leave a room before you can move forward.  The very beginning epitomizes just how little thought went in to making a FUN game.  Making a game with a weapon system like this game has is a slap in the face to all who buy it. A frustrating and confounding weapon mechanic, like only using a melee weapon once then poof, is NOT fun. All the elitists out there are going to say the weapon mechanics make it hard or challenging. I say hard or challenging dies not equal fun. Hard games can be fun, this is not so with this game. Again, it seems like every aspect of this game was designed to artificially extend the game play length. I give it 2 stars for the graphics only. Somebody needs to hire the art department from this game and put them to work with a good design team. I'm so let down by Bethesda. With the success of their open world Fallout, series I thought they would know what gamers like. This game is the opposite of Fallout. Why would you do the opposite of what was a hit 4 times? Some enjoyed this game. Good for them. I am so let down by this game. It's no wonder it's in the bargain bin at half price less than 4 months after release. Actually it was in the bargain bin back in December. In contrast Far Cry 4 is awesome. Glad I rented it first.

2.0	"Be careful who you buy from and make sure the controller has never been used before, because Sony didn't make these controllers to last. All three of my Dualshocks malfunctioned at some point, and the last one I bought new as a replacement didn't even last 6 months.

If you're buying one as a replacement, you may want to consider trying to repair your old one first. The ways in which the Dualshock fails are pretty common, and there are a lot of videos online for do it yourself repairs. You just need a small screwdriver that's meant to use for small electronic devices.

Otherwise, just buy an off brand PS3 controller and save some money. There's no reason to pay full price for a Dualshock now because they just don't last. The knockoffs are good enough and last just as long or longer than a Dualshock. Not built to last"
2.0	While connected, my tablet controller kept turning off.  That means that it charges the battery slower than the battery depletes.  So you may as well just stick to the power cord, rather than pay money to rotate the battery charge a bit. charges slower than the battery depletes
2.0	I have really enjoyed the harry potter games especially the prisoner of azkaban. First of all, the better with kinect description is complete b.s. There is a special menu to use the kinect during which you just fight people. The actual game itself is so full of story that I rarely ever feel like I'm playing. I love harry potter. All the books and movies have impressed me and inspired me but this game was a fail. I guess I have it in my collection tho. Boring
2.0	"Pros:  I really liked the way it fit my hand. The grip was  comfortable.  There were plenty of buttons that could be customized.  The Logitech gaming software worked great. Logitech customer service was great.

Cons: It failed to track consistently. It burns right through the standard battery it shipped with. I had to contact customer service to learn that UAC had to be disabled in order for logitech's software to work.  I could live with that, and running it wired when it ran out of juice, but the deal breaker for me,  was the tracking thing.  That just won't work on the games I play. All of the sudden the sensor took me all over the place. I really tried to like this mouse but..."
2.0	This game has no plot, no single player, no split screen, and only decent online multi-player battles.  Its been a week and I am bored of it already feeling no connection to anything to do with it unlike a Halo.  This leaves it as another compelling reason to ignore online only games. I think the only reason it is selling well and being well reviewed is it simply has no competition at all. Decent Online Multi-player and nothing more at all!
2.0	"Oni should have a lot of appeal: it's got a pseudo-anime look, well-done 3D characters, a great hand-to-hand fighting system.  Unfortunately, it's got a horrible aiming system for many of the guns, an idiotic save game system, and wildly varying difficulty.  And the character design for Konoko in the anime opening is 1) ugly, 2) varies within the movie itself, and 3) looks nothing like the character as drawn either on the box or the 3D polygonal Konoko.  Most of all, this game has none of the gameplay magic found in Bungie's other games, particularly Myth and Myth II.
A little explanation of the problems.  The save game system is easy enough: you don't know when it's going to save, there are relatively few save points, and the save points frequently don't tie into the game world, so you'll be stuck fighting some difficult point over again if you die.  The aiming system for guns varies with the gun, but for the pistols and submachine guns, it's virtually impossible to hit anyone (thankfully, that's true of the enemies, too).  There's also almost no ammo to be found in the game world.  It's easier to lure enemies around a corner and go hand-to-hand.  More fun, too.  The difficulty level is annoying: at first, it's pathetically easy; later on, you start facing three or four enemies, some of whom appear out of nowhere while you're fighting.
Frankly, Bungie bungled this game.  Coulda been great; came out poor. Bungie's worst PC game since the port of Marathon"

2.0	"I used to be a fan of UO but now its just not worth it, the gameplay still keeps its goodness and that's why I gave it 2 starts and not 1. But the servers are getting worse and worse, and now it's just not worth paying 10 bucks a month for a game that is laggier than Diablo 2. Don't get me wrong this is a good game with good gameplay and great fun but the lag is destroying it. If they decide to fix the servers I will bring my review up to a 5. If they make the game free but keep the laggy servers then I will only change it to a 3 because that would prove that Electronic Arts are just too lazy and don't care enough about the players enjoyment of the game to fix anything and they would have basically just give up on the game.
If you want a free online RPG with less lag then get Diablo 2.
If you want an MMORPG with little lag then get Asheerons Call, Asherons Call 2, or Dark Age of Camelot. 10 bucks a month for servers that are crashed half the time?"

2.0	I don't like that Amazon doesn't carry the Special Edition for PC.  I bought the Legendary Edition thinking it would have a mods option in the main menu.  It doesn't. It also has no access to the Creation Club content. Not Equivelent to the Special Edition
2.0	"Being a Lego kit and Lego Video Game Fan my wife purchased this through Amazon for my birthday on her account just a little over two weeks ago. Now I see the price has dropped $20.00 already. I'm playing it on a new Xbox One, also purchased through Amazon.

My main issue with the game is that it has crashed now 3 times, twice during the beginning level before a save station was used, and once after the first save station was used in the first level, The Land of Oz.

I've read elsewhere on the Internet that others are having the same crashing issue, on various levels, on various consoles, such as the PS3 and Xbox 360, especially if they are using more than 2 or three characters on the 'portal'. Placing a Lego Dimension character on the portal controller causes that character to appear in the level as a playable character, which is necessary as each character has a specialized skill set needed to solve the game's puzzles. The portal controller seems to have the ability to hold 7 pieces, and you are supposed to be able to hot swap them in and out to play the game properly. The crashing just seems to happen while you are playing, not swapping characters.

For the record, the game does not freeze, it actually causes the Xbox One home screen to appear with an error message very similar to a Windows OS error, stating that an undefined generic error has occurred, with different error codes such as OX80004005.

I've been playing several games on this new Xbox Box One, new Xbox One games and a few older Xbox 360 games (all purchased from Amazon) that are now backwards compatible on the Xbox one, and none of them have crashed, frozen or otherwise stopped working... so far, so it appears to be a specific issue with the Lego Dimensions game itself.

I would love to love this game, despite it's potential to be expensive, requiring that you purchase at least several other characters at the minimum to complete the basic game, but honestly I've played video games since they were invented, delivered in all sorts of formats, Carts, CDs, DVDs, UMDs, Chips, Digital Downloads, (which despite using a disc based Lego Dimensions, the Xbox One still had to download 8gb of data to even start to play!),  and have had only 2 other games crash due to bad coding, back in the day before console games where able to be patched.

Lego: This game needs a PATCH! Lego: Please fix this game so it doesn't constantly crash!"

2.0	excelente Two Stars
2.0	This controller is good for emulators and that's about it. It doesn't conform to the standards that many other controllers are using and it doesn't have enough buttons to make it match what other controllers are providing and what games require. This controller is good for emulators and that's about it
2.0	Don't pay a penny for this, folks. Move on to an EA game. There is very little in the way of actual physics calculations between players in this game, every interaction is merely a scripted animation. RBs are stopped in full stride by shoestring tackles. WRs run their routes at half speed while the DBs shadow them *IN FRONT* of their routes. Offensive line programming is horrible. Guards and tackles blow assignments on EVERY play, doubling up on a DT and allowing LBs to come free and tackle the RB at the handoff. There is no player momentum, a flaw I've noticed in a number of Sega Sports games, meaning any player can stop in mid-stride and immediately run full stride in the opposite direction. Sit back and watch the computer play: 3and out, 3 and out, 3 and out... This was an incomplete game that should not have been released. So what if it looks pretty? It plays like crap. Good looks, awful gameplay
2.0	"I've been a Castlevania fan since the first NES game, and seems like their titles are hit or miss.  This one is definitely a miss.

It started out so promising.  The first chapter was awesome.  Just what I expected and wanted.  The graphics were incredible; the storyline was interesting, but still had a decidedly Castlevania feel to it.  Then it all fell apart.  The storyline was predictable and, in my opinion, just plain stupid.  The characters were irritating (why does everyone need to have an accent?)  The gameplay was terrible.  Many times I would get stuck on an invisible ledge or wedge myself just offscreen.  And there were instances in which I spent too long trying to figure out where the @%*# I'm supposed to go now!  (Oh, it's that little ledge that I can't see from this angle)  The controls were inconsistent; sometimes you pressed down to drop, other times you had press X.  The game necessitated delicate movements, the controls were anything but.  The puzzles were way too easy.  Helen Keller could have completed them.  Lords of Shadow played like a crappy God of War.

The beginning CGI scene was fantastic.  The ending CGI scene was good.  In between was bad.  Poor storyline, too easy puzzles, distracted gameplay.  I blame the game testers for not giving adequate feedback to the developers.

I've already sold my copy of this game, and I certainly won't be buying the sequel. Save your money and buy something else"
2.0	The game is ok. Wasn't as exciting like I thought it would be. It's alright
2.0	My son is the perfect one to review this since I don't play games on this type of platform.  He said the big drawback is it's not wireless but it will do as an extra.  Compared to his other control pads, this one feels cheap and light and he said when he was using it, it was so light that it just felt strange.  The buttons are very very sensitive.  My son likes to slam the buttons (his words) and this only requires a very light touch and he just can't get used to it.  He played with it about an hour and one of the buttons stuck down.  He said this wouldn't be his first or second choice but it will do in a pinch if his other controllers break.  He said he wouldn't pay alot of money for ths and he would not recommend for gamers that are really into the games. will do as an extra
2.0	"Lost Odyssey has great visuals, especially in the many (and I mean many) movie sequences. In the end however the gameplay is repetitive and you are dragged by the nose the entire story line.  The storyline is one big clich around the central theme of immortal characters, the other themes are the same from every Final Fantasy game from which it borrows the feel and turn based combat style.

Due to the very high quantity of videos it feels like something you are watching rather than playing, and occasionally the game allows you to play through a couple of combats to give you an illusion of interaction. The voice acting (in English at least) is absurdly bad and cheesy, soap opera style, the script of the story doesn't help and the actors must have felt somewhat helpless with the lines they were given (specially the interactions involving the protagonist, who is trying to be far more serious than the rest of the project).  The only truly artistic part can be seen in the poems that appear in the form of dreams, although completely devoid of any gaming element they are (some of them) truly well made.

Without spoilers one can only wonder what they were expecting placing characters like the grandchildren in the game. I honestly felt silly through major portions of the story for playing this. The lack of control over saving also makes this a difficult game for the busier player since you cannot be assured that you can play ""just another 10 minutes and save"".  You save when they let you save, you play when the movie is done, and you fight at every six steps. The combat system is the FF turn based we all know but with a timing mechanism of two rings (to create SOME sort of interaction by the player) that while it seems like a good idea it gets boring as hell.

As a final note the steady progression of the opponents makes no sense, at some point you are battling regular soldiers who are still a match to your characters despite the fact that you are 20-30 levels higher since the last time you faced them.

In the end I felt the Lost Odyssey is a childish game they purred a lot of resources in. It isn't worth the time though. Repetitive Gameplay kills the entire game"
2.0	I was amazed at the PC version of spore and wanted to see how this would work on the WII. Do not get it expecting the same play style as the PC version fitting a action specific story mode. Not as good as the PC game Spore
2.0	"Compared to the original TDU, almost everything in TDU2 was improved except one important thing - the driving model/physics. At the end of the day, this game is a racing game, so no matter how many cool features you add to it, if the actual racing isn't good or fun, then the whole game become pretty ""meh"".

This is exactly what TDU2 is, meh. Everything from the graphics, the sound and the island has been improved as well as various UI tweaks and it all looks good, except when you start driving it feels awful! The cars are glued to the road, they don't feel like real cars at all. I know it's not meant to be a realistic simulator, but they didn't even try! The off road cars aren't any better either.

I'd tell you about the other features and merits of this game, but quite frankly, since it's a driving game where the driving isn't fun, there's no point. I really wanted this game to be good and surprise me. I bought the original TDU and I was in the closed beta for TDU2. I bitched and moaned in the forums when the developers wanted feedback on the driving. They didn't listen, they kept it the same as before.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, no amount of really cool features or nice graphics can save this game from an awful physics engine. Great Idea Ruined by Awful Physics"
2.0	"Ok Im not going to base my review on the 12 locked characters already on the disc. I'm not happy about it either boys/girls.

Pros: Capcom is getting paid ooo yeaaaa dig it!

Cons: This game does not feel finished or polished compared to ssf4. The feeling of the game feels bad..The game is getting bad reviews but the pro gamers love it because they get it early & free. So don't listen to the posers..

Tekken characters feel awful when playing them cant really explain it.

Side note: The game you can tell will be sped up with future patches along with the gem system being tossed out.

The levels in the game make no sense. You can tell Capcom Japan was behind it due to the random weird stuff. You wonder why the gaming scene in Japan is dying.. If the Japanese gamers don't like it then why would we want to be force fed this crap?

The roster feels rushed. So many cool characters were left out due to what's to come.

Pass on this game guys. I love Capcom but will not recommend this game to anyone.

All in all Capcom has lied & dropped the ball with this game. Rent it don't buy"
2.0	"In December of 1996 I purchased a Sony Playstation, finally upgrading from the old Sega Genesis.  One of the first things I did was to try and find a football game that was as exciting and fun to play as College Football's National Championship for the Genesis.  To this day, that still is one of the best football video games ever made for any console.
This game was not available for the PSX.  For me it essentially boiled down to either Madden '97 or NFL Gameday '97.  I gave both a try, but settled for Gameday.  First of all, I was never a real Madden enthusiast.  In fact I did not own a Madden title until Madden 98 for the PSX.  That year I ended up getting Madden over Gameday because I thought it had more depth than the 1998 version of Gameday.  Since then I've bought Madden simply because there has not been decent competition in terms of football sims.  Madden is obviously not without its flaws (see my review for Madden 2002 for the PS2), but simply put there has been no other viable alternative for people like me who are looking for football sims.
Why I do I tell you this?  Because I want it to be understood up front that I am not a single-minded Madden zealot.  When i first heard that Sega was making NFL 2K2 for the PS2, I was elated because I knew that 2K1 for the Dreamcast was hailed.  Further pushing my anticipation was the memory of playing the old College Football game on the Genesis.  If they put the effort into 2K2 that they did in the old College Football game, I knew this was going to be a great game.
Let's just say that Sega gets a B for effort, but they fall short in execution.
GRAPHICS - 8  As a person who has very little knowledge of actualy computer operations, it's my opinion that graphically 2K2 does match up with Madden.  I think the animations are, for the most part, pretty strong, with very little shimmering.  However, in the close-ups you can still see that the animations need a little refinement.
AUDIO - 9 In my opinion, 2K2 supercedes Madden in the audio department.  If for no other reason, you don't have to listen to Madden drone on and languish through the same limited collection of phrases that he's been using in this series since 1999.  The audio is timely and keeps with the gameplay very well.  In my opinion, 2K2 really outdoes Madden in this department.
GAMEPLAY - 4  Where it really breaks down is the gameplay, however.  Players tend to skate across the field and the physics simply don't match up against Madden.  For example, I've had receivers run 10 yard hooks only to be knocked clear back to the line of scrimmage after catching the ball for gains of maybe 2-3 yards.  This is simply not realistic.  In the no huddle offense, the team magically appears at the line of scrimmage instead of realistically trying to catch up from the original line of scrimmage.
The AI is somewhat awkward, too.  I've been playing with Michael Vick at QB, and it's nearly impossible for him to get any mustard on a ball throwing off his back foot...and he's got one of the strongest arms in the league!  Meanwhile, the mild-armed Brian Griese - controlled by the computer - routinely drills 40 yard bullets accurately downfield off of his back foot.  What gives??
But the largest gap between Madden and 2K2 is in the respective franchise modes.  Say what you want about Madden, but anyone looking for a realistic franchise play would certainly be taken aback by the grand depth of the Madden mode.  The 2K2 Franchise Mode is woefully inadequate.
For example...
1. Players are rated in 5 areas specific to their respective positions using a bar graph for each trait.  In Madden there are countless traits on which players are measured.
2. Players are not assigned colleges or universities in the college draft.
3. At the end of a season there's nothing that tells you how much a player has progressed (or regressed) from the previous season. You know it happens, but you pretty much have to memorize your players' individual ratings in order to determine how far they've advanced.
4. There do not seem to be any player awards at the end of the season (e.g. MVP, Rookie of the Year, etc.)
5. Once you enter the next season activities (i.e. re-signing players, making trades, drafting), there is nothing that shows you what the draft order will be.  This is critical if you're trying to trade up to pick up that franchise player or to trade down to get more picks.  In order to do this, you have to write down the order from the season before.
6. I've played 9 seasons now and the salary cap has not increased.
7. Although I've not tinkered around enough with it yet, it does not appear that you can use created players or teams in the franchise mode.
8. The retirement times of players is not realistic.  Jamal Lewis retired after 6 seasons in the league.  Keith Brooking retired after only his 7th.
There are 2 things that I DO like about Sega's franchise:
1. You can actually trade future draft picks.
2. Players' overall ratings actually ebb and flow throughout the course of the season.
I bought this game after reading only a couple of reviews, mainly because I have been less than satisfied with Madden this year.  I was genuinely hoping that NFL 2K2 would take my mind off of the flaws with Madden, but it's only made me appreciate more what Madden offers.
Admittedly, some of my frustration is based in the fact that I am learning to play a new football game and that it will take some time to adjust.  But in my opinion, if you're looking for an actual football sim, Madden and the many options it provides through its complex and deep franchise mode is the better alternative.
But I anticipate a better product from Sega in 2002 and will gladly give it another whirl. Big Disappointment"
2.0	"Well, i only made it works when put both controls at the same times but anyways this products is full of designs mistakes.
First the blue ligths becomes something annoying, second it works only with the PS3 on, not even in standby mode, three you can't charge only one control when you want it. not recommended"
2.0	"Ok, the original version of SMB 2 was only released on the Famicon which really sucks. This version of the game was a remake of Doki Doki, that is why the story seems really strange for a Mario game.

I will reccommend Mario All Stars, if you want to play the original version of this game. At all costs don't get this Doki Doki crap. The sad truth about this game"
2.0	i guees its an ok game i just coundn't get into it all that much Two Stars
2.0	"To insomniac, this game was like retaking a class that they had already received an A for and getting a D.  I really wanted to enjoy this game but everywhere they got it right on the first one, they really failed on the second.  Instead of fixing issues from the first one like the fact that you can't go prone, they only capitalized on the first one's shortcomings with their own new batch of failures for the second. I would give this game three stars for online game scale, not that it is as fun as any of the others out there, but simply for scale, as you can play up to 60 players, but that's not worth $65.00. The reason why I dropped it by an additional star is purely personal as I got ripped off when I purchased it off of ebay; It was listed as new, but when I received it not only was it not new, it was severely damaged from misuse by the seller and it froze everytime I inevitably died and try to restart, making the one hit kills even more annoying. I could go on for over two pages on the misses in this game but another reviewer has already done so excellently. And I quote;

By  Raul G. ""Raul G."" (USA) - See all my reviews

""Fun:3.0 out of 5 stars
Resistance 2 comes as somewhat of a disappointment to me. I absolutely loved the first Resistance game for the PS3 and it was truly the first ""must have"" title for the system.

Unfortunately many of the things that endeared me to the first game have been modified or dropped completely in R2. The excellent narration between levels featured in the first game is now completely gone and sorely missed. The story suffers because of it. Now instead of getting a quick update of the fight against the Chimera the game relies on in-game voice acting to move the story. It simply doesn't work for me. The objectives are never quite clear enough, the motivation isn't quite there. I felt like every level was simplified to ""kill the guys who don't look like us"". Very disappointing considering the first game had such an excellent story.

Another disappointment to me is the graphics. While R2 does add more colors to the originals palette the game is by no means stunning. Graphical glitches are prevalent in everything from evident polygon seams to areas completely missing textures. The environment textures themselves vary from pixilated to blurry. This all stands in stark contrast to in-game bosses which are stunning. The graphical detail from level to level is also uneven. The very first level looks terrible while the next level, situated in a redwood forest, looks great. I can't help but feel that the game could've used another 6 months in development to improve the graphics.

Also cut are the fun vehicle sequences from R1. That's right you won't get a crack to pilot any vehicle of any type at any point in the game. Co-operative offline campaign has also been cut and replaced with random levels that feature no story to speak of. Very disappointing.

Another change to R2 is the weapons themselves. The first game featured a large variety of weapons that were added to the player's inventory permanently. Now, not only has the amount of weapons offered dwindled; but you can only carry 2 weapons at one time. I can understand certain players citing more realism as the reason for the change but it simply doesn't make sense - Resistance isn't about realism.

Changes too have been made to the health system. In the first game the player had a traditional health bar that provided the pertinent information. That has now been removed in favor of a damage system represented by a red screen. The more damage your character takes the more red the outer ring of your screen will become. I don't have a problem with the new system as much as I have a problem with the one-hit instant kills that have been added to the game. Certain enemies retain the capability of stopping you dead in your tracks. Unfortunately this is abused by the developer and you'll find yourself randomly dying at the hands of enemies in what can only be described as trial and error. It's very frustrating to be killed unexpectedly because you're unclear where to go or what to do or by invisible enemies.

One change to the game that I liked is the inclusion of a cast of characters that Nathan actually fights alongside. The first Resistance game was essentially a one man show. While in R2 you have no direct control of your squad-mates they are there and fight along with you. The AI for these characters is moderately capable.

The online portion of the game has clearly received more attention in R2. You now have a slew of options including cooperative and competitive online modes. A big selling point touted by the developer is the ability to fight in 60-player online battles. My experience thus far has been mixed. The massive battles I've played in are unorganized and chaotic. I confess that thus far I'm not a fan. The game attempts to encourage small squad based objectives but it hasn't had the desired effect. In online games I've started it seems that my squad immediately fragments into individuals.

Ultimately, Resistance 2 will probably be liked more by newcomers to the series. Fans of the original game will likely notice the shortcomings and changes all to well. Still, R2 is a proficient enough of an effort and here's hoping the next game realigns with the efforts of the first. ""

2.0	"In the long history of PC games there haven't been many James Bond-brand releases on the PC; in fact, I can't name any offhand (aside from maybe James Bond Jr.). The brand has had a fruitful experience for the consoles, including the famous release of Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64.
With the release of a new Bond adventure in 2002 publisher Electronic Arts wanted to create a big cross-platform Bond action/shooter that didn't have to rely on the new movie but still carried the name and was released at about the same time. Unfortunately they decided to bet on relatively old technology and some strange creative choices to do it (at least on the PC version), and the result became a rather uninteresting game called Nightfire.
The player assumes the role of dashing MI-6 agent James Bond, 007, here to free the world from nuclear tyranny, British ex-patriots, and so on. Each of the nine missions precedes a full-motion animated cut scene that uncovers more of the general plot and details the next mission. More average-quality cut scenes are interspersed throughout the game at various points.
Nightfire is a first-person shooter and shares all the nuances of that breed of game, with the same familiar style of control schema, albeit with some trademark differences. Aside from the variety of guns available, Bond can switch to a gadget inventory and select from one of those - the gadgets are primarily one-event-type items. A wristwatch serves as a laser for cutting locks, for instance, though you couldn't even use it to get the attention of a guard.
The other gadget worth noting is the sunglasses, which when put on can switch between different shades of the spectrum - handy for locating hidden areas, laser traps, or through women's dresses. The downside is that you can only use it for so long as it runs on (rechargeable) battery power, not to mention the sunglasses are buggy.
As stated above, there are only nine missions -- each have a variety of submissions with their own set of objectives. While the level design is adequate it pretty much pushes the limits of the engine, including multiple loads in a single level. The objectives, which update as the mission progresses, is not very helpful at telling you what needs to be done or even why. Only by going through a level, killing everything, and checking and/or destroying everything else can you really figure some of them out - unless of course it happens to be a level where there is a never-ending stream of bad guys and there is no clue as to what to do.
Another problem of note is that a player can effectively win a mission by accomplishing an objective, get killed because of something else, and still lose the mission as the mission results screen is delayed while the game still runs. I actually ran into this on a particularly annoying boss level.
Mere mention of the console game-style boss creatures is another bad mark. This by itself is not too annoying, but the bosses, not to mention the situations you're thrust into, are painfully stupid. Speaking of painfully stupid, that would be the perfect description of the game's artificial intelligence (AI) - enough said on that.
This is not to say that Nightfire has some redeeming qualities. Some of the levels require going into third-person mode, which is a fun switch. Bond can only carry around four big weapons at a time, so you will have to strategize in some situations. You can use multiple different methods in certain missions to accomplish the objective. On the very first mission, Bond can sneak his way into the castle complex through the back way or fight his way through.
Nightfire includes a multiplayer mode as well. It consists of LAN or internet play, supporting up to 32 players, with three modes of play: combat training (deathmatch), team combat training (team deathmatch), and capture the flag. In team games one team assumes the role of the good guys while the other team is the bad guys - and they have different models to match. Unfortunately, multiplayer mode seems tacked on and a few of the levels are very unbalanced.
Several times already I've described the Nightfire engine as being stretched to the limit. That's because the developer, Gearbox Interactive, went with the Half-Life engine to develop the game, and added in their own in-house goodies. Gearbox is no stranger to using the Half-Life engine, but to release a major title with a four year-old engine (at launch) is troublesome at best.
Character models are average if not great, and the animations are about the same - though there are some specialized animations as well. The Australian secret agent is a blond Lara Croft rip-off.
I'm a bit of a Bond movie traditionalist so it's hurtful to sit through a particularly hard level of Nightfire listening to some techno/new age version of a rehashed Bond theme over and over again. Oh, there is some variety, and a small bit of it is catchy, but enough is enough. The song featured in the intro sequence by the female singer Esthero (and plays in the background on the menu screens) is quite good, however. The voice acting for the various characters, including Bond, seems very uneven.
James Bond 007: Nightfire is a lackluster game stuck in an old engine that probably should have gone through a bit more in the design and implementation stage. Aside from a nice opening sequence and a few ""well that's kind of cool"" moments in-game Nightfire should definitely have its license revoked. James Bond 007: Nightfire (PC) Review"
2.0	"Wii Fit, like all Nintendo Wii (and DS) products, is polished and immaculately presented. Its very approachable and friendly. The Balance Board is a tremendous piece of kit - rock solid and absolutely excellent at what its supposed to do.

As a product dedicated to fitness, though, its pretty lacking. Now, don't get me wrong - it is far better than doing nothing (what I am used to doing), and actually has some nice perks to keep you going (like score tracking and an unlock mechanic). But it doesn't let you customize a workout, and progression advice is minimal. It literally just lets you do whatever activities at any time. Now, I could go to the gym and do exactly the same thing, but I still would want to get some advice from someone or something. Wii Fit doesn't do it!

Another problem is that between activities, you have to stop and navigate menus. It'd be much better if there was a flowchart like menu for setting up workouts so you can go one after the other, keeping the heart rate up. This is a very serious deficiency and I wonder why Nintendo didn't put it in.

All in all, as an introduction to fitness, its pretty good, and at $90 its really pretty affordable if you have a Wii already. but I really hope some other company comes out with a good fitness videogame using the balance board, with more workout and eating tips. That would really be a great thing. Good as an introduction"
2.0	Skyrim was better Skyrim was better
2.0	"Ironically, I had preordered the console version of Call of Duty long before I had played the PC version. Yet with the release date oh so far away, I decided to take advantage of the recent price drop of the Call of Duty PC game hoping that it would tide me over. However, after playing countless hours of the game on my PC, I'd have to say that Call of Duty: Finest Hour is a bit of a disappointment. I understand that a console has nowhere near the processing power of a PC, yet I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by FH's graphics which were simple and bland at best. However, I was mostly disappointed in the lack of save points throughout a level. That meant after spending ten minutes or so blasting your way through a difficult level, you would have to start the campaign all over again from start to finish if your player is killed. I always appreciate a challenge, yet not when the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against me. The one aspect that the console version did translate well was the ""war is hell"" theme. The beginning level featuring you as a Russian soldier taking back Stalingrad from the ""steeking Germans"" was intense with gunfire raining all around you and enemy soldiers around every corner. The death animations are overly exaggerated which made in difficult to distinguish whether or not an enemy was either wounded or dead only to have them shoot you in the back. I played this game for only an hour before I filed it away with my other games. I imagine that I will someday go back, but in the meantime, I'm having too much fun with the PC version. Lost in translation..."
2.0	broken game, predictable story total mess stay away till at least they patch the performance issues i don't know if batman dies but the game does
2.0	I don't like that you can't use keyboard and joystick together.  It's one or the other. Two Stars
2.0	Does not work with Windows 8.1 No windows 8.1 suport
2.0	I love the design of the mouse, but I used this mouse for almost a year, and the mouse started to not register clicks randomly, and this really impacted my gameplay. Great design, really comfortable but sadly starts to have issues really quick
2.0	"Ive played ALL Armored Core games since its birth. Not too mention Steel Battalion, Steel Battalion Line of Contact (until shortly after the servers went down), and a bunch of others. Including that abysmal game ""Front Mission Evolved"". No.. I never played ""Steel Battalion Heavy Armor"". Just looking at it was enough to cause pain. So anyway, onto the review.

-Graphics: The mechs, the parts, the weapons, all look great. Seriously. The maps... No. Like all AC games they put about as much focus into the maps as you put into someone you throw into an oubliette. They forget about it. So don't expect any amazing landscapes or wonderous battlegrounds here. Its a bunch of buildings, streets, fences, and occasionally some open landscapes with a hue change. All their focus was on the mechs, your ability to change their colors and such. Which can be fun if you find a build you like, then you can sit there for hours staring at your creation admiring yourself.

-Single player story: Garbage. After you go to the trouble of fine tuning your masterpiece the single player campaign is no more than a series of simple ""go kill it"" or ""go kill them"" or ""go do this/that and kill it/them"". I beat the game, and it was so memorable I can't for the life of me tell you the point of the story. You cant even tell who you are fighting for in this game the story is that poorly written, and voice acted. All your base now belong to someone who wrote the dialogue.

-Multiplayer: Wow. The multiplayer has regions locked out. So basically you can only play with people in your region. If that wasn't bad enough, they advertise it as having a theatre mode. NO. Its a recording of a top down view of a schematic map, that has icons replacing the mechs and what they do is replaced by text actions. In other words ""Bill448 killed Max2109"" is the ONLY thing you get to see from yer battles. That and a circle with a number in it to represent you on a top down viewed map. They advertise this game as ""5 vs 5"". NO. this game locks 1 of the 5 players into a command role of telling other players on your team where to go and what to do. This should have been an optional ROLE. But no... sorry you have to sit there and watch from, thats right, a top down view of a schematic map clicking on icons telling your team what to do. So its not ""FIVE VERSUS FIVE"" its ""FOUR VERSUS FOUR"" so don't let them lie to you. Lastly... the developer support for this game is practically NONexistent. Its been about a year since they released it. In the developers homeland they got a patch to fix issues with the weapon balance in this game. Here in the states... Nope. The gaming community here in the USA didn't get a fix for things broken in this game (which last I checked nobody likes buying anything broken) until about a year later. So over that year of having a broken game how much of the gaming community stuck around? None. So the people to play online with left a LONG time ago.

Bottom line, you buy this youll have nobody to play with but yourself. IF anybody is online playing this... good luck. They all have their little ""clans"" and unlike the Steel Battalion world map scenario this games multiplayer is based on regional segregation, and in-game clan animosity. Good luck with that. YOU BETTER READ THIS IF you are considering this game."
2.0	"I am coming from the wired version of the Razer Naga mouse, so I was really hopeful that I would find something here that addresses all the little flaws of that mouse while keeping its awesomeness.  On paper, it does.  But when I tried to use it...

The mouse is HUGE.  I am a 6'0 male so I do not have tiny hands or anything, and it felt enormous in my hand.  To make that worse, the buttons are sensitive to light presses, and that G-Shift button under your ring finger was getting pressed all the time, I would even hit the right mouse button on occasion when I was trying to adjust my grip to not hit the G-Shift button.  I felt like I couldn't acutally let my hand rest comfortably on the mouse without pressing stuff.

Ignoring all that, I'm sure the mouse would be fine.  The indented side buttons feel weird after being used to the Naga, but would probably be good once you got used to it.  It's nice you can change the backlight color to anything.  Build quality is good, software seems good.  The G-Shift button is a great IDEA, but I just can't use it.

I've never seen something so awesome on paper, so well thought out feature-wise, be so poorly implemented from an ergonomic/usability perspective.  I'm returning mine and going back to my Naga mouse. I wanted to love this mouse, but I just hate it.  :("
2.0	"I was a huge fan of the previous 2 incarnations on the Playstation 2. I was hoping that this game would be a natural evolution of a game that was great on a simple platform (probably because of its simplicity), upgraded in sophistication for a more complex PS3.

I was pretty disappointed. The graphics are weak, which could be forgiven if the story or gameplay was more compelling. Unfortunately, the full potential of the PS3 was in no way maximized. There is no subtlety or strategy in the ""jobs"". The swords you can acquire or build are not as interesting or powerful as those in the first games. The villains are easy to defeat. The ""instant kill"" and ""chain kill"" effects touted for seamless battling are difficult to trigger, I found myself mostly mashing the square button over and over to kill everyone.

There is a reason that the first 2 games still retail for over $50 for used copies but this game is down to $25. This is not a true heir to the series, in spirit or gameplay. Not a PS3 level game"
2.0	Terrible. The case doesn't even fit a DSi and everything else is useless junk. Everything looks plastic and the bag that comes with it is just a bag. Cheappp
2.0	"I was excited about this game, at first. And if you are new, you will be excited as well. There is a lot of new stuff for the usual MMORPG player who is used to the typical dwarf sword and sorcery. It's fun...for the first 20 levels or so. Then the grind starts. The highest I reached, after 300 hours of play, is level 34 out of 50 (highest level). Around level 30 or so, I noticed how hard it was to level up. I don't mind it taking awhile, but in City of Heroes, you have limited things to do to level up.

Basically, you fight villians. It's fun, but after you have killed the same type of villian thousands of times, it's not fun. And when you level up, you don't always get a new power. At level 32, you only get a new power every 3rd level. What this boils down to is that after your hard work to level up, you have to level up 2 more times to see a cool new power. Not fun. There is no carrot to keep you interested in playing.

Finally, *if* you reach level 50, there is nothing more for you to. In other games, there are epic dungeons or PvP. Here, there is nothing.

I give the game 2 stars for the uniqueness of play and fast action. However, it is not enough to keep you interested in playing, especially with the STEEP xp curve. I've played other MMO's before and this one is the longest time to XP I've ever seen. For a month or 2, you will get enjoyment. Just don't plan on staying interested or making this the MMOG you plan to stick with for 2 years. Have to agree with Darius, this game is a grind"
2.0	"This kit is okay at best.

I'm comparing this to the white Eneloop/Amazon basic AA batteries. The Amazon basics and Eneloop are basically the same batteries that are rebranded. They both would get over 40-100+ hours depending on how much I use the microphone and force feedback system.

This kit barely gets 18 hours on a good week.

The official xbox play and charge kit seems to do much better than the Nyko kit. That kit would usually get me 30-40 hours before a recharge.

Why do I have so many kits? My dog keeps loves the rubbery wires.

The Eneloop package(4 batteries and a charger) costs $15. I bought 4 Amazonbasics AA batterie(rebranded Eneloop) for $10. Now I change the xbox one controllers batteries about once a month typically. The extra AA batteries are also very handy for other electronics. This kit is okay at best. I'm comparing this to the white Eneloop/Amazon basic ..."
2.0	"Well at the beginning it was fun but there're too many inconsistencies in the character and the story that I dislike,for example you have to stop thieves but to get money you just do the same bad things but with the hacking abilities, with a ton of mission where you just repeat the mechanic over and over again I got bored not even the main missions scape these fatiguing design, zero replay value.

 I brought this thinking to experience some sandbox fun but this game is going out my collection. Spend this money on something else."
2.0	Razer Synapse is the worst program I have ever used (an I've been on PC for over two decades) for setting up key maps.  There are other problems with it, too, but if it actually worked well, I might be able to overlook them.  But it doesn't.  Setting up the keys for a single game is a long, tedious, and boring process.  The key mapping aspect of the software is an abomination, a crime against good UI and user experience.  The Orbweaver might be superior to the G13 in hardware (I have both), but they're nowhere near the same level of sophistication when it comes to the software.  And for the record, I was never a huge fan of the G13 software but I definitely appreciate it a lot more now. Razer Synapse is a horrendous abomination, a crime against humanity
2.0	Good game, but gets boring really quick without people to play with, and now that virtually no one plays anymore, its pointless. Boring.
2.0	"Simply put, just let the Dreamcast stay the way it is.  The entire thing feels really cheap, and the connections feel like they'll break off.  The Dreamcast was never meant to be played in anything besides the regular AV cables, so don't force it.  The VGA connection works as does the S-video.  I got this to play off of my HD computer monitor but theres no sound, so you then you have to find other ways to get sound or use headphones.  Not all games even support VGA, had I know this I wouldn't have gotten it.

Also,I'm pretty sure my ""new"" VGA box was used before.  It looked like they just stuffed it in there at the last minute, and there was no inserts or even explanation as to what the connectors did. not worth the money"
2.0	"I loved the Mass Effect franchise. I have hundreds of hours in the singleplayer campaign and close to a thousand hours in ME3 multiplayer.

This game is not them.

I experienced multiple gamebreaking bugs within the first 5 hours of singleplayer and haven't touched it since.

Multiplayer was ruined the second EA added p2w lootboxes. Thanks to a bloated manifest, maxing your manifest without paying real money takes about 600-700 hours. Lootbox RNG combined with a lot of hackers and some broken mechanics means this game is a no go.

Oh, and don't forget that Bioware/EA dropped further bug fixing and development/DLC as soon as they realized sales weren't meeting their expectations to go work on bigger projects meaning Mass Effect Andromeda is essentially abadonware only a few months after release. This game is not the Mass Effect you know and love"
2.0	Instructions say: ensure both device and receiver are in low-latency mode. That's great but it doesn't say how. I have Avantree headphones and this Avantree dongle. For all I know I paid 6x the price for a dongle that's operating in regular (non low latency mode). Low latency?
2.0	"Couldn't wait to finish this game! My LEAST favorite AC game of them all. Didn't really understand all of the modern day missions, and there were more than usual. I only bought one weapon the entire game, and didn't buy anything else. So finding treasure wasn't necessary and kind of took the fun out of finding them. traveling through one wilderness to get to another wilderness to get to a city where my main mission was, was annoying after the umpteenth time! Never even bothered to do anything in the wilderness because nothing seemed important. I ALWAYS climb to the waypoints to synchronize, but trying to climb those humongous trees and falling out time and time and time again, just made me say screw it. So I didn't bother with them. I never even bothered with the side quests, because some of them seemed confusing for me to take the time to figure out. I couldn't wait to finish this game and be done with it.

On the plus side, I did like the story and time in history. Other than that, I thought it was pretty bad. Never play again...."
2.0	At best, a cheap God of War clone.  It will make you pine for the God of War experience. Two Stars
2.0	"Hiya,

I've been looking at this game for a while. I wasn't worried about being an early adopter, as the multiplayer was a dud. I tried it, and only once found enough people playing to get into a game. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

SINGULARITY is a military-based first person shooter set in a sci-fi background. There's a time-travely story revolving around an ""incident"". Your character is basically running around to fix things. There are some inventive weapons, as well as the more-common handgun, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. The graphics are decent. Visually, it reminds of Bioshock;  the environment is predominantly dark and rusty. Also, similarly, you use your left hand for certain special abilities.

These abilities are what make the game more enjoyable, as you can alter time in certain ways, very locally, which makes for some fun kills. The baddies generally fall into two camps: soldiers with a few different weapon load outs, and mutated creatures, humanoid and not, with various abilities and attack styles.

Here's what kills the game:

No saves/limited checkpoints: There's no option to save anywhere. If you die, you get sent back to your last checkpoint. I reloaded a couple times to try and loot certain areas. Even upon completing the game, you cannot replay any chapters, except your last checkpoint. The one time you can replay is the ending. So, you can play all the endings.

Extremely linear game: which seems a little ironic for a time-travel storyline. In any chapter, you're going from point A to point B. Open doors shut behind you, preventing you from back-tracking. There are some very small side trips or rooms to looting options, which are dead ends. You'll walk miles of hallways with endless doors,but the only one that opens in the one that leads to point B. I missed at least one upgrade because I couldn't go back. Also, your special abilities are given at certain chapters, which seems limiting. There are some upgrade options along the way, though.

Special Abilities: Your character has this wacky Time Manipulation Device for most of the game. It can affect creatures/soldiers, and objects. But only some objects, and in the context of the game, not very many. Bummer.

The Multiplayer: Seems like it might be fun, as you can play as human, or mutated thing with abilities. But no one's playing it, so it's hard to say. But half the achievements (for Xbox, anyhow) are locked in multi, which stinks if you care about 'cheevos.

Length: I didn't clock my hours, but I was done with thing in three sittings. Too bloody short.

On the plus side, I got it for ten bucks, and I satisfied my curiousity about this game. But, really, don't bother. Save your time and money for better games.

Thanks for reading. I really don't know how this rates 4+ stars."
2.0	"Exaggerated Gestures do not equal Broadway Dance. The movements in this game do not in any way reflect what went on in the original productions. They are more a suggestion of a movement type. The only workout I got from this game was fatigue from holding my arms up too long. Most of the movement concentrated on swaying the arms to the music with very limited foot and leg work.

The movement is not virgorous enough to cause you to lose much weight and what you do with your right hand determines the score so you don't have to move your feet. Many of the arm movements reminded me of the kind of therapy they did with my father in his nursing home (from a seated position). If you have an elder at home who is in reasonably good health and likes music it could be a fun way for him or her to retain or increase range of motion and interact with the kids. Might be good therapy for some..."
2.0	When I first placed the order, I thought I was getting the full season roster, but I had to pay $4.99 more just to play as Jago alone. This is why I can't stand DLC. Now I have to pay $20.00 more dollars just to get season one and season two. When I first placed the order, I thought I ...
2.0	I've played all the Nancy Drew games and found this to be one of the weaker ones.  The music and graphics were good, but I thought the puzzles were kind of dull and there weren't enough areas to explore.  It was short and lacked the depth of some of the other games.  If you've never played one of these games, I'd recommend Shadow at Waters Edge. Not the strongest ND game
2.0	"this game is okay at first, but then it gets boring. i thought that it would be alright (i must have been kidding myself!). i am up for the new challenges (but not this...). i can't see how this game gets such a high rating...i think it is for kids honestly. i am a kid-at-heart, but i couldn't take this...skating game.
i just hope ""they"" don't make anymore sequels, they should be done
I KNOW I AM!!!!!
RATED TWO BECAUSE SHADED GRAPHICS ARE COOL! JSFR is JUNK"
2.0	I thought VF4: Evolution would be better than the normal VF4, but I was wrong. There's only better graphics, more arenas, and annoying guitar music along with a new mode. The game's addictive at first, but then I wondered why I was wasting my time on it because I ended up dragging myself through playing it. VF4: Evolution does not have a single bit of my recommendation. I thought this would be better than Virtua Fighter 4...
2.0	"This game is mediocre, at best.  It is a fantasy medieval war game with mixes of RPG, Action, and tactics thrown in.  You command a squad of soldiers with certain skills and equipment; and you get to control the leader in combat, hacking up the enemies and doing special moves...

The first few missions were fun and getting to improve the leader and the army was fun as well - but it gets old very fast.  There is very little surprise or innovation on the part of the character development or story progression.  In fact, if you've played other RPG or fantasy games you'll notice the typical formula in this one - which is not bad if you like that style.

The graphics, sound, and performance were great - but it had a modern musical score with electric guitars and hard rock.  Doesn't bother me but it does detract from the flavor of the game.

All said, the game is repetitive early on with very little in the way of excitement to offer.  Players may enjoy the action - if you like button-mashing this is full of it.  The graphics and bloodshed are great and will satisfy the action / gore fanatics out there.

Take care! Medieval Mediocrity"
2.0	"i have recieved two chargers with a 24"" cord, that is even shorter than the one you can get from other game stores. Seriously didn't want to be plastered to the wall to charge the dsi.  Not that thrilled with the length I was wanting the long cord and didn't get that. this picture shows the cord as it came with the dsi but what you get isn't this."
2.0	You know I don't know a lot about this game.  Just thought the kids would like it based on the description.  Unfortunately, I have not known them to use it.  It arrived just fine so happy with the vendor, De blob
2.0	"I purchased these along with a skin for my Xbox 360 controller from Amazon. It was only a few moments after I put the dual shock 4 skin on that I noticed how slippery it was. The controller was so slippery that I had problems holding on to it. I took the skin of and used the controller for a bit, and noticed how much better of a grip that it had without the skin.

Conversely, the Xbox 360 controller skin had a great grip so I left it on.

I don't recommend this product., There are a grip of other skins out there, I wish I knew which ones were not slippery, but I don't. For me, this means I'll buy differently colored controllers instead of trying to use skins.

I doubt it would make economic sense to send these skins back, shipping charges alone would eat up my refund. :( Too Slippery"
2.0	"I could not load this game from disk. I would load the disk, get all the start up stuff, but when it was supposed to ask for the key it would only show the download bar loading very fast then say it was added successfully.  Which it wasn't.  I search forums and EA help but nothing.  Finally got a live person at EA who told me there was something off about the disk.  Luckily, I had downloaded it much earlier and could down load it again from The Sims 3 website.

As for the fame itself, it adds two really pretty worlds.  Unlike the future one, this one offers a lot of cool stuff.  Worth the money Odd problem downloading that could not be explained."
2.0	This game for me is a weak attempt to copy the game 'Tetris'. It just  isn't as fun or challenging as i had hoped. The only plus that i see with this game is that it would be preferred over tetris by children because of the colorful graphics and cartoon look. So if you have children and are looking for a good clean kid friendly game to keep them entertained and expand their hand/eye coordination then this game might be a good choice. Yoshi game
2.0	Is a puzzle game. What more can I write, but write that if you like a different styled 'Tetris' then jump right in. A puzzle game...
2.0	I don't like POPWW as much as POPSOT. It's ok. I think they changed the entire game by focusing too much on the battle system (including a lot of blood).You still have the cool moves like running along the wall but this game reminds me of a shooter game. All fight and nothing else. The first one had a sense of humor, a good story, puzzles, a perfect amount of fighting and a fun side kick. Now you have this ugly obnoxious barely clothed woman that you have to fight through the game and it's really boring. Why do game developers always have to make drastic changes? POP Sands of Time was a great game. If it ain't broke don't fix it. I'm just sorry that I bought it. I should have rented it first. Disappointed
2.0	"The graphics in this game are *gorgeous*.  The formula seems to be a winning one:  half-strategy, half-roleplaying, this takes a typical Blizzard game like StarCraft or WarCraft and turns it on its ear by giving you characters that not only interact through the various chapters' cinematics, but whom you get to control.  Just like Diablo, they have health and mana, and can carry a limited number of items.  Neat!  Now you have one character who can customize his skills, rally the troops, and help you feel more directly immersed in the game, instead of just hovering over the world map.
Now for the problem:  the game mechanics.  While the point-and-click interface works well, the missions I've played don't seem to show any true A.I.  Enemies just hurl themselves at you and the winner is the one with the most firepower:  no careful deployment of archers here, knights there.  Worse yet, the A.I. behind the scenes isn't operating on your level.  You have to build your town, make soldiers, etc.  But your opponent doesn't do the same thing:  enemies appear out of nowhere.  They attack when you do one action, but save, restart and prepare for the attack, and it'll never come.  Why?  Because the troops don't exist until the program decides to throw them at you.  You don't really feel like you're facing an enemy so much as you're playing through a ""choose your own adventure"" scenario.  One wrong choice and it's off to reload.  And most of your choices involve bashing your way through:  on one early mission in the human campaign, your sterling hero turns against his allies and it's your job to help him lead men through a village, slaughtering all the peasants and burning their houses.  Hurrah.  Some enemies might show up to relive the monotony, but it doesn't help when they don't have much in the smarts department. Great Idea, Bad Execution"
2.0	"I bought this as part of the Xbox One bundle. It was a digital download included in my purchase. I have played the Forza series before. I played Forza 2 about 5 years ago and it was fairly entertaining. I remember wasting hours upon hours on that game racing and buying cars. It's pretty much the same formula as it was back then -- except it's not. Let's not start with the bad though.

The graphics are beautiful! The cars look great and the light and shading on everything is just really exceptional.

The loading.
Oh, you will load. You will then load some more. You will race a boring race for about 6 minutes or so. You will load some more and stare at your banged-up car. Then you load some more to go back to loading to load the next race. Repeat this cycle for everything.

The repetition - same car, same map (oh let's reverse it!)
You will likely race one car for about 18 races in a row if you're anything like me. If you're anything like me you will also do them in order. They take you through a series but then there are ""bonus"" races. Guess what? Those are the same maps. You're going to do them again!

The restrictions
You get to choose from about 6-10 cars for each series. In the beginning they definitely suck. You can quickly level your first car to an A class or better, but you can't really race it in anything. You can't go beat the pants off some c-class suckers. No, you have to stay in the limitations of whatever you are racing.

The pay-to-win disease
It took me a bit to come to this realization. I mean there are plenty of silly tricks online to earn easy money and they work I am sure. I just haven't felt the need to do it. However, you can also see that it costs 20 dollars to get ""VIP"" so that you get double money on everything. Really? How lame.
Or you need to buy cars with real money. You have to buy these if you want to be the ""best."" I quote that simply because you are not the best if you are one of a few that have spent money on this game and it allows you get the best times. You are probably still very good, but you are not actually competing against everyone. I only discovered this after I checked the leaderboards on a few races and I found that in the top 100 car A and car B are the only ones there and, hold your breath, they are both available for purchase as DLC!

The art
I like that you can do all kinds of modifications to the style of the vehicles like in Forza 2. I just feel like there is a big part missing. This game needs a companion app that lets you draw in game and really simplifies some of the designs. Maybe give a randomizing feature that grabs art from other areas or combines them. I would like to be able to draw and airbrush and just drag things on my ipad like in my drawing programs. I would like to import things from my photos or whatever. It would be cool.

Why am I still playing it?
I have to admit I am a bit neurotic. I am still doing each race one-by-one and completing them to get the gold trophies and attempting to beat my friends' times. However, after about 80 races you have the review above. I am frustrated with the game and the leaderboards don't mean a thing to me. I mostly focus on beating my friends for each race. I have about 1.3 million credits, but don't spend them on anything because I can't really use the cars on anything yet. You can't modify the crappy cars beyond a certain point or it will change your class. Another Xbox One disappointment for me I suppose. Pay to Win"
2.0	IDK what I thought a cheap arcade stuck would do but just spend the money on a legit stick instead of watering money on this. It's ok.... Would not recommend
2.0	All I have to say bout this game is that it is fun for a couple hours once you get your lightsaber.  There are some fun levels and special effects are great but....  now the con- no real replayability, once I finished it, which didn't take too long, I didn't want to play it again, and the multiplayer isn't much better than the first jedi game... I recommend waiting for Knights of the old republic to come out if you really want to lightsaber duel.  Also Star Wars Galaxies is coming out in January and will be a great online RPG- with space wars and light saber battles. Jedi Nighty night
2.0	Pick up everything you're able to, not that it makes any sense at the moment, but because later on it'll be an item you need to use or combine with something else.  Which made this game a tedious task.  Also the dialogue was awkward at times, out of character (esp Max in Ireland), and soon I was just waiting for some long-winded conversations to take their course.  While the storyline was fine, and I normally like these types of games, glad that I finished this and could delete it. Tedious
2.0	"Don't purchase this expecting to get DLC that is story, they're just trials against the alien.
Wasn't worth the money in retrospect. I probably spent no more than an hour or two with this DLC. Meh"

He insisted on this Train Simulator 3 and he was extremely disappointed and said quote ""It sucks mommy!""  Played it for 3 days. Going to return to Amazon so they can sell it for me. My child said he hates it...."
2.0	"This is not a positive review due to bugs, scripting errors, and random crashes.

I played this game past the 3rd stage.  Unfortunately, I encountered many game ending situations where I would get the freeze screen and have to CNTRL-ALT-DEL out of the game, so I have stopped playing altogether.  I have an up to date system far exceeding any requirement this game can throw at me, yet I get occasional freeze screens and runtime errors.  This digital download is not patched to the latest version so you will have to do so on your own to avoid even more issues.  After downloading the patch, many of these freeze-ups disappeared but I still had game-ending scenarios such as an out-of-memory error (which is strange since my computer has 8 gigs of memory).

The ARMA2 interface is a bit antiquated.  It utilizes text driven menus selected by the mouse wheel then confirmed by the primary mouse button.  Unfortunately the same mouse button is used to shoot people.  I found myself unintentionally shooting people quite a bit.

On the 3rd stage, you have an open-ended mission in which you are free to explore the entire game map and follow any objective you wish.  Unfortunately, you are given a multitude of locations to search, some 20-30 kms of seperating distance... yet the game forces an impossible time limit of one hour to complete your objectives.  Your objectives are simply too vague to perform a 100% playthrough of the map.

This stage also introduces helecopter insertions and extractions at will.  Some of the objectives require you to travel great distances, so I found the chopper rides to be the best part of the game.  Unfortunately, there were several drawbacks- one of which is a game ender.  I had to go online to look up the instructions for calling the chopper since there is no in-game training.  Now the game-ender: the chopper will destroy itself if it hits a tree, even slightly so- during takeoff or landing.  The path the chopper takes during these maneuvers is not a gradual, careful descent/ascent; it is more like a haphazard diagonal from the sky to the ground, which will end up hitting anything in the way.  The game map is about 80% tree cover, which means this is a huge problem in general for large portions of the map.  I blew up about 8 choppers in this way on just this map alone.  There were situations where I would select an area completely devoid of trees, yet the chopper would still make the most unrealistic diagonal across the sky and smash into a tree standing 50 meters away out in the middle of nowhere.  Since this always happens during normal gameplay, surely the devs would have noticed this for the past couple years after release?  It's so hit-or-miss that I find myself saving the game prior to an evac command.

Then... the scripting errors.  Occasionally one of your squad NPC's will not respond to commands and stand still like a statue.  The helecopter also suffers from this syndrom at times by hovering in the air completely inaccesible to you, no matter how many times you call for an evac.  I played the open-ended map several times on the 3rd stage, yet was surprised that one NPC would not provide the mission-oriented dialogue at the appropriate point in the game.  Thankfully I knew what to do since I had played numerous times before (due to reasons mentioned already), yet I think a person playing for the first time would be completely confused and not know where to go.  These are all game-enders.

Overall I find the game buggy, the coding inadequate.  I tried working around these issues by saving frequently, yet the random crashes prevent me from enjoying the game anyway.

2.0	"Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs. Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game.
As far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation.
As far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw.
As far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it.
The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do.
And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it.
Overall this game is the worst of  the BoF series. I don't recommend buying it unless its finishes some  collection you are working on, or if you have to see a hopping onion follow  people around. Just didn't meet my expectations."

2.0	"First off, when I heard MOO3 was coming out, I was excited.  More excited because the rumor was that if MOO3 was successful a Master of Magic 2 might be developed.
I read all the horrible reviews that everyone wrote, and thought to myself, ""Hey, I loved MOO, MOO2, MOM, Civ2"" and just about every other turn based strategy game out there.  I'll have to like this.  I figured all the negative reviews were just by people who get frustrated by complexity.
The game is complex.  VERY complex.  I consider myself a pretty intelligent guy.  I'm college educated.  I've been playing strategy games for a long time.  I have no clue the the [F-Bomb] is going with the economics and research aspects of the game.  I'm sure a lot of time and effort went into developing this side of the game, but personally, I find US Income Taxes much easier to understand than this.
I've put in about 6 hours of game playing and I'm pretty much giving up.  I kept thinking that I'm missing something and the game will get fun after just 10 or 20 more turns.  The game just isn't fun.  I don't mind playing for an hour to get into the game to get the challenge going (Getting setup in CIV and developing Cities takes time for the later battle).  But the game is just missing the fun aspect.

2.0	"Graphics: 5/10 - The colour shading is nice when you're playing outside, but for the rest of the time, this looks pretty effortless and droopy. It's also hard to see where a passage leads.
Sound: 5/10 - The usual cartoon racing score hangs in the background, while the cars don't do anything too dramatic with their engines.
Value: 5/10 - Most racing games are worth the money because they're entertaining, but to make a long story short, this one isn't really worth paying for unless you're a really big fan of the muppets.
Overall: 5/10 - This is the sort of game you play in the game or record store while your waiting for Mum to finish her grocery shopping. In a game where you can hardly see where you're going, is it worth even playing? Yes, but only if Mum takes a couple of hours to find a broccoli stick.

2.0	"Shooting in this game is one of the most refined I have ever played. the graphics are incredible, but....

If the game was just about shooting forward and watching the bullets hit it would be a 10.

Unfortunately the game suffers.

There is no story what so ever, the acting is about as poor as I have ever seen. Most noticeable is that when your fighting the AI just continue to pop out of the ground indefinitely, for ever. You can shoot at them all you want and they will keep popping up out of the ground, you could shoot 100,000 AI and it would make no difference.

The ending of the game relies so heavily on re spawning it makes you think ""what where they thinking during the 5 years of production"".

There is no climax to this game, each level is the same, 5 guys pop up and come towards you, the next scene, 5 guys pop up and come towards you, that is it. That is all there is to it. You have a brief moment in a tank that controls like an awkward mess. Each level is almost exactly the same with a different background.

What makes this game more disappointing is that it took them 5 years to make it and this is all they could come up with.

Its more based on you walking forward than defeating the enemy. You will enjoy picking it up and shooting, but will likely get bored once you realize it doesn't make much difference how many guys you kill, they just keep popping up and just running forward isn't much for strategy.

Adding some vehicles, story, acting, some variations and cut out all the res pawning, this game could have been in the upper 9's.

Killzone 2 REVIEW SCORE = 7.6

Rental (7.6) Review - Killzone 2 - ""Dissapointing""."
2.0	Boring game and idea. Couldn't hold my son's attention or any kid that came in contact with it. I wouldn't buy again. Boring game and idea
2.0	"There is nothing about the multiplayer aspect in this review;  Multiplayer has no appeal to me.  I'm in the middle of ""Changing Tides"", the apparent fifth level.  I've taken the disc out of the tray and put it back in the box and it will remain there forever, in penance, to think about what it has done in darkened silence.  Danger Close and EA should be ashamed of this pile of garbage.

I played the Medal of Honor reboot/release, the single player campaign, and it was good.  I enjoyed it.  The pacing, the action, the story, all of it was good.  It wasn't perfect, but it was a good purchase and time well spent.  I thought Warfighter would be the same.  Good gravy, was I wrong.  So wrong.

Beyond the fact that the levels are very corridor-like and cramped, they are too dark.  I don't have room on my drive to install the ""HD graphics"", so I'm using whatever the default stuff is -- but the color pallet is washed out and the shading is too aggressive.  I had to turn my brightness up to see what was happening a lot of the time.  The game is an endless series of high pressure zero notice pop-up shooting gallery pieces punctuated by trying to navigate an obvious corridor or a confusing environment.  ""What in the world is happening??"" has been my most common thought.

I've done one of the driving levels...  that is some total nonsense right there.  Man, I don't know how anyone thought that level was well done.  After an excessively long and frustrating chase scene I had one single chance to pilot that careening piece of garbage vehicle with terrible controls into a single spot, or else I had to restart from the last checkpoint NO PREACHER NO YOU LOST HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This game feels like Call of Duty: World at War got smashed into a trash can with Medal of Honor: Airborne, and then that trash was formed into a new game which was sold to me through Amazon.  Endless guys, invisible spawn lines, a terrible ""cover/peek"" system, and lots of HURRY UP RUSH HURRY UP RUSH GO GO GO complete with your idiot squad mates haranguing you about taking too long.

Please, please, please:  Rent this game.  Do not purchase it unless you've played it for a bit.  I wish I had not, it was a complete waste.  Purchased or played it, that is.  I essentially paid for about an hour and a half of frustration with zero enjoyment. Astonishingly disappointing, a mistake to purchase"
2.0	I just spent five hours of my life playing this game leveling my favorite character up. And I turned off my xbox after saving my progress of course only to find my data is gone and I'm back to level 1 come to find out on the 360 this game will delete your saves whenever your console is off. So save yourself the head ache and go for the ps2 version and get extreme legends while your at it. Your save data will get deleted on the 360.
2.0	was not a 64 mb memory card was in fact a 8 mb card it was not good.
2.0	"This is a pretty lame product, especially for something that appears to be well-designed.

Initially, I was impressed by its design, mainly because it fits the PS4 seamlessly via clamps on either side that slide right onto the unit, and connects to its power port. It even has a nice slant to fit the parallelogram profile of the system. On the right side, there is a big fan for its larger section, and then 2 small fans on the thin side that sits under the system's other ports.

The Intercooler connects to the system's power port, and thus receives power from the same cord, and passes through power to the system. This is a nice setup as the fans will thus turn on/off with your system activity.

Normally, all of this would seem awesome, except the accessory is clearly cheaply made.

Fans should either have a temperature sensor to detect when to increase or decrease RPM based on the system's heat output, or have a max RPM that is reasonable for its common use. However, when you initially turn this on, the fans spin-up to an obnoxiously high level, and then settle at a point that isn't far below that starting max. While it runs, the fans are constantly very, very loud, making this especially annoying if all you end up doing is watching a show. Honestly, I have built PCs, and in my experience, no healthy fan should be making sounds like that. Keep in mind, because it turns on/off with the system, it's no longer a simple choice of when to use it.

In the end, the product is, to me, not worth the expense or the hassle from the noise. The PS4 normally doesn't run very warm, and as long as you keep it in a decently ventilated area, it should keep itself appropriately cool. Obviously, keeping it in a super cramped space isn't a good idea. If you feel that you maintain it in an area, or environment that is constantly warmer than you are comfortable with, purchase a small, table stand-fan to prop nearby it and blow warm air away. I feel this would be a cheaper, quieter solution for your issue.

2/5 for a good design, but losing out on every other aspect of its functionality. Clever design, poor execution and way too loud"
2.0	"This is frankly a waste of money. It barely works, and isn't any bigger than the battery in the controller itself.
You charge the bank, then plug it into the controller. Then when your controller starts to die, you hit the power button on the battery bank and hope it charges your controller - which it seems to do a crappy job at.
And if you need to charge your controller while it's on, you have to take it off; there's no passthrough for charging.
Plus the size makes gripping the controller or pulling triggers quite uncomfortable.

Just use a normal smartphone battery bank and you'll be much better off. What a waste."
2.0	I was pretty excited for this game.  The game is definitely not worth $60.  Pretty barebones multiplayer.  Maps are too big for 6vs6 action.  You run around all the time and hardly run into another player.  You shoot more bots than players.  And is it just me or is there no leaderboard?  A full blown multiplayer and there is no leaderboard?  What is this madness.  No way to choose maps either.  Very very limited customization which is a joke. This game got boring and got boring quick.  I see myself going back to battlefield 4.  This game is a whole bunch of meh.  Such a shame and a letdown.  Total hype.  And again, seriously, wait for a big price drop if you want to buy it.  I can only imagine the bare bones multiplayer will only get slightly better with endless amounts of dlc.  I'm seriously almost done with the gaming industry in general.  It's gone to sh. One more thing, I didn't check the publisher before purchasing.  If I knew it was EA I'd have run the other way. These high ratings are really suspect. This game is absolutely nothing special.  Pick up plants vs zombies or peggle instead. Boring
2.0	Everything the others say about this game is accurate.  It is a driving simulator, your car never gets scratched, the AI in the game is lacking, etc.  So, if you want a driving simulator, buy this game because it is fun to compare the cars on the race tracks.  There is at least one race that seems impossible, and this impossible requirement brings the fun level down.  i don't mind trying 20 times to win a race which requires me to really examine every turn, but forcing me to drive that Suzuki Cappuccino in a race against better cars starting from the 16th position - gimme a break.  Challenging I don't mind.  Next to Impossible is just too disappointing to be fun. It's all true
2.0	"I played this game before its prequel: Path of Radiance for the Gamecube.
In the beginning the story and characters seemed uninspiring, the dialogue wooden and juvenile. How could anyone care for the Dawn Brigade? Leonardo, Edward, Nolan, so shockingly poor characters do I seldom see. Also the whole presentation seemed flawed. Outdated graphics, unmemorable music, bad voice-acting, still pictures and lifeless images.
Little by little I grew into the game, and after a while I was no longer bothered by the things which I mentioned. The story, characters and dialogue all improved as the game moved on, particularily in part III.
A new to the series, the game felt immensely difficult at times, but it was mostly for not thinking ahead and trying to move too fast. On second playthrough even hard/maniac mode is a piece of cake.

However, only after playing Path of Radiance, and then starting this game again, do I see how lackluster this game actually is. A pity they coulnd't build better on the foundation laid by the prequel. Dull, after playing  Path of Radiance"
2.0	This battery dies a lot quicker then my rechargeable. I got it because i could still use my good controller even when the batteries were dead because of the chord but it's annoying that i'm a casual gamer who plays at the most 2 hrs a day and the battery dies every day! At one point it is useful but at another point... Wtf? O_o Bad battery life but useful
2.0	"I really wanted to love this game, but handling felt yuk, fast cars didn't feel so fast as TDU1, and the bugs...

now, perhaps in 6 months this game gets really good... Sad"
2.0	"I have every game in the franchise, I've been on Initiates since day one and I love AC. I was so damn excited when I got the game only to be utterly disappointed by Ubisoft.

A) STORY  3/10, feels like they didn't even try but hey, at least there's a story

The story is just terrible. There are three elements an AC game has to have because they're so deeply ingrained in the franchise:

1. present day story
2. First Civ/PoEs story
3. historical story

Unity ditches the first and second points almost completely in favor of the historical plot, which is not that great and it's pretty much a copy paste from AC2. Arno himself is best described as Ezio 2.0 with maybe a little bit of Edward's sass and Connor's anger management issues. It gets so bad it doesn't feel like an AC game at all. Rogue delivers much greatly and it has a better balance between present day, First Civ and historical stories, if you want to play a true AC game this year, play Rogue.

B) GAMEPLAY  8.9/10, has it's flaws but I love it

My only/main complaints are:

1. I only had two glitches, one when I got trapped inside the statue I was trying to climb and another when the cinematic wouldn't advance, I had to restart the game both times.
2. No human shield or whistling option
3. NPCs don't look for you in haystacks anymore
4. Combat is way freaking hard (but that may be that I was never very good at combat to begin with)
5. I don't like having to ""buy"" skills. I should be able to perform double assassinations and air assassinations from the second I get the hidden blade
6. Can't use hidden blade in combat

At the end, these are small things but really bother me, but I love gameplay overall. Free running is more fluid and parkour down is great

C) GRAPHICS  9/10, loved them

Now, I loved the graphics. A lot of people will complain about this, but I found no flaw in the graphics. Mo-cap is very well done and it's nicely synced to the voice acting (which is also great), and that added a lot to the experience. Cutscenes are more fluid and characters don't look like robots when interacting which each other.

D) FINAL VEREDICT  2/5 or 5.6/10

As I mentioned, it doesn't feel like an AC game. It's very flawed but it has very good things. I haven't tried co-op or most of the side missions because I'm just way too disappointed with Unity (and I'm very busy playing Rogue). If you are a hardcore AC fan, you'll obviously get it no matter what I say; if you are a casual AC fan, watch it on youtube; if you have never played an AC, get Rogue and not this game. from an AC die hard fan - PS4"
2.0	"I had some issues with the BOOM MIC and was/am not able to find a place to purchase a new BOOM MIC CABLE. The BOOM MIC CABLE broke almost instantly, within two weeks of use the cable started to make popping noises in the right side and just finally died and all sound is lost in the right side.

I wrote a review on PLANTONICS website for this headset and they immediately deleted it because i complained that they do not have a section to purchase replacement parts for there gaming head phones but they have replacement parts for every other device they sell. I found that disturbing and it has completely turned me off to plantonics. That they would go so far as to delete someones honest review of there product.

Plantonics customer service is not very good at all. I do NOT recommend these headphones. Save up forty more dollars and buy a Turtle Beach or some other reliable brand. These Plantonic headphone cables are poorly built and tear inside too easily. I did enjoy it at first BUT THEN"
2.0	I've been a fan of the NCAA series for the past 5 years. I owned last year's version on the original Xbox and thought it was great.  Now that I've moved to the 360, it feels like the game has regressed (except in the graphics area). There are too many bugs and problems and it really seems like the game was rushed to meet the shipping date. I think it would have been a lot better if extra time were taken to test and work out the kinks.  The basic gameplay is still good but the number of interceptions is completely insane. I found I can beat any player on-line by not throwing any passes while my opponent will usually have 5 or more interceptions. Since I don't even take control of the DBs, it's totally the game's AI that's doing it. I hope that next year's version can iron out these problems as it will be the 3rd year on the 360 and blaming being on a new platform won't be a valid argument anymore.  With all this being said, I wouldn't recommend skipping the game since it's still plays well overall, but I would be prepared for a number of annoyances and frustrations. Decent game but too many flaws
2.0	really cheap. poor quality
2.0	"If you like solitaire, you'll like this; if you prefer hidden object games (HOGs), you'll be disappointed.

This game has several rounds of solitaire for each HOG played. It's difficult, but not impossible, to lose at solitaire, so it may be the ultimate in casual gaming. In fact, it was a bit too lucky for my preference; I usually prefer a bit more challenge in my games.

The solitaire is of the card-matching type, where you have to uncover underlying cards similarly to Mah Jong.

The cards for solitaire were very large and easy to see and suitable for a considerable degree of vision loss; hidden object games are, by their nature, a bit of a toss-up in that regard. The game is quite well-suited for hearing loss, however. OK if you like solitaire. Fine for hearing and vision impaired"
2.0	Mouse was faulty within a few months. I also preferred the shape of other mice Two Stars
2.0	I got this game and it wasn't an original case it was just in a plastic clear CD case I was hoping to get and it's regional case and booklet but I didn't so I'm not really happy but the main thing is the game place but I'm going to try to buy it again from someone else who has the book in the case. Not happy with it
2.0	"As many video gamers can attest, all the way back to the horrible abomination that was E.T for the Atari 2600 (given only a 6 week window to program, it was certain this game would fail, and indeed around 2M are rumored to have been buried in a US desert), movie video games typically aren't very good.

This is also one of those games.

Admittingly, I was looking for some cheaper games at first for my PS3, and I would probably never have bought this game otherwise.  Still I wanted to give it a try.

The graphics/cutscenes are the best part of this game, as they should be on a PS3 system.  The gameplay pretty much borrows from its predecessors (complete puzzle, having to use a specific character, complete specific tasks, mash this button, etc).  You can find many other games (the Ratchet and Clank series, for one) that does what Prince Caspian tries to do much, much better.

Graphics:  9/10  You'll definitely feel like you're in the movie with the graphics, for better or worse

Sound:  7/10  Standard fare for a game of this type; nothing memorable

Gameplay:  2/10  Pretty much the same thing you've seen 1000's of times before

Replay Value:  1/10  Not too many reasons to play this game again after you've beaten it.

So, if you're a huge Prince Caspian/Narnia fan, you will probably love the game.  Otherwise, you'd be best to take your $10-15 down to a Game Stop and find a different game. If you're not a Narnia fan, just steer clear, you've seen this before..."
2.0	"I've waited so long for this title and had such high hopes for it.  If you're not going to be playing MP don't even consider buying this game.  The ""missions"" and survival modes basically put you in one area where you just basically shoot at each other and see who gets the most kills.  That's it. Nothing else. There is no kind of character development or any other depth to this game.  Its a shame because the game engine looks like it has a lot of potential but it just seems like the development of this title was rushed and nobody at EA really cared and just banked on the hype surrounding this title to sell copies. I played it a few times hoping I was missing something but it got completely boring after the first twenty minutes of play time.  Hopefully at some point EA can leverage the game engine on this and release an actual game with a campaign mode or at least something with an ounce of substance. This is a total fail and I'm only giving it two stars because its graphically stunning but that's all it has going for it. What a shame"
2.0	Absolutely not. There is almost nothing to like about this title other than its colorful, almost Ratchet and Clank-like visuals. There is almost nothing to like about this title other than its colorful

2.0	"I won't lie to you, Saints Row IV is a VERY fun game. But... if you are looking for a new Saints Row with new features, then look elsewhere. I am utterly beside myself, on one hand I know that it is terrible and on the other hand I know that I am having SUCH a fun time when I play this game. In terms of what you'd expect out of a ""new game"", Saints Row IV has NOTHING, no new features worth mentioning nor anything that you could call a decent story. Let's go over a few things that made Saints Row what it is (was). The plot device (you being president) is just that, and not even done well at all. The story (aliens putting people in a matrix environment), would suck completely if not for the fact that there ARE some entertaining moments in the story. The improvements, ugh, I can't even CALL them that. Simply put, get Grand Theft Auto V if you want something more sophisticated. Tons of fun, but still terrible..."
2.0	item only works sometimes Two Stars
2.0	"Buyer beware, the GAME DOESN""T WORK.

I love C&C and once you get this game working, it's awesome to play the old favorites again. However, this game runs using Origin and the games do not start. If they do start, they will have invisible menus, among other issues. To get these games working you need moderate computer skills, or good reading skills to follow directions from online forums.

When I first started this game, I had problems installing Generals. I had to uninstall and reinstall several times for no apparent reason. Once the games were finally installed (by pure luck), I started playing my old favorite, Tiberium Sun. As soon as the game was up and running, my menu was invisible. I could start a basic skirmish, but couldn't see any of the options menus.

With Generals, the game just wouldn't even start. I eventually did what you will need to do if you buy this game. Search online for the solution. Luckily there are a few forums with people who posted solutions. The fix I found required downloading a file from a stranger, then copying/pasting files into the game directory, along with applying minor changes to the start shortcuts, etc.

After hours of work, I finally got C&C working. Now I can play them and enjoy them, and they are a ton of fun. But if you don't want to take a gamble by buying a broken game, don't buy this. Broken game, requires work to get running"
2.0	"*Disclaimer: Even though this game was released in 2009, I am reviewing this game according to my present standards, for the benefit of someone who hasn't played this game before and is looking to play older titles.

CONCEPT:
Cole was just a courier in Empire City until he became an unwilling scapegoat when a package he was delivering turned out to be a bomb, a bomb unlike any other seen before. Aside from causing mass casualties and destruction, Cole was imbued with strange powers--specifically, to be able to absorb and control electric energy and use it at his disposal. The bomb has also created a sickness that prompts the government to quarantine Empire City indefinitely. With riots and lawlessness in the streets, Cole decides to use his new powers to clean up the streets and find out who was behind his framing him for a terrorist. How me plans on achieving those goals is up to the player.

GRAPHICS/SOUND:
The graphics are on par with what was being released during that year, if not maybe a little rough here and there. Empire City looks  the absolute same regardless of what part of the map you are in; generic skyline, building structure, etc. Using Cole's super powers is pretty cool to look at, but that's really it, as far as what stands out. The music and overall sound of the game is pretty solid, although the dialog is very cliche and hokey throughout. I find this terribly annoying in some games, and InFamous is no exception: putting effort into making the main character look good (graphics-wise), then obviously half-assing it for every other NPC in the game, whether or not they are part of the plot. I can understand when it's done for NPC's that are there to simply populate the game, but the actual characters that Cole interacts with on a regular basis look horrible, sound lame, and their movements are clunky and robotic. If I were to guess, I'd say that whatever code was used for their movements was taken straight out of the first Resident Evil.

GAMEPLAY:
For me, this is where the game really suffers, and I apologize in advance if I start going off on a tangent. Character movement of Cole is very rigid and non-organic, and the horrible camera function just exacerbates the issue; often swooping around during mid-jump and throwing off your perspective. Scaling buildings is extremely frustrating and not nearly as fluid and ""organic"" as the makers claim it is. Oftentimes when I would try to climb something like an electric post or jump onto a ladder against a wall, the character would constantly jump right past it  over and over again until I had to position the character RIGHT IN FRONT of what I was trying to climb and finally he would interact with it appropriately. Cole needlessly climbs things that you didn't need him to climb, which causes a lot of headache when you're being shot at by a mounted machine gun and instead of hopping down to get behind cover, your character wants to skip from mailbox to mailbox, right in the firing line. Oh and that reminds me: if there is one thing that Cole is good at, it's dying. Even when leveled up completely, Cole loses health and dies with some serious regularity when being shot at, which is odd for a character that can jump off a 30 story building without a scratch. Oh yes, and despite him essentially being a living electric conduit with voltage running through his entire body, being too close to one of your own ELECTRIC ""grenades"" results in death. Death always results in you being transported back to a single re-spawn point in the map until you unlock more medical centers, where you will just spawn to the one closest to where you died.

Other than the above mentioned shortcomings, the gameplay is pretty basic: open-world map where you can choose various missions to take part in and complete. As you finish some missions, you will be rewarded with new power-ups for your special skills. Other missions you complete with make the zone the job was in ""safe"" and no more enemies will pop up there. Mission types break down into 3 categories: Good, Neutral, and Bad--pretty self explanatory. A lot of like Fable before it and many other titles since, InFAMOUS allows you to choose missions and/or make decisions that determine your moral compass, and how other characters perceive you. Some power-ups are only available for a really ""Good"" character, and likewise for anyone who dedicates themselves to being a right prick to pretty much everyone. Aside from balancing out your goodness/evilness, the missions are a bit repetitive at times.

REPLAY VALUE:
If you're like me, I always like to play as the good guy on the first run, then be an outright tyrant the second time around. Unfortunately, the hang-ups on gameplay are something that can be quite tiring, so I would give this a moderate/low replay value.

OVERALL:
Video games have improved so drastically over the last few years that some just get left in the dust compared to others. InFAMOUS is a title that gathered enough momentum to warrant two more games under it's umbrella, so obviously it's not the total failure I may have made it out to be. Like my disclaimer states, I critiqued this game based on my present standards because very few video games could be considered ""timeless"", and InFAMOUS to me, isn't one of them. It's not a great game, but it's not unplayable either. If you want to play the sequel and Second Son (which looks amazing), then it stands to reason that the plots would make more sense and the feel would be more genuine if you start from game one. Another thing worth noting is that I experienced absolutely ZERO glitches, which is a bragging right that a lot of the bigger and more successful game companies have NEVER had. Pretty rough around the edges..."
2.0	Civ III is much anticipated and I would say quite disapointing.  Civ II had a number of unballanced aspects (howitzers that won ever engagement and railroads that allowed instant transport to name a few).  However, it was a good simulation of cultural development.  Civ III lacks many of the key technological improvements of Civ II (no rail so you always use the same roads that you built in 3000 BC and no improvments in agriculture) that makes the game less fun.  They should have made the game more ballanced but still kept the flow of history that made it great before. Not as good as Civilization II
2.0	This game is not nearly as enjoyable on a gaming system as it is on a smartphone or ipad.  Stick to mobile platform. better on a mobile platform
2.0	This product was lacking where it counted most. Although this keyboard has a solid build it lacks where it should count, the lack of brighter lights where the letter on the keyboard could barely be seen even in a lite room. Other than that, this would be one solid keyboard  for the money. You have the feel of a top high quality keyboard that would be affordable. I returned it and got a different LED Keyboard made by the same company. Poor back lighting for the keybord keys.
2.0	"While wireless controllers are a nice idea, sometimes proper quality parts are not used in order to save money. I recently got one of these as part of a Rock Band package (PS2 version of game, drums, guitar, mic).

Pros:
-The guitar has a nice size and weight to it.
-It came with batteries, a rare thing.
-On-Off switch, excellent for maximizing battery life.
-The fret buttons click loudly.
-The strum bar doesn't click, good if you don't like the clickiness of the strum bar on Guitar Hero controllers.
-No cord.

Cons:
-For the tilt/overdrive function to work you need to tilt the controller very vertical, very quickly, if you don't get it up enough, quickly enough, it can't tell that you've tilted it.
-The fret buttons click loudly.
-The strum bar doesn't click, bad if you like the clickiness of the strum bar on Guitar Hero controllers.
-The wireless isn't great, it drops a note every so often while playing. I do not have an interference issue, as my regular wireless controllers work fine. I know it's dropping a note when a note doesn't get played that I know I defiantly hit, or when a hold down note drops off halfway through while I'm still holding the button down.
-The console dongle is a little box with a 3 inch USB cable, when I plug it in I then have to find someplace to put the thing so it's not just dangling of the front of the console.

After having this controller drop 5-10 notes in a song I went back to playing with the original wired red Guitar Hero guitar, with a controller extension cable. I get the same freedom of range as the wireless controller, with no dropped notes.

2.0	I ended up giving it away to a kid who had a DS.  The Harvest Moon on the game cube has been the only decent harvest moon.  They need to bring that one back. This game was annoying
2.0	"Pros:
*Its a gundam game
*Decent Graphics
*RPG-style gear customization system
*Mobile Suit Combat is fairly fun.

Cons:
*No check point system -you wouldn't think this would be to big of an issue, but it is when you just spent 20+ minutes going through a mission only to be confronted with a boss fight and die. Then you have to replay the ENTIRE level again.
*Mobile suit weapons don't interact with the mobile suit at all. They just magically appear and disappear.
*No impact within environment. Your mobile suit just passes through trees. When a building gets hit its untouched.

I'm sure the story is great, but its in japanese. (Which I new when I bought it) All-in-all the language barrier isn't to big of an issue. The lack of savepoints turns this game from fun to more of a chore to play at times. Its... Okay"
2.0	"These headphones didn't really deliver and were quite disappointing.

FOR GAMING
I hoped to use these for my PS3 and wanted to put them up against their equally-priced brother, the wireless Sony headphones I normally use.  While setup isn't terrible, it requires the use of the RCA jack cable that came with my Playstation.  Needless to say, in the eight years or so I've had my PS3, I've managed to lose this cord and rendering them useless.  I plugged the USB jack into the front USB port thinking that maybe I'd just lose my microphone or something, but no dice.  So unless you have that cord (and I know many do), these can't be used right out of the box.

AS HEADPHONES
I'm a bit of an audiophile and I had some hope for these as regular headphones.  Sure, I didn't expect them to deliver against my $500+ pairs, but I have plenty of headphones across ranges that should give these a run.  The sound was very unbalanced -- almost tinny -- and any user listening for a prolonged amount of time will likely suffer from ear fatigue.  Quite disappointing.

CONSTRUCTION
Finally, the construction.  These are all plastic and have a cheaper look to them, cheaper than the pricetag would lead you to believe.  It seems like they'd be durable, but they just don't do it for me.  Also, the ear pads are quite stiff, constantly sending my glasses askew.

In the end, I can't recommend these for the price.  The Sony ones I put them up against deliver better performance and have virtual surround, a key component for gaming.  These headphones did not impress.

I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review. Poor performance for the price"
2.0	"I buy madden every other year and this year is by far the worst.

I live for dynasty mode. This years falls far short.

There is no fantasy draft.

The controls are quite cumbersome. If you want to make a trade, they won't tell you right then and there. You have to return to the main screen only to see that they denied you. Trades are nearily impossible

You can not edit players positions or #s. This is problematic given that I drafted a RT to play RG and I couldn't make him a RG in the depth chart nor could I change his position. Not all that realistic.

The game play is ok if you can get used to players behaving like they stepped on landmines when they bump into their own players.

Overall this seems like a step back and not a move forward. I wish I wouldve read these reviews prior to purchasing. I do not play online. I play for dynasty mode"
2.0	"So let me start by saying, I am a HUGE Bethesda fan. From Fallout 2 to skyrim. I have thoroughly enjoyed Morrow mind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.
This is NOT and Elder Scrolls game, regardless of what the title says. This is a FP-MMO-RPG. For a next gen game the graphics are awful, not the worst I've seen in my life, but defiantly not indicative of a next gen title. Every door opened is another loading screen. There is no way to put away your weapon, aside from ""interacting"" with an object or person. The combat is something I would imagine would have been inventive in the first months of PS3 & XBox 360, but after playing titles Like The Witcher 3 and Dragon age inquisition, this seems like a rip-off.

Graphics : Im not saying the graphics are bad, it just reminds me of oblivion. When you ""open"" a door, your hand kind of waves in front of the screen and the door moves ever so slightly, then it's a loading screen. Oh yes EVERY door leads to a loading screen.
Now the loading times aren't that bad, considering there are a LOT of them i'd say that's a good thing.

Character creation is pretty good but superficial at best. No matter what character you choose, it's the same quests, your character is not treated any different whether your an Orc, Kahjit, or Nord, ike Bethesda has done in the past.
The class system is ok, but not anywhere near indicative of true Bethesda.
Quests are linear, There is nothing about the story that grabs you. This is an MMO, and to be honest, after playing 30 hours or so on ESO, I can confidently say  it's basically World Of Warcraft, well not basically, it IS WoW just with first person.
Honestly I am an RPG fanatic, I love Bethesda's game, I own all of them to date.
But this game is just awful, and I can't believe Bethesda is making folks pay a $60 price tag for this.
I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, even as a prank. It's a total waste of money, bad graphics, awful voice acting, uninteresting and linear quest lines with no investment to care what the NPC's are even saying. All in all a massive fail.
On a positive note if your an MMO fan you'll love this brand spanking new version of World Of Warcraft...er....Elder Scrolls? Not Good at All"

2.0	my 6 year old got bored with it very quickly for younger kids
2.0	"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance was a fantastic game.  It managed to pull characters from the breadth of the Marvel (and technically the Ultimate Marvel) universe together for an epic adventure which took place in its own history and world.  You didn't have to be a comic fan to appreciate the game, but it helped, and the controls were simple.  The worst part of the game, arguably, was that specific costumes you might want your characters to wear gave bonuses you didn't want, or that the power sets were too broad.

I was excited for M:UA2, despite the fact that it takes one of the hands-down worst storylines of Marvel as its template for action, despite having an epic lead-in to a cosmic mash-up following the previous game.  So, instead of having a potentially cosmic and epic issue, instead you have a game predicated entirely around the ""reality"" of superheroics and almost nonsensical choices given the history of a comic-book universe.

In almost every way, I found this game to be inferior to the previous one, though there are areas which would arguably be easier for players to handle.  Let me go through the points quickly.

1) Storyline is hit-or-miss depending on your preferences.  After the epic scale of the previous game, this one was at least a little disappointing.  In the previous game, you went across the Universe and into Asgard, home of the Gods.  In this one, you get to go to New York and ... um ... a Prison which could've actually been anywhere aside from the Negative Zone (where it's located) because you don't see anything but a boring prison interior.

2) Hero selection is generally common-fare.  You get most people's favorites, and some key storyline characters (arguably) like Penance and Songbird.  Frankly, for all the storyline good they did me, I would've rather had Hawkeye, Cyclops, Magneto, Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange, or Moon Knight ... and if you're looking for the awesome costume array from the first one, too bad, each character only gets one, and arguably, not a single alternate favorite in the bunch (i.e. no Black-Suit Spidey, no Grey Hulk, no War Machine or Ultimate Iron Man - not even the Silver IM Movie suit, but a clunky-looking version of his classic armor.)  Also, unlike M:UA, it doesn't matter who you pick, you don't get to select and customize your teams like in the previous version (spending experience to improve their teamwork and collective bonuses), but rather get ""medals"" which can be next-to-useless (Ooh, +10% fire damage ... that's great for the Torch and ... ummm ... why am I spending one slot for that?)

3) Power selection is simplified.  I actually applaud this somewhat, as it puts some basic powers in easy reach at the start, something that M:UA didn't always do.  However, each character only gets 4 powers, meaning that you have much less customization ability.  This isn't a bad thing for most players, but it makes managing your own powers relatively pointless.  Since you get XP so easily in this game, and only 4 powers, just let the computer level you and worry about hitting the ""X"" button 1000 times.

4) AI.  The Boss Fights in M:UA and M:UA2 are both pretty rough, considering some of the second-stringers you're dealing with.  I don't care how powerful you claim Electro's become, when faced with Spider-Man, Iron Man, Cap and Wolverine, he's got about as much lifespan as a candle in a monsoon.  But that's par for the course in these games.  What makes it worse is that the dumbed-down AI of M:UA (from X-Men legends where you can actually make people hang back) where you need to direct your forces with general commands is turned utterly stupid.  You no longer have control of your allies, but rather they run straight into high-damage boss attacks or groups of foes where they get torn apart.  While a greater abundance of healing in this over the previous game mitigates that somewhat, it's still frustrating to find your allies unconscious simply because you didn't stupidly charge with the rest of them.

5) Cutscenes.  In M:UA you were treated to epic cutscenes like an over-powered Doom defeating heroes and reshaping the world, Loki attacking Asgard with mutated berserkers, and Nightcrawler's heroic fight in Castle Doom.  In M:UA2 you get to watch high-contrast static images as if you were watching a cheaply-done news report and heroes picking up trash after a battle.  Wow.

In all, M:UA2 is probably better to get if it's your first time playing an Ultimate Alliance game.  It does all the basics and has slightly more interactivity, but the world seems smaller, gritter and less heroic.  If you've already played M:UA, you're not missing anything by skipping this except the chance for plaing a few new faces (like Gambit and Juggernaut.)  If you want a real epic hero experience, get M:UA and let M:UA2 pass you by. Marvel: Disappointment"
2.0	I personally did not like the game and couldn't continue past the first episode.  I see so many people get persecuted because they think it sucks.  Well, so do I and everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I love the new King's Quest and Valiant hearts.  I loved the LucasArts and Sierra adventure games. Telltale (aside from Monkey Island remake) just lacks all the things that made those games great.  The games are boring, ugly, have terrible voice acting, sound, and lack any sort of charm (Also tried Back to the future and Jurassic Park with same result).  To call this thing Game of the Year is like calling a Pinto a sports car.  I feel that this atrocity was an insult to this IP and I don't even need to play the Game of Thrones nor Borderlands to know it will be the same situation. So overrated that it's hilarious.
2.0	"this game is graphically Excellent and i love scaling along buildings and leaping from various objects...but after about 5 hours, this game gets EXTREMELY repetative...mainly because you cant just locate your target and kill him...you have to do a bunch of pointless things FIRST. youv got to scale about 3 buildings and reach the highest building...then locate an informant who knows who you must kill..but they run you in circles and have you play USELESS Pick Pocket and Interogation side quests...THEN there are street informants who have you kill more people...and a bunch of other run-around, and thats on EVERY mission. half the time, i didn't even kno where to go, it was so unclear...

if they would have just let you know from the JUMP who you had to kill...and let you LOCATE that individual on your own without all the  useless side missions (like everyone thought this game would be), i would have a higher tolerance for this game. but its definately worth the RENTAL..or find it used at Gamestop and return it within 7 days for a full refund. if your into games that take place around this Time frame, i highly suggest Fable for xbox. i picked that game up when i took this back and i love it.

iLL . Rent It.."
2.0	"There's no need to discuss the hype behind this game or its commercial success. We all know it was well received by the public, got great reviews and made Rockstar even richer.

So how does it play? Was it worth the wait? Should it have waited even longer? Maybe and absolutely.

The game does an admirable job of representing what is basically New York and having a sympathetic lead who kills, steals and double-crosses to survive. He doesn't like what he does, wishes he didn't have to do it, but in order to fulfill his objective, he has to do these things. (Note that the vast majority of people he kills, steals from and double-crosses aren't even worthy of being called scum.) The game also forces the player to make some hard choices which have long-lasting consequences. And of course, true to form for a GTA game, there's weapons, explosions, sex, car chases, gun fights and profanities aplenty.

Which leads me to the first of many letdowns for this game. The missions are so repetitive, so tedious, so monotonous, and so boring that it is literally impossible to truly differentiate one mission from the next. A good 50% of the game, probably more involves shooting endless waves of enemies, many of whom pop up in completely illogical places. It is very easy for one enemy to kill you in a matter of seconds after having done so well up to that point.

Which brings me to my next point: Mission failures. The system Rockstar put in place is by far the worst system in any AAA video game, and budget titles would do well to stay far from this as well. If you fail a mission, you must restart the mission entirely. From the beginning. Every single time. It doesn't matter if the mission is a single chase, a single shootout or if there is more than one part to it. (The final mission has five parts to it.) If something goes wrong, you start back at the beginning and you have to redo the entire thing all over again. There are no mid-mission checkpoints. This is completely inexcusable.  Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, so video games have had checkpoints in them for at least seven years now and probably longer than that. Please don't put in a comment about how I forgot about how X game had them in 199X. I am not interested, I am only using that particular game as an example. That's it. End of discussion.

And yet, when you do restart, you still lose EVERYTHING you used in the mission. Why is that? Why should I have to replenish everything I lost on something that didn't actually happen? I can't think of any game that does this, and I probably wouldn't want to play such a game, mainly because I prefer games that are fun. Is having to restock ammo and armor on a mission that didn't actually just happen fun? No. That's downtime, and downtime isn't fun, especially when it's needless downtime. And Rockstar isn't based in someone's garage. This is a very large company with a huge budget, so these amateurish design decisions are even more inexcusable.

Speaking of inexcusable design decisions that were antiquated long, long ago, let's discuss another aspect of gun fights. For some reason, when Niko is being shot at, his default speed, running or walking is the exact same speed as when nothing is going on. SWAT 3 came out almost NINE YEARS AGO, and that game had a dynamic speed change. In other words, if shots were fired, everyone sped up. Not Niko. No, he'll just wander around unless you actually hit the run button. Which also makes him run just as fast as though nothing is going on. Wouldn't someone who is trying to find cover so they don't get shot move faster than if they aren't in danger? If you'd like a more recent example of what Rockstar should have done, take a look at Mass Effect.

The driving mechanics also have a much higher learning curve than what it needs to be, especially with motorcycles and helicopters. Why Rockstar didn't take more time honing the controls and making them easier to pick up is anyone's guess. Same with ladders. I have a friend who will tap the Y button until his thumb is ready to break and even still Niko will not climb the ladder that is right in front of him. This is usually after swimming a ridiculous distance to it since the game doesn't allow the player to just suicide and spawn at the nearest hospital. No instead we have to swim ridiculously long distances. Talk about fun huh?

Which is about the same as can be said for multiplayer. You just walk or drive around the city. There is nothing to do. Nothing. No activities, no places to go, nothing. There are some missions that can be done but if you just want to free roam with a friend in multiplayer, that's ALL you get to do. A drop-in, drop-out co-op in the story mode would've been much, much better.

Oh, yeah, the story. Well what little there is isn't too bad, when the game actually allows you to see it. Most of the time it's too busy bogging you down with those same repetitive missions I talked about earlier where it always goes the exact same way - a deal that shouldn't have any problems where Niko is just there ""as insurance"" turns into a battle ground with lots and lots of enemies, then just they're all dead, more spawn in the area that was just cleared, then the fight leads to a car/motorcycle chase which leads to a police chase, lather, rinse, repeat. Almost all of the missions have this exact same format. The only things that change are the goons' clothing and the SET of lines Niko yells out as he kills them (not the actual lines themselves.) So don't worry kids, if you heard him say something in a mission, he will say it again! And again....and again....and again.

And lastly, for some reason even though games have been doing this for years, GTA IV still allows objects that obstruct your view of the player to remain opaque. Every other high quality title I have ever seen that operates in 3rd person forces such obstructions to go transparent.

The characters Niko takes missions from and/or befriends are your stock cardboard cutouts but let's face it, no one plays a GTA game for the character study. That's why we have those....um....what're those things called, libraries have them....oh well. Anyway, the dialogue is at times rather humorous, especially when Niko is hanging around Brucie. I think we've all known a Brucie at some point in our lives, so to see Niko indirectly poke fun at these guys is a treat. And as usual, GTA IV satirizes many aspects of society and pop-culture that are just begging for it. Celebrities, radio-talk show hosts, gossip magazines, plenty of entertainment venues and the masses that support them all get the healthy shot of parody that has been coming to them for years.

With a whole lot more polish, mid-mission checkpoints and far less repetition, GTA IV would deserve the accolades and commercial success it has enjoyed as of late. As it stands, however, it is yet another proof that hype, a big name label and commercial success do not always mean a great game. It is a good game, but nothing more. Rockstar's Not So Grand Opus"
2.0	Really not a fan of the assassins creed series and should have stayed away from this one. Didn't like it at all didn't like it
2.0	Not gonna write a million things about this but if you have played these games before this collection has no point for you to own, Snake on the go? well maybe for nostalgia but these games show their age the mechanics and gameplay definitely are not up to par with the the games of this generation. Sorry MGS fans this one is best left on the systems of old. Metal Gear Solid, Old is Old
2.0	"This game is full of jank. The main character animations and facial expressions are so awkward that it distracts me and I miss bits of dialog. Its almost like having dead pixels in the center of your screen that constantly draw your attention to them. I want to like this game, I really do, but this is basically game breaking for me. I like dialog as much/more than combat in ME games, and this makes it feel broken and un enjoyable to me.

I guess the combat is more fluid, but thats a result of removing strategy bit by bit with each game. Then you have the removal of good/bad choices, which could be a good thing, but the new system makes choices feel less impactful. I don't like the streamlined classes either, it just makes them kind of pointless like the dialog system. it feels way more simplified than streamlined. Not that I wanted either of those things to begin with.

Very disappointed with this game. 2 stars since it has a lot of content. Do yourself a favor and listen to the reviews"
2.0	"I hate writing negative reviews.  I like writing positive reviews about things that have entertained or educated me, but sometimes something gets me frustrated enough that I feel obligated to inform others.
While I normally start with complaints, I feel it necessary to start with the good things about Arcanum.  Arcanum has the potential to be one of the coolest games ever made.  It has an original story, an immersive world with colorful characters, and a variety of playing styles to suit anyones prefernces.
Unfortunately, all of these positive things are shrouded in one of the buggiest pieces of code that has ever come across my PC.  Characters and Items either fail to appear, or disapppear for no apparent reason making the main plot impossible to further.  It's one thing to get stuck in a little subplot, but it's another thing to get stuck in the middle of the story simply because of technical errors.
I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong at times, only to visit the game forum at the official site and find message after message complaining about ""bug this"" and ""fix that"".  The current patch has done nothing to help me.  I think my bugs maybe a little worse than others, but almost everyone has experienced at least minor bugs and glitches.
If this were some impulse buy I would have just given up and moved on to something else, but Arcanum, when working properly, is a really great game.  That's what makes it SO frustrating, the fact that hidden under all that bad programming a great concept is dying to come out.  I expect more from the guys that created the Fallout series which are some of the most entertaining games ever made.  The guys over at Troika should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this game as a finished product.
Hopefully you won't experience as many showstopping bugs as I did, but be warned, they are out there.  If you don't believe me, just visit the official site boards and look for yourself.  Hopefully, Troika will make this game playable, and if they do I will gladly come back here and edit my review. You make me sad, Troika."
2.0	Limited appeal. I like fighting games but dislike the neutral of this game and the unbalanced characters. Cute for casual play amongst friends, but blows if you want to play it more than once in awhile. Not worth the price. Fun, but not $60 worth of fun.
2.0	I bought this game because I enjoyed the first Twisted Lands game (Shadow Town) and thought the second game (Insomniac) was ok (if not up to par with S.T.). Started playing, but was very disappointed in the storyline and the graphics. The hidden object locations consist of but a handful of locations that you play over and over again, and the graphics within the H.O. portions are muddy. Also, each time you get an item to use (key, puzzle piece), you pretty much have to use it right away at its designated location to proceed -- rarely do you have multiple items in your inventory and have to put thought into where you could use it. The exception to this is when you get an item and have to use it in a way that doesn't make sense (using a pair of handcuffs to lift a manhole cover, for example). I got most of the way to the end before a huge electrical storm hit and blew the circuit in my house, and when I went to start up again, the game said that the file was corrupt and I would have to start over, but ... nah, the game wasn't interesting enough. Forgettable
2.0	When I got it I liked the fan. Now the fan doesn't work. Be aware
2.0	EA what have you done now. Not only do you have to sign up with their steam version but again is not very much like its pre-assessors and expansions and its alternative predecessor Red Alert series even the oddly silly red alert three series. After playing a few missions in such small areas and on complex maps right now all I'm truly interested in is seeing the cut scenes of the actors and how the story ends up playing out the game has very little interest for me EA what have you done now
2.0	"Can you take on the leage and be one of the strongest?
Pros:
Great Gtaphics
Great Music
Finaly got the point of fast break back in the series
Cons:
What the heck, I hate the analog control
Now defensive rebounds are automatic(In 2002 it was offensive, which was better)
3 pointers are almost impossible to make
you pick up way too many fouls(offensivley, defensivley)
Computers(basicly on superstar)just make me wanna punch my T.V.
It's almost impossible to get open
Sometimes, I end up throwing the ball out of bounds
EA just took another big step back
There is hardly any way this game improved on a bad live 2002.  they shoulda sticked with the freaking D-pad, instead of do analog, because now, I just aint good at the game no more.  If you want an EA sports masterpiece, go pick up Madden, NBA Street, or live 2000.
Final Words:After all the much better reviews from sites, I wanted to play this game so badly, only to be dissapointed.  Live just went bad when it came on next gen consoles.  Let's just prey to god that somewhere along the line EA will figure out there mistakes, and bring back the good ol days where live was the top basketball game.
peace In the world of the NBA, only the srong survive..."
2.0	"Listen, I know they're cheap and that's good, but I'd say pass on this one. I got them cause my old headset broke and I just wanted one quick. Bad idea, don't cut across this corner. The mic works as you'd expect, nothing fancy. The headphones are absolute garbage. Sound quality sucks and I could literally only have this thing on my ears for about 30 seconds before they started to ache. I'll definitely return them or you'll find them in a yard sell...maybe goodwill.

Move on people, don't take the cheap route here. They are Cheap...that's about all folks"

2.0	"I bought this game after playing the first stalker game, and I have to say that I am disappointed that my pc will not even read the disk after it is installed. I don't know if it is because of my laptop or the disk being defective.
It did arrive before the estimated date and from what I have read it is a great game. wont work on my pc"
2.0	"The conquest for any big-screen to PS2-screen game is just simply to be good.  The plots always become to developed without you actually doing anything to invoke it, just shooting some people, and sitting through a cut scene.  This game is no exception.  There seems to be no storyline continuing into the actual gameplay, just the cut scenes.  The levels don't allow any exploring.  Further more, even though I enjoy an easy, fairly quick game, AUF takes both of those to extremes.  If you're good, these measly 11 levels can be beaten in 2 hours.
There are two good parts though.  The controls are good, allowing you to scroll through Q's gadgets easily.  The second is the multiplayer mode, with about ten unique environments, and cool weapons.
Overall:  Buy only for the multiplayer mode. Not Very Good At All..."
2.0	Bought this to play with my 6 year old son, result was play control is not the best and as reviewed by a kid = boring.  Single player mode is better but that is not the way we are playing it.  6 & 7 year old playing together also came to the same conclusion and the game is now collecting dust after only a day or two.  Thus a dud from a two player perspective. Not worth it
2.0	"This review is just my opinion of particular aspects of this game, mostly the offline co-op, or lack-there-of. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Please don't get mad at me.

I loved the first Resistance. Great story and solid game-play. The big seller for me was that you could play the full story co-op split screen with a friend, offline. Plus the online was fun as well.

I bought Resistance 2 hoping for basicly the same co-op story mode. Sadly, I was let down. I bought it so my girlfriend and I could play it together; story split screen co-op. Resistance 2 does NOT offer the FULL game in co-op split screen. Only the single player story mode. Everything else is online or a few offline, quite low quality split screen levels.

Dispite the fact that you can't play the full game split screen with a friend, the single player game is amazing. The graphics are a huge step up from the first one and the game-play is perfect and very fun. I was also astounded by the amazing DTS quality sound.

I bought the game for the Co-op split screen story game, and nothing else. So yeah, I'm pretty ticked off. But the single player game is good so far. Between the great graphics and perfect sound, you are in store for quite an intense game. If you liked the first one, this is worth buying without a doubt. No FULL split screen Co-op Story? C'mon."
2.0	"bought the game on steam. i have a 4k gaming pc set up and the graphics are turned down. for a game running cryengine its just sad. moving seems choppy almost lagging. not to mention the gameplay is repetitive and boring. the AI is horrible, a guard forcing 3 ppl to paint a wall, i kill the guard which releases ppl. walk around the block and theres a new guard (standing on top of the dead guard) forcing 3 new ppl to paint that same wall.

in conclusion i got bored with this game far to quick as it was the samething over and over. i wanted this game to be good as it had everything there, just horrible execution. so much potential, horrible game"
2.0	Ok, I allowed myself to buy this game that everybody made a big stink! As soon as I began playing it , it had me on the intro of the story. Then followed by the boaring missions, including side missions you have to do! The control is whacked! The map is terrible! Putting the icons together is frustrating! I regret going on my shopping impulse and spending my money on this game! What was the big hype!
2.0	I just bought this game eariler today.  When I first started playing it I noticed that it kept freezing up all the time when it was loading.  I was plaining to take it back and get a replacement, but after reading the other reviews of the same problem I'll forget it.  This game was a BIG disapointment to me and I'm sure to all the other fans who went out and bought it.  I hope and pray that they don't make ANOTHER wrestling game for the XBox.  It seems everytime they do it SUCKS.  Don't waist your money if you've not bought it yet.  Buy it Used, I'm sure there will be alot of people selling or trading theres. This Game Sucks
2.0	It was just OK. Not a tight fit. Two Stars
2.0	"I decided to purchase this game after reading several reviews here on amazon.  It seems that a good number of people enjoy it, i however did not.  I can appreciate its originality and colorful presentation.  I mean, at first i tried to get into it and just enjoy it as everyone else did.  But after about an hour of listening what sounds like children whacked out on speed say ""Pata Pata Pata Pon"" I thought to myself, why am i subjecting myself to this torture.  In summary, its okay for about the first 10 mins when you stop and say, what a ""cute"" game, maybe it would have been better if David Byrne were singing to the beat, i don't know. Pata what?"
2.0	The game was fun at first servers were full but really it needs a campaign for a new game and now there are only like 400 people that play it and its not the best! The game was fun at first servers were full but really it needs ...
2.0	"Update:
I have been playing this game for a month and this what I think:

1) AWFUL guns selection! it sucks! You will have the option to choose 1 of 6 guns they offer you for each character (mechanic, professional,etc). Weapon accuracy is really bad! There are like 5 good guns in this entire game!
Sniper guns and hand-guns are the worst!

I don't know about you, but I will like to custom my own guns (paint them, attach 2 flash-light, knife, etc)

2) Maps. Some of them are really boring and everyone play as sniper in few of them!
Some map are really hard to enjoy cause they are really small. During night time, there are like 4 maps available to play multiplayer.
And if you want to play more maps, you gotta spend another $40-50 dollars to unlock the super mega ""premium"" edition!

3) Now you can open-close doors, get in building, houses and drive cars, GREAT! I like this! There is one map where you can actually have sandstorm, love it! Battle-field needs to add more weather condition. Zip-lane are cool!

4) Playing multiplayer is not the greatest experience! You may not like to fly helicopter from the outside view cause it lags 1-2 seconds.
No more F-18 planes (GREAT)! Transport helicopter still sucks, the pilot can't shoot or do something!

5) Base rape! You can't do this anymore here (I am 90% sure) which bothers me because now you can have a sniper close to his base and you can't go and kill him (manually). You gotta shoot him somehow from too far away!

What do they need to fix or adjust?
Criminal concept is good but they rushed to much to release this game! They did not add to much gun options and they are not accurate.
Still make me mad that you can't take medic package as a sniper or mechanic! Really hard to kill sniper if he is too close to his base! Hard to see an enemy if he is on the roof. I would like to see a type of drones so you can hit some areas with missiles.

Is it worth?
No! I believe BF 3-4 are better! Nahhhh"
2.0	"I got this game hoping for a great story as all the reviews were raving about it.  But i got bored with the gameplay.  This game is so linear that all your caracter can do is move forward, turn back, and shoot at first person view.

Most of the time you'll find your character walking forward until you see some sort of 'crossroad' which gives you options to manipulate objects, talk to people, or take corners and go into rooms.  You cannot turn left or right in between, just turn back.  When you come across an enemy, you must turn to 1st person view and shoot it (but you can't move while shooting).  This game lacks the freedom of movement of most games.  Even 2D games have more freedom of movement.  This makes the repetitive comment of your assistant quite appropriate... ""We are in a TIGHT spot.""  Gameplay feels old school (when comptuers aren't that powerful).

Anyway, kudos for CAPCOM for coming up with such a creative game.  You don't see games that go away from the mainstream these days. Lacks freedom of movement."
2.0	not well coded for PC...maybe works better for kids with PlayStation or some other console where there are joysticks and other extra buttons. On the PC, AI movement is to complex to allow you to us the keyboard effectively. maybe that is why the PC version is so cheap compared to the console versions... Difficult to play on a PC
2.0	The game simply didn't impress me.  On my previous XBox, I owned PGR1 and PGR2 and when I got my XBox 360, I bought PGR4.  By far PGR2 and PGR4 are the best.  Project Gotham Racing 3 just failed in terms of graphics and concept and if you ask me, the graphics for PGR3 are just as great as the graphics for PGR1 and generally that would be good but considering PGR1 came out in 2001, it is not a compliment.  The game just isn't good! The worst PGR in the line-up!
2.0	Stayed on the controllers for about a month. too loose, making holding the controllers unpleasant. too loose

2.0	"I'm generally a console gamer but since moving to college and having an internet speed that is lightning fast allowing for online gaming, my PC has taken over the role.  (I know, good use of a college education right?)  I really hate playing games on the PC where my hands are spread over the entire keyboard and I have to remember 27 thousand key combinations correlating to buttons that are no where near one another (e.g. press w + spacebar + c + mouse click for ""rolling thrust.""  This was for Jedi Knights:Jedi Academy).  I thought this gamepad would solve my dilemma but Nostromo has not updated any of their game templates since 2003.  From what I understand Logitech provides more up to date donwloads so I recommend checking out their rumblepad along with the Nostromo, see which one better fits your style of gaming.  Cheers. Only for certain game"
2.0	"Super Swing Golf is a weird amalgomation of elements that don't quite all come together.  Based upon a Korean Massively Multiplayer Online golf game, it inherited a really, really long gameplay curve, is ridiculously difficult, and candy coated with a cutsey art style.  And welded onto a Wiimote swing interface.

While the idea of playing golf with a wii controller is sound, by the 50th time you've swung the remote and wondered why your ball hooked sharply left you'll be wishing they spent a little more time on creating some sort of feedback to why your swing keeps failing.  At least in real life you know that it's your fault.  Here, they require you to mimmock the subtlties of a real-world golf swing in order to be successful, but don't actually let you know how to do that or even what that would be.

Despite accessible appearances, this game is actually ridiculously difficult.  The initial learning curve is punishing, especially on your stroke.  In real golf it can take years to get to the point where you're hitting par on every hole.  In Super Swing Golf, you'd better be hitting part on every hole by your third opponent.

Like so many other games in its genre, this one is all about buying clothes.  You need to get money to get clothes, to swing better, to get more money, etc.  It's a viscious cycle that just keeps going.  And with literally hundreds of items, and hundreds of tournaments, there are literall hundreds of hours of gameplay here.  If you can get through the first five without throwing your wiimote out the window, that is.

This game is huge and deep, and I really wanted to like it more than I did.  But with a hugely frustrating learning curve, it's just a glorified exercise in anger management.  If you really want a wii golf game and have a lot of time to invest in one, you could do worse.  However, this game in no way encompases the ""fun and accessible"" mantra that the Wii has made its popularity upon. Deep Korean Online game makes clunky Wii transition"
2.0	Not at all impressed with the graphics.......I played this game for about an hour before shutting it off out of boredom and it took a month to even consider playing it a second time. My advice is go for GTAV instead if you don't own it already...........you won't be sorry! Not at all impressed with the graphics... ...
2.0	"For about the last 4 years I've been using the Nyko play and charge kit with my 360 and I've been very happy with the battery life.  My 360 controllers go for weeks on a single charge and I probably average about 20-25 hours a week on the 360.  That said, I had high expectations for this kit for the Xbox One and these batteries fell very short.  The nicest thing about this kit is the charge indicator on the USB cable.  When I got the kit I plugged in battery 1 until it indicated a full charge then I swapped them out and started charging battery 2.  I put battery 1 in my controller and it lasted all of about 5 hours.  The only reason I gave a 3 star rating is because battery 2 is performing much better and so far has lasted about 20 hours.  Other than that, the batteries fit well and the special battery cover required fits as expected.  It is a little disappointing that the native USB port on the controller can't be used for charging, you have to plug directly into the battery if you want to play while charging, hence the special battery cover...

Update: I don't know if I just got a bad batch or what but these batteries are horrible.  If I'm lucky I might get 10 hours out of them.  I'm going back to AA batteries until I find something better.  These are garbage, revised my review to 2 stars. Not What I expected..."
2.0	"Holy mediocrity... I expected alot more from the steelseries. Its really just a mouse, nothing fancy about it, in fact it feels quite cheap.

Pros: Fancy LED's that you can adjust color and if it blinks or not.
Pros: It does work as a mouse, the pointer doesnt stutter.
Pros: Cord is long, albeit odd... it slips right in and out of my USB ports a bit to easily.

Cons: The thing feels cheap, it feels to light for its size.
Cons: The buttons don't feel good either, the mouse button 1 and 2 are ok, but the side buttons are spaced poorly, I have to reach to press the one of the buttons and its awkward. The side buttons also make an ugly ""clack"" noise.
Cons: The texture, its made out of a smooth plastic, that feels both slippery and sticky at the same time. Im sure Ill get used to it but for now it feels awkward against my palm.
Cons: The DPI settings buttons doesnt make any registry if its in setting 1 or 2, also only 2 DPI settings.
Cons: Software, I cant update the firmware, because it causes the mouse to turn off and never come back on, until I stop the process through CTRL ALT DELETE and unplug, replug the mouse in.

While I don't hate this mouse, I don't like much about it either. If it had more side buttons for MMOs or games that have alot of skills or items, or felt all around sturdier and of higher quality in my hand, Id recommend this mouse... since it has none of this, just the foreword and back keys and feels like smooth slippery plastic with cheap buttons... why not buy a cheap logitech gaming mouse instead? Those at least feel sturdy in your hands. A very meh mouse."
2.0	just not good Two Stars
2.0	Too little instruction on-screen for me to even help her. This DS version was definitely an afterthought in comparison of the full-console versions. Too difficult for my 6 year old.
2.0	"If you enjoy sitting through the same cutscene over and over (which can't be skipped), you'll probably love this one.

Oh - I forgot to mention, you can't save your progress after completing a challenging section. The game decides when you get to save. That means you will do the challenging sections over, and over, and over again, since every time you die, you go back to the last auto-save point.

But my favorite? After you die (and you'll be dying, many times) you go back to a ""loading"" screen that takes about 10 seconds. What's loading? It was already loaded before I died! Save your money"
2.0	"This is a HUGE problem for me.  The only co-op is on the internet with a bunch of snot nosed kids.  Which means you can't just play with a friend at home together on the campaign.  The last game I got was Grid, which ALSO doesn't allow 2P.  What's going on with this STUPID direction.
Otherwise, great game, graphics, yada yada yada.

Get your act together developers--people want to play 2P (or even 4P) on one console in one room! Why no 2P campaign??? WTF?"
2.0	The triggers don't fit quite right.  They clip on at a slight angle.  They still work, just feel a bit off from the other ones I prevoiusly had.  I know this isn't the brand I'd previously bought.  The thumb grips work great. The thumb grips work great.
2.0	Nothing but troubles from this unit.  Initially the microphone wouldn't work.  After I mailed the unit (at whatever cost that was, can't remember), the company replaced the whole headset. Since then syncing between the headset and the sound card is intermittent.  The instructions state the two units are synced out of the box.  Couldn't prove that by me. The manual sync sometimes worked, sometimes didn't.  I really don't need this type of reliability especially at this price.  My Boston speakers as well as the headset are connected to the sound card versus the internal sound element on my ASUS motherboard and I, at least, can't hear much sound improvement.  Lastly the usb port on the headset (for battery recharge) is situated in a place that makes it awkward to insert the cable.  Unit has been such a pain that I generally just don't use it and am saving up some change to purchase something else. All in all I don't recommend this product. Disappointed.
2.0	This is not resident evil, more like resident quick time, resident cut scene. The game is long but the game play is not enjoyable, and the story is all over the place. I picked it up on Amazon for $9.99 and I still payed to much. It only gets 2 stars because its not as bad as Duke Nukem, but it's still time in my life I will never get back. What happened?
2.0	"I bought an S controller at the same time I bought my system A: to have a second controller, and B: to see what type of controller I like better.
As long as your hands are big enough for the original controller (which most of my friends and my hands are), the original controller is actually better than the new S controller.  About the only good thing that thet S controller has is rearranged A, B, X and Y buttons, but the other repositioning is very, very bad.  The Start and Back buttons, and the black and white buttons are right underneath your hands when you are gripping the controller, very awkward to have to bring your thumb back that far when you are trying to play a game. I'd Rather Have Another Original Controller"
2.0	"I love the look and feel of THE POWERPUFF GIRLS on TV, and had high hopes for this game. The 3D CG animated opening, which basically copies that of the cartoon, is really fun and enjoyable. That, with the inclusion of all the major PPG villains, made me think I was in for some fun.
The game aspires to be something more than just your average fighting game, with it's use of all three girls and playpen style fighting arena. There are power-ups and props which are crucial to fighting, along with some special moves and character taunts. But with all that, plus reasonable PS1 graphics, the game is still a bit sluggish on the controls and quickly repetitive.
I wish this game has faster controls, more varied gameplay, and a more involved use of the cartoon's sound fx for both the game and the interface.
It could have been much cuter, I think. the right idea, but mediocre execution"
2.0	I bought this so I can play some retro SNES games...the controller stopped working completely after a month.  Not sure what to make of that...It was a used controller, so I imagine something was wrong with it to begin with so this is really on the seller disappointed
2.0	"But this game sucks.

I'm a diehard transformer fan and a PS3 fan as well, but i would hate to lie and say this game was anywhere close to good because it's so close to being the most awful and annoying game on the PS3-EVER!!

- The missions are boring, simple and not planned very well. (This game was definately rushed, because it had alot of potential.

- I thought i was the only one having sound problems, but after reading other peoples  reviews it seems like i'm not alone.

- The controls suck! especially when you're driving. Talk about understeer and then a sudden oversteer makes the mission absolutely annoying. I don't expect it to be a grand turismo, but the programmers making this game were very confused on wether they wanted the driving to feel simulated or arcade-like...

- Trying to drive, and trying to lock onto the enemy is frustrating as hell.

- Transforming is cool, but it gets old when everything is so damn frustrating.

- A.I is horrible. Talk about dumb enemy robots!

Activision, from my point of view, makes decent games. Not great games but decent. But this one is a total failure in my book.

I'm glad i rented it, and i'm hoping you do too before buying it! it sucks to say this..."
2.0	...I wouldn't pay $.... Yet, that's exactly what I feel like I bought after playing through Squaresoft's first foray into the land of the PS2. Yes, this game has incredible graphics and wonderful sound, as any movie should. What it lacks, however, is any sort of creativity. I mean, I felt like I was playing Final Fight or Double Dragon again. Square has raised the bar so much with their sparkling RPG's, and it is a shame that this product managed to creep out of the warehouse. Let's hope that Square does better the next time (as I know they will)... If I wanted to watch a movie...
2.0	"Anyone who has been on their forums will already know it's buggy. What you might not expect, is that it's still almost unplayably buggy even after the patch (and yes I installed the right one). For instance, in part 5 of the tutorial you are supposed to talk to 2 guys, now for the first guy, this is no problem. However for the 2nd guy, you can't talk to him. The game simply won't let you. I've done everything I could to get my guy to talk to him, and it simply wouldn't. And since I can't advance in the tutorial without talking to him, I can't learn any of the other parts of the game.

Ignoring that problem, the game is extreemally chuggy. My PC well exceeds the reccomended requirements, and I have chuginess about as much as possible (without it becoming considered lagg). Now this doesn't effect game play too much (unlike if it had been in an action game) but it's still extreemally annoying.

If any of you have a decent DVD Drive or x64, be sure to set aside about 2 hours to get the game up and running. There is copy protection, which does a very bad job (not Starforce though), and will constantly think you have a copy of the game instead of the original CD, regardless if you have the original or not. I personally had to un and re install several times, try different directories, different ways to get around the protection, and a few other things before I was finally able to simply RUN the game.

And besides all of this, the controlls are something you'll never get used to. The camera is controlled by the right button, the person moves on a ""click here"" method, loading and unloading requires you click, drag, click, drag, click, click, click, click, wait, and then repeat to finish the process. Really they're just very poorly done. I've never played an RPG with these controlls.

Now, beyond this, the game might be very good, I don't really know, because of the bugs I never got to learn. Now, if they decide to relese another patch that actually FIXES the game (which I can't imagine they wouldn't do considering how buggy this game is) I will re-review the game. But as for now, I'm leaving the rating at 2 stars. Buggy, Chuggy, and a pain to install"
2.0	After playing with this thing for 20 minutes or longer expect to start feeling uncomfortable. They should make one that lets you bring the nunchuk further back so it's not so close in that awkward position. The Zelda game that comes with it though is fun, short, but fun. Not very comfortable
2.0	Hooked it up through my 4k Vizio TV via optical and while the sound it could produce was impressive, at low volumes, you couldn't hear any dialogue. Living in an apartment, the last thing I wanted was to get the cops called trying to watch The Walking Dead going from having to turn it up for whispers, to having ultra loud gun shots. TV speakers normalized the audio just fine, but the N1 soundbar failed in this dept. Can't hear dialogue at lower volumes, does not normalize the audio.
2.0	I'm saddened to say that this game that I looked forward to playing for so long is one of the most disappointing gaming experiences of my life.  First of all, I must say that it felt like it was so close to being a great game.  The graphics, story, and setting are all mostly great.  The controls are passable though not perfect.  Now, I'm not the type of person who wants a game to hold my hand the whole way through, but that doesn't mean I want to constantly be scratching my head on where to go or what to do.  Also, the difficulty playing on normal seemed to vary wildly.  I usually make it a point to finish every game I buy, even if they cause some frustration, but this game...I will not.  One of the boss battles in particular was really unevenly balanced.  Too bad, I wanted to enjoy this game. Could have been a great game.
2.0	"The game was good. There's nothing more I can say because like all FPSs it's the same thing all over again just in a different time and different place. However, it was a fun FPS game that I enjoyed; but then again who wouldn't love going around shooting people in a game? It really gets your frustrations out. So all in all the game was good. The problem I have with it (which therefore is causing me to sit on the fence) is that it was SO short. Honestly, I'm not the kind of gamer that likes to beat games quickly (I like to play a little of one game, and a little of another and so on and so forth simply because I like making my games last) but yet somehow I finished it in one day. The amount of time I spent on it was the exact same as any other game I have played (Bioshock, Call of Duty, Borderlands) but instead of doing around 25% of the game- it was finished. I was so disappointed when I realized I had finished it, because honestly I really liked the game. Another example of a game that was also sadly too short was Halo 3. I'm sure many of you have played Halo 3 and I'm also pretty sure that you also thought the game was too short. If that is true then I don't suggest buying this game. If you want a game that you can explore, do things how you want to and get hours of game play out of it, I suggest something like: Skyrim, Fallout 3/New Vegas, Dishonored.. those are all amazing games that are far from short and have endless things to do. With that said, another great game like this is Red Dead Redemption.
So basically what I'm saying is that if you REALLY like FPSs and don't care how long it is as long as you can shoot people then sure get the game it was fun. If you don't mind getting a game that has some shooting but is longer and has more map space then get one of the games I suggested. If you like long, open world games then you should really look into Bethesda's game collection.
So yeah, as you can see I really don't know whether to hate it or love it. I'm on the fence about this game."
2.0	"Okay, to be blunt, everything about this game makes me sick. Let me start at the game description. It promises 24 players, including Mr. Fantastic and the Human Torch. However, the DS game offers only 15 heroes, and the Human Torch and Mr. Fantastic are not playable.

Also, unlike the original Ultimate Alliance, this version only offers four super powers for each character. In the original, you had a whole arsenal of super powers that were actually pretty cool. In this game: you stick with what you got. The ability to change your uniform at will is excluded, too.

Another problem, the biggy, the main reason I bought the game: fusions. The description made it sound so glorious: fantastic combinations; a fiery tornado; over 250 unique combos! In fact, the ""fusions"" are just each character performing their regular special moves with no hint of combination. Yes: Wolverine will still run around in a circle waving his claws no matter who he is teamed up with. And yes: Thor does the exact same special move when teamed with Storm as he does with Hulk.

So, pretty much the only positive thing out of that mess of a game was that there wasn't any annoying loading screen every time you enter a new room. Still, I would take the loading screen if they actually put some effort into making this game likable. Yuck..."
2.0	Small, and cannot accommodate many games which you will surely need. Two Stars
2.0	If your looking for a traditional sneak and subdue this is for you, but if you want some action to spice it up this isn't for you. nothing like splinter cell yet nothing like metal gear series either (supposed to be an RPG......). All the stealth you want and none of the action
2.0	"First, let me say that I wasn't one of the ""first responders"" to the Wii U. I literally found out about it two days before it came out last Fall. I've been out of the video gaming world for about a year because it was consuming me (I'll spare you the gory details). I've been easing myself back into it, and once I heard that a new hardware platform was coming out from dear old Nintendo - ahead of the Xbox 720 and PS4 - my curiosity piqued.

So for Christmas 2012, my lovely fiance - unbeknownst to me - purchased the Wii U Deluxe edition for me. At my age, even though I was interested in the console and kind of wanted to check it out, I didn't think I'd get it so soon. After all, there were so many shortages at launch that I figured I'd be fine waiting until later 2013 to get it. Add to that my incredible skepticism that Nintendo would put out an HD console that had third-party support ahead of the competition, and needless to say, I was scratching my head.

The launch seemed to be a mixture of good and bad reports. Shorter than expected battery life of the GamePad's battery (true); no real performance numbers known for the new Wii (true; no one still seems to know just how powerful it is); strong initial third-party support, even though most of the offerings were ports of existing games on the other two consoles (true); reports that the Wii U isn't as powerful as the 360 or PS3 (false); and it goes on and on. None of that matters now because I own it. And I love it. The apps, the accessibility, the lack of those stress-inducing achievements/trophies, a solid interface, solid hardware, HDMI cable in the box (come on Microsoft, really? You can't offer a cable with your 360?), USB hard drive support up to 2 TB, full Wii backward compatibility support, and the list goes on. Sure, Nintendo Land is completely lame (sorry, just not my bag whatsoever at age 35), but at least the console came with EVERYTHING you need to play your old Wii games, and NO new accessories are needed whatsoever. The sensor bar comes with it, and all the Wii controllers work with it.

I like how I can play games on my Wii U remotely on the GamePad's 6.2"" LCD screen. Just find a wall outlet to keep it juiced and you're good to go (or the battery extender from Nyko, forthcoming). The Wii U will allow you to run games wirelessly up to about 20-25 feet from the console base. Someone else can be watching TV, but you can be playing your game on a beautiful tablet-like interface. The GamePad's screen isn't going to rock your socks like the iPad retina display, but it's very nice and definitely high quality. And you can use your fingers or a stylus on it, whereas the iPad you need to use your body signals (fingers only, let's hope).

I bought Batman Arkham City: Armored Edition, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, and Mass Effect 3 Special Edition. I have only played Batman thus far because, again, I'm pacing myself, but it's just amazing in the detail. Every bit as good as the other editions (I have it for PS3, as well). There's NO difference, and honestly the GamePad integration is so cool that that feature alone makes this edition the best one. Plus, it has all the DLC included. I also have some experience with purchasing a game from the eShop, Nintendo's online store. I purchased Trine 2: Director's Cut, and the experience buying the game right on the GamePad was positive. The download, at around 2GB, took about 15-20 minutes...kind of lengthy with my broadband connection...but it installed quickly and ran smoothly (and is one of the most graphically stunning games I've ever seen).

Then it was on to the Miiverse, Nintendo's online community. Each game has its own discussion board, which you can add to your favorites under your profile for easier management. You can add comments and generally participate in threads like you can on your PC. The typing is slower with a stylus or your finger, but it works and with 100 character limitations on comments, you're not typing novels anyway. But it's nice because you can connect with people who are playing the games you are, and vice versa. The chat function works independently from the Miiverse. The GamePad's integrated camera is used for video chatting; again, like the 6.2"" screen, it won't win awards, but it's clear and it works.

Right now it's way too soon for me to make any kind of prediction on how Nintendo will do in 2013 and beyond, but it's clear they need to get moving with the advanced hardware and GamePad interface if they are to get a grip on a market that has all but slipped from their fingers. Call of Duty, Black Ops 2 has only about 3,000 players worldwide on their multiplayer servers, which is abysmal to say the least. But I'm not discouraged. Most hardcore gamers like me have more than one console since EACH of them offers something unique and cool, mostly in their games. Talk about apps and services all you want, ultimately it comes down to the games. Will the next Zelda really shine? I think so, and I hope it transports me back to the days of my youth when I discovered my favorite elf in green.

UPDATED 3/5/14: Well, it's been over a year and there's barely 50 games available for the WiiU. I'm having a rough time considering I gave the WiiU such a rave at first during the first month of launch. I'm highly disappointed with the console, the lack of games, the waning third-party support, and exclusives that ended not being exclusives. Still no new, more mature Zelda game, just an HD remake of a 10-year-old WindWaker (great game regardless, but reboots of old games are getting stale as all three of the ""next gen"" consoles are cashing in on old game remakes). More of the same gimmicky stuff that developers are abandoning for easier-to-develop-for PS4/XBone (though I can argue that the XBone is not nearly as easy to develop for as the PS4). I'm sad to report that I've dropped the WiiU down to two stars. I look like an idiot for constantly believing in Nintendo when they constantly let me down. The WiiU has been nothing but a dust collector for almost a year. Nothing good came out for it except for the BARELY decent Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, which is another rehash of the same tired 2D mechanics...and it has more complicated controls than previous DKC games.

Of course, to back up my changed review, Nintendo recently (end of 2013) announced abysmal sales projections for the WiiU and changed the projection while their CEO took a six-month slashed salary. Not a good sign, Nintendo. I have faith, but it's waning now for sure in light of yet another failed piece of gimmicky hardware with a major gap in the game library. A solid next-gen effort turned sour in a year..."
2.0	I really wanted to like this but couldn't. I'm a huge survival horror fan so was really looking forward to playing this back in the day.  I thought it was a slam dunk when I started.  Beautiful graphics, good control, great story but one thing completely killed the experience and that was spawning enemies.  When you have a game that gives you limited health and ammo you can't afford to waste it and unfortunately each time I cleared the house of enemies, saved and turned off the console the next time I played all the enemies had respawned and I had fewer resources now.  It just got so frustrating I quit.  It had to be one of the most frustrating games I ever played. Frustrating
2.0	"Well, I just had to find out for myself... BestBuy had the special edition on sale for $49.99 so I took the chance, ""how bad can it be?"" well I'm early in the game, offline made it to the lickers... died 3 times and quit playing. I might give it another go, then try online which might make it more fun, but i hate online. If this was Move control compatible like I wanted it would at least be a cool light gun type/Move game, but no matter how I adjust the aiming it sucks... I might put back on the default auto aim and lock on, but don't know if that will improve the flailing controls. The graphics aren't bad, there's pop-in with minor details but it all feels buttery, when you kill things it just feels like mush... there's no feeling of physical illusion, it's all kind of shiny, buttery, goo. I haven't tried yet, but If I can still unlock the special weapons I might play it some more... if you can level up offline buying more powerful weapons might make it easier and hence more fun.

I'd rather Crapcom had made a newer Outbreak game wish characters you can give a F' about over these faceless goons. Operation Flailing Controls"
2.0	These sounded really hollow, and a big downside to these was the unconvincing surround sound. Definitely not my cup of tea. These sounded really hollow, and a big downside to ...
2.0	"I really want to love this mouse.  Here's why:

1. Even for my small hands, its profile follows the curvature of my hands quite readily.
2. Lots of genuinely usable buttons.  Too many gaming mice have buttons just for the sake of having buttons however I find they are poorly laid out. The button layout on this mouse was well thought out.  Even with my small hands I had no issues accessing them.
3. Design. It looks spectacular.  One of the better looking gaming mice, IMO, with the ultra cool matte black, vibrant red accents, and RBG lighting.
4. DPI indicator lets you quickly know exactly which setting you're on so when you're selecting it there's no guessing like on many other mice, where it's a trial and error just to find out if you're at the lowest or highest setting.  Here you have explicit LEDs for each level of DPI.
5. VERY fast mouse.  The polling rate is great and immediately noticeable as soon as I watched the cursor move across my screen.  It's so smooth, like it's rendering at 120hz
6. Very cool looking, high quality braided cord.  And even better red/black color combo coincidently matched my favorite pair of Vans sneakers.
7.  Instead of soft touch coating, they use a grippy texture coating for the matte black paint.

So, why the low score?  What gives?!!

The two issues I have with it are entirely tactile issues.

First of all it feels REALLLLY cheap.  I know it's only a $45 mouse but that doesn't change this fact or how I feels in my hand, or how I feel about it. There is a hollowness about it that can only be experienced. I will try my best to explain it. It feels like cheap plastic and just looking at the red plastic you can tell it's cheap.  And every time you pick it up and set it down, there's a vibration it produces as if the internals weren't secured very well to the casing. In fact every time I pick it up and I set it down I feel the vibration of the internals reverberate through every fingertip.  Tactile sensation is extremely important with an input device, and any really good gaming mouse *just has to* feel solid.  This one doesn't, not by a long shot.  It's true what they say, you get what you pay for.

But even worse, was that despite the grippy texture, the shape of the mouse makes it rather difficult to pick up without really having to squeeze the sides.  A good gaming mouse needs to be sculpted in a manner that not only feels natural, but can be gently lifted with little effort.  If you look at the front or rear profile straight-on, you will see that it see that all of the slopes with exception to the button yoke around the thumb, are sloped outward towards the table, so lifting the mouse requires some effort.  Picking any object up without some form of an under-curve means it requires you to lift up entirely with your grip rather than some of the weight resting on your hand. mice have an inward curve for this reason.  Having to actually grip the mouse to lift it is probably something I might get used to over time, but right now I feel my ring and pinky fingers sliding up on the mouse as I lift it. This has greatly impacted my performance in nearly every single game that requires rapid mouse movements which defeats the purpose of buying a gaming mouse by making me a worse player than I was.  My plan to correct this is to use Sugru to create a small ridge or overhang, if you will, along the the outermost finger contour so it 'hooks' onto my fingers, so I can lift it effortlessly.

While I don't want to pay $90 for gaming mouse, the reality is you get what you pay for.  I own an Roccat Tyon gaming mouse and is as solid as ti gets, in quality (hardware AND software), features, and performance. A truly astounding piece of tech.  I cheaped out and bought this one to use for work, not really wanting to spend another $90 for the Tyon for just occasional gaming, but I realize there's really no other way around it. If you want good quality you gotta pay for it.  It is heads and shoulders above any mouse I've used, including the legendary Razer Death Adder which itself is a truly spectacular mouse, in terms of ergonomics and performance. It's the mouse I would definitely get if I wanted just a basic gaming mouse. Why don't I love this mouse?  You get what you pay for..."
2.0	I bought these thinking they would be compatible with gamecube controllers, but they are too big Two Stars
2.0	"I really tried to like this game. I put a lot of hours into trying to like it, but its not fun ! This game involves too much reading for me, just get me to the quick action, give me my fix, I don't care about in-depth plots or long lengthy dialogs anymore, thats old style RPG games. I prefer the Diablo, Everquest, and World of Warcraft quick fix style of play; all action, many players to interact with, a social status element to the game, loose story line, free to go and roam wherever and whenever I feel like it. Everquest has hundreds of players to interact with. I can choose not to fight and hang out in a pub and chit chat with other players in Everquest. In Neverwinter I get to hang out and chat with a bunch of NPC's , boring! The multiplayer element is poor in neverwinter. It might have been really good when it was released, but these days its an abandoned ship; all the players have jumped off of Biowares ship and stole away to either Sony or Blizzard. So trying to play a multiplayer Neverwinter Nights game these days is hopless. The items in this game can't match the item selection in those other games, treasure is banal and ""+1 or +2 to this and that"". I like big numbers even though +1 or +2 means a lot in old school D&D and is equivalent to +50 something in Diablo. The +50 to all atributes in Diablo just has a much more mouth watering effect, it makes me want to leap for joy. Bigger numbers look better. Bioware change the number system. A barbarian in Diablo that has 500 strength is a lot more interesting than a warrior that has 18 strength in old school D&D. A bigger number system just looks better. too old fashion RPG style"
2.0	"I love the Deus ex series. The first game was ground breaking and I enjoyed human revolution. However, mankind divided feels like it was developed on a deadline and delivered nothing new. It is what you expect most of the way through but there is never any real payoff at the end. The campaign feels like it was cut short to save money. The hacking sidegame is gimicky and did not add anything for me. Yeah, let's reuse these models but change the skinning so they look like the TV version of ""computer programs"" and call it ""hacking"". Overall, it felt short and unpolished. That's not to say it is a terrible game but it definitely fell far short of the high bar of the better Deus ex games. Feels rushed. Playable, but not amazing."
2.0	"The seller was ExpressMedia. I paid 6 bucks. It worked fine on my PC running Windows XP Home SP3.

The graphics and sound effects are okay.

The voice acting is poor and annoying.  ""Talk to me, Sir""...you'll hear that a lot from your squad; they should talk less and fire more.  And then there is the sexually-seductive sounding way that your teammate tells you: ""Way to go, Captain""...after you make a good shot.  Yuck.  It made me feel creepy.  And there is similar weird sounding dialogue coming from your team.

The AI (your team) is poor; interacting with your squad is cumbersome.  I found it easiest to tell my entire team to just follow me, but they routinely get stuck somewhere.  The enemy AI is okay.

The middle mouse button is reserved for squad commands, so don't reassign that mouse button to another key.  The middle mouse button is not listed in the on-screen controls/key mapping; I found it in the game manual. Who reads the manual anymore?  It should all be in the options menu...configurable or not.

Want to crouch?  Hit C.  Hit C again to go prone.  Want to stand up?  Hit V to go from prone to crouch.  Hit V again to stand all the way up.  And there is a THIRD key to go from stand to prone and back. Really?  Just give me ONE key to stand/crouch/prone.

I didn't find a way to take cover...just need to crouch behind something, but crouch is not much different than standing.

I felt like it was a run-and-gun game...not much strategy needed.  Just head toward the goal and kill targets along the way.

I played the first and second ""Acts"" in GRAW2, but I got bored with the game...it just wasn't fun.  I figured I would try to finish the game using god mode, but that's not easily available.  So, I stopped playing (and I'm glad I did, since Chaos Theory is much better, and I'd rather play it instead).  I'll sell GRAW2.

2.0	I really don't know how this game won graphics of the year cause they suck. The camera angle is like 20ft above your guy so its stupid. Also the bosses are so hard and take for ever to beat. I played this game 1time and i regret buying it. Bad
2.0	"What is the point of playing a game if it doesn't have an ending???  I don't know...

Either way, this is more of an interactive movie than a game.  All you do is play audio clips that trigger memory flashbacks.  There really aren't any puzzles, just a few movements to make when you play someone during a flashback.  If you don't want much to do then this game is an enjoyable one, because it has a great feel to it.  The environment is really interesting.

But then again, It didn't explain really anything in the end.  Maybe they are making a sequel??? Point???"
2.0	This game isn't very good. Trying to adjust the camera angle to you're liking,can be very annoying. It's tough to pick which one is JUST right,because sometimes it will be too close or sometimes it will be too far up,as you control it with the right along stick. The gameplay is fair,but it can get pretty damn hard when you got a whole gang of enemies trying to kill you. It's tough to kill them all. Especially when your health is low,and it can get very low really fast,from the attacks. I found the graphics to be pretty bad. I know this game was made in 2005,but I can think of games that were made before then,that had better graphics than this. The music is okay,as it fits the whole theme of the game. If you plan to buy this game,don't pay too much for it. Anything over five bucks is too much for this game. I picked it up at my local video store for only two dollars,so for me it really wasn't much of a loss. Pretty Lame
2.0	Don't be fooled by the title, just because you can keep yourself from wrecking by moving the stick certain ways, doesnt make it any more of a challenge. Actually in all the games, Pure, Motorstorms(the best), and older MX vs ATV, you could always steer or move to avoid accidents. Graphically the game looks no different than MX vs ATV untamed which i prefer over this, and much worse than Pure, or Fuel(one of the worst off road games to date). So all that being said i'm a huge off road fan, and enjoyed many games in the past, this one is just a rehash of, well the same ole same ole, with added movement (they claim), to steer better and more accurate through ruff terrain(whoopi, lets through in some pyshics and weather here!!). Sorry i rented it and i would not pay ten dollars for that, along with bad graphics, let alone [...] bucks. Btw i played it for 15 minutes, got the hang of things, became bored, then shut it off and played Trials ha:).....Move on. Nothing new here
2.0	"I am a huge Alien(s) and Predator fan, I loved the original films, and could say that Aliens vs. Predator 2 on PC is the end of FPS games for me.  I felt the game mechanics of that PC game were top notch, graphics great for their day, and the multiplayer lobby server as well at online matches were out standing.

When I heard this game was being made on the Next Gen workhorse consoles I was very excited but skeptical due to my fondness of the original, baring that Jaguar and Arcade games,  AvP games on PC. Sadly my skepticism was correct for me.  I find the game mechanics of this new AvP to be choppy, sluggish, and unpolished.  The graphics are lacking. The sound is spot on tough. The online gaming is frustrating due to the fact that the lobby server is not an active search that lists multiple matches and allow you to pick one as the PC games did.  Instead this one picks a game, and does not give you much control there after.

This being said my biggest problem with this game is that fact that I did not find it to be fun at all.  Alien melee is a bit random compared to the previous games as is the melee of the Predator.  Predators also start out with only wrist blades in multiplayer.  The Aliens wall crawling ability is somewhat disorienting and frustrating with the ""transitioning"".  Marines kick @$$, in terms of their weapons, exactly what you'd want in a Colonial Marine.  However, some of the odd camera movements when climbing on or over things can be frustrating at first as well.

Either way, I was disappointed and really hope they release a patch to fix some of the issues.  But I won't know since I traded it back in already. lol I loved the 2 PC AvPs, but this one left me wanting..."
2.0	"After a while they developed a deep bass heart beat thumping in the left speaker that does not go away unless unplugged.
Turning off the extra bass does not fix it either.
They were nice when they worked properly. They were nice when they worked properly"
2.0	"I enjoyed the action packed character classes and gorgeous graphics. There's a lot to explore and  fun events. Even though the game has been out a while there are still lots of bugs or things they need to balance out.  Surprisingly if you report someone exploiting the game, being racist or spot a game bug, the developers don't really want to hear it.  You get a generic cut and paste reply from support, or see dozens of people being silenced and get trouble on the public forums reporting the similar problems. It is happening on both EU and NA servers and it's absurd to harm those helping to trying to improve the game.

The wallet power is pretty strong in Tera, don't be fooled by free2pay label.  It's pay2win. The flip side is if you have little time to play. You can purchase the best gear in the game, instantly level to 58 without actually playing, and easily beat down skilled players with your credit card. Obviously this kills the spirit of fair sportsmanship or those who legitimately want to play the game. Also if you don't log in every day, your character becomes crippled and it can take up to a week to get back full strength.  These kind of desperate gimmicks are what made facebook game unpopular and manipulative. They have no place in MMOs and tera feels past it's prime.

Overall tera can be fun, unfortunately it's diminished by over zealous corporate greed and neglect at times.  Don't just take my word for it. Look at the empty EU servers, gameforge reviews since 2013 or racist comments on NA eme public forums.

2.0	"I really wanted to like this game, owning as I do Battlefront I and II, however... (see cons)

Pros:
Looks amazing. Ok, if limited, gameplay.

Cons:
VERY restrictive. No custom multiplayer, no ""get together with JUST your mates and AI."" EA, we don't all want to play with the entire internet. Limited map selection. Slow (pay as you go) content rollout. Expensive for the amount of content.

Typical EA control--we'll tell you what you like, and how to use it. I guess it was easier to roll out a Battlefield clone than make a real successor to Battlefront II. I don't care if you make 9000 little badges, it doesn't make up for your lack of content and customer control. No custom multiplayer; no real LAN party appeal, very limited (two player only) multiplayer vs. AI."
2.0	"I was really looking forward to this game but it has turned out to be a game that I really really hate. Everyone keeps saying give it time, just wait, they will fix the issue. BAH! Here is my beef...
I am a PVE person, I don't really enjoy RVR or PVP. PVE content is shallow at best. The Public Quests (PQ) are fun IF you can find enough people to play. Most of the time, only the first PQ has anyone and the rest are empty. So much for one of the best ideas of the game. There really isn't enough PVE action to justify spending [...] bucks a month trying to grind out a level. Want to play solo, not this game. You HAVE to RVR which means you are thrown into a group of strangers who couldn't play their class to save their sorry little lives.
RVR.. What a joke. Lv 1 characters are thrown in with lv 10s. Can you say not a chance. The same issues as you level up, characters 10 levels higher than you will beat the snot out of you. The healers will only stay alive is they have a wall of tanks to protect them but wait... No wall of tanks. Most people in this game care little about team work and couldn't work together to make toast. Healers try to DPS, another joke. Casters drop very very quickly. Not to mention, your own spells hurt you. What a horrible stupid idea. As if you weren't easy enough to kill, now you can do your enimies a favor and blow yourself up while trying to DPS. Did I mention what a STUPID idea?
I tried (I really really tried) this game for 2 months but I just have to walk away. It had great potential but only people who want to beat on other people will find any enjoyment in this game. Anyone else who wants depth, look elsewhere. (I know there isn't much out there at this time)
This is the only game where I had to log out after 30 minutes of RVR because of frustration and anger. I am a long time MMORPG gamer (EQ, EQ2, WOW, Vanguard, etc) and have enjoyed many years of fun games but this one truely will give me an ulcer if I continue to force myself to play it. You will find rabid fans of warhammer who will die trying to protect its honor, but when 5 of my friends who started the same day I did all left the game with the same issues, there is something seriously wrong. This is one of the few games and only MMORPG that I truly hate. Sorry warhammer, I will spend my money elsewhere.
On a side note, you would think mythic would know something is wrong when their paying customers are fleeing the game. The population levels are so low on the servers that they are offering free transfers to get people on the same servers. I honestly hate this game"
2.0	"Looking back, I've got to to say that I have yet to find any game developed or published under the 'Codemasters' logo that I've truly enjoyed.  I've come across quite a few and I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, picking up and playing through most of them.  The end result for pretty much all of them left me with the feeling I get when I take a bite of one of those fluffy French pastries with the powdered sugar on top; sort of sweet but filled with nothing but air and really messy at the end.  They try, but just don't seem to have the revenue or the skill to match their convictions.  It's too bad, because I'd be more than happy to give them an 'A' for effort.

GAMEPLAY-1 Star
For this type of story, I'd almost think they shot themselves in the foot by turning it into a basic first-person shooter, and the way Codemasters seems to do shooters is to have you wander down corridor-like areas and literally SWAMP you with wave upon wave of enemies at periodic intervals.  Kill all of them, travel a little bit further and repeat.  For this type of concept, a Resident Evil style of play would be better in my opinion.  Make it a little slower paced but more suspenseful.  After all, it's supposed to be horror, not straight bang-'em up action.  And the action is mind-numbingly dull, meaning walk forward, pull a trigger, walk forward, push a button, open a door, walk forward, kill everything that's not a team member while avoiding exploding demons and barrels.  Yawn.  That style of play tends to lose its impact for me very quickly.

STORY-4 Stars
According to the story, before God created Adam, He created a prior, sexless entity named the Firstborn.  Indescribably powerful but apparently viewed as a flawed creation by its maker, the Firstborn was left abandoned, banished from its Father's sight, to wander alone in a barren nether realm.

Jealous of the attention that it sees God lavishing on humanity, it resolves to destroy man and recapture God's love for itself.  It breaks through to our world at the site of Al-Khali (roughly translated from Arabic as 'The Empty Quarter'), an ancient abandoned city of the Middle East.

Strange sightings are reported from that area along with unusual weather patterns, prompting the deployment of a special team of soldiers to investigate, each gifted with their own unique supernatural ability.

It quickly goes south from there.

GRAPHICS-5 Stars
The visuals of Jericho are incredibly detailed.  This is the most immersive aspect of the game that I've found.  The creatures are grotesque, the zone in the desert you find yourself in is convincingly remote and forlorn and I LOVE the effect when, after one of the demons is killed, a swarm of flies flows over the body to devour it.  I find myself playing the game just to see that at times.  Your team members and the demons are also very intricate in their design.

SOUND-3 Stars
The ambience is wonderfully rendered through the sound effects, music and dialogue... at first.  It quickly becomes repetitive after the first few levels.  There are only a few points where the dialogue wanders off the beaten path.  That kind of thing only serves to remind me that this is, in fact, a game.

REPLAY-1 Star
I have found no way to get anything different from going through this game more than once.  It's the same areas, the same enemies and the same non-witty sarcastic remarks from your team members each time you pop it into your console.  I DO try to get something different out of each game or movie that I watch, but this one just didn't manage to draw me in enough.

OVERALL-2 Stars
Again, sadly, the idea behind Clive Barker's Jericho showed promise, but poor execution marred it beyond any hope of true quality.  Unless you're the type of person that enjoys simplistic gameplay, this game will probably leave a void where satisfaction is supposed to be.

And I have a feeling that that's EXACTLY what the Firstborn wants. It May Look Good on Paper, But..."
2.0	"What a massive dissappointment! Extremely linear gameplay that amounts to you shooting dumb bullet sponge enemies over and over again to get lackluster ""loot"". Three planets and one moon to explore but guess what? It's linear to the extreme with zero to explore or do in. Sure the graphics are nice to look at and the gunplay feels good as it should be from the creators of Halo....btw Call Of Duty campaigns are longer than this! Hell the they have a better plot too.

Don't believe me? Watch the AngryJoe Review of Destiny on YouTube right now. He sums it up perfectly. Waste of hard earned money"
2.0	"Whew, what can I say? This is the first Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG),  to be on any home console and I have to say it is one of the worst out there. As with any other MMORPG you create an account and pay your monthly fee. Next you create a character and log into the huge massive world. Perhaps the massive world is the only thing I liked about this game, as it was always a pure joy to just walk around and seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldy go where no other Everquest nerd has gone before! Honestly though I did find it fun and enjoyable to walk around the world. Anway, once you make your character you do missions or ""quests"" in which you complete tasks and are awarded Experience Points (XP). XP points get your character levles. Once each new level is obtained, it takes more XP to get to the next one. The advantage of getting to a higher level is that you can: 1. Wear new armor, get new weapons, kill bigger animals, and do new and repetitive quests. The max level you can obtain is 50, and to give you an idea of how long this will take to obtain Sony says the following: 500-600 hours! WOW! I can tell you for a fact that it will take around 1,000 hours for most people. In order to get that valuable XP you have to kill animals and fantasy monsters. You do so by endlessly typing into your USB Keyboard (NEEDED ITEM!) asking for a group. Once in your group, you walk to an area to kill go kill these monsters. You kill monsters by pressing the X button. Each monster takes about 20 button presses. It takes about 500 kills to level up. To most sane people this is just too much. To top it off, if you cannot find a group, you cannot kill these animals and so the game becomes usless if there isn't anyone else playing. This game becomes very, very, very, stressful in the later levels, which is why I canceled my account just days ago. As icing on the cake, the game graphics are very poor. I do not recomend this game at all.
Graphics: 1/10
Sound: 1/10 (Hardly any sound at all)
Replayibility: 10/10

Multiplayer: No Stay Away, Far Away!"
2.0	"This game is so weird that the weirdness really takes away from the game play. And I don't like how you play as the bad witch killing angles I like to play as the good person and be the hero of the day not play some weird sorta evil character.

On the other hand the frame rates and graphics are good. Very Strange Game"
2.0	This game has a great concept, but so much lamer than the second one. Kind of boring in all honesty. The graphics are really bad and cartoony as well. Not a great purchase. Eh.
2.0	Unpleasant coarse feel (think ping-pong paddle or racquetball). The red trigger is painted and the edges aren't sharp and crisp. Though it shares the same innards as the UtechSmart Venus mouse, that mouse has a thumb rest and a better texture than this one. It was unclear from the photos, but the entire bottom of the mouse is red, and I don't like red. Pass on this--I recommend the UtechSmart Venus instead
2.0	"These headphones not only drain your batteries like a mofo, they don't even work 75% of the time!! I have to keep unplugging them and plugging them back in, then messing with the 1/8"" cable connection. It comes with an adapter so you can use it with the new controllers. I honestly regret purchasing this and wish I would've waited until I found a better deal. The dude at GameStop said he'd heard no complaints and his co worker had one and loved it. I will probably end up selling it and getting a better one.

As far as sound goes: it sounds great! But I already have 2 or 3 good pair of headphones laying around I could use for that. I bought this so I could chat with friends and others while I play Xbox. When it does work, it works ok.

The picture is a bit decieving, the mic doesn't flip up like other headsets I've had, it bends up. Let me explain: when you open up the box the mix arm is a seperate piece that you plug to the right side headset via headphone jack (1/8"") so when you want to get it out of your face the whole thing just bends as opposed to sliding up and out of the way. A plus though is that it can be muted on the adapter, so when you don't want other players to hear your noise you can just mute the mic.

There is also a ""turtle beach bass booster"" button. It makes it sound somewhat better but I'm sure that's another battery waster.

Lastly, you have game volume and chat volume controls on the headset adapter. They have worked just fine so far, no complaints so far about that.

Pros:
Bass boost
Volume control (on the adapter not on cable)
Easy to assemble
Feels good on your ears

Cons:
Drains your batteries fast!
Only works 25% of the time
Audio/chat cuts in and out during game
Adapter has to be removed and put back in all the time to attempt to fix the connection.
Cheap looking/feeling Would not recommend, spend the extra money!"
2.0	this game was long awaited by many. i heard it was being released and said awesome finally a ufc game with a women's division. thats a plus. great graphics, check. now.........on to the game play, it seems that E A  spent all of their funds on graphic quality and zip on actual game play. the fighters are sluggish despite the weight class. the new combat damage system is mediocre at best 5 seconds after blood is spilled it disappears. and don't get me started on the entrances could they have shelled out the time to give these guys a more realistic intro. bottom line is this im a huge UFC fan but this game just isn't what we have all come to love about the UFC video games. big time let down
2.0	"Is this the worst game I ever played? No
Is this worth 60 bucks?  No.  Probably more like 20 or 30 dollars.
Will FPS non Alien fans like this game?  Doubt it.
Will die hard Alien fans eat this up?  Yes, thanks to the solid story that fills in some gaps in the Alien canon.

Lets do the bad, the ugly and the (few) goods

The bad:
Somewhat lousy controls
Mediocre weapons upgrade system
Very meh voice acting
Stupid AI enemies
Seemingly invincible AI teammates that do not die and shoot in random directions
Short campaign that is boring during single player
Clunky movement, derivative gameplay
Pointless addition of Weyland Yutani soldiers, killing Aliens is the fun part, not generic mercs
Lacks polish consistent with today's top notch FPS games

The ugly
Ridiculously ugly textures
Constant framerate issues
Tearing and other ugly bugs (walking through doors, invisible enemies, freezing)
Godzilla movie like lip sync problems (voices don't match lips)
Crazy lag at times in mutiplayer (even with a full connection) - very annoying as AI enemies freeze frequently
Laughable CGI quality (almost reminds me of Halo 1 quality)
No element of danger or surprise for the most part, which detracts from the spirit of the Aliens franchise
Environments are cool for a brief moment until the repetiton gets you
Constant reminders/feeling that this game is unfinished
Looked nothing like the prerelease demo
Gigantic plot holes that actually make things even more confusing in the Alien canon
Terribly unimaginative and boring final boss battle (you have been warned)
Lame ending that suggests a sequel (or more DLC)

The (few) good
Actually fun if you play co-op campaign, maybe bc you know others are slogging through the game w/you
Frantic, chaotic fun in co-op that is reminscient of the firefights in the Aliens film
Nice cameos by Alien franchise actors
Intersting storyline with lots of easter eggs for die hard Aliens fans

Bottom Line - Not a total fail as others have said but most definitely not for anyone other than die hard Aliens fans.  This game totally feels like it languished in development hell for 6 years and was done by multiple developers.  A missed opportunity.  Only check this out if you are nuts about Aliens, otherwise stay away.  I would have given this game a solid 1 star if not for the surprisingly fun co-op mode and the cool but confusing storyline for those of us who yearned for more after the Aliens film.

2.0	"square should've listed in game that when leveling up choosing to booste com, rav, sen, etc it doesn't add unlockable abilities, it just makes that role stronger (even if when characters r maxed all abilities r available certain roles would b helpful early on for specialized char.[for example ravangers,or comandos],i've yet to meet the person to actually read the manual) btw random battles should only be for overworld maps,& ff 13 (still the best) style battles , should be used out of an overworld. finaly gil was rare in ff xiii(until the end, when farming turtles,or sacrifices) ,but it's extreamly plentifull in xiii 2(about 400-1000 gil every battle, more if u sell the spoils). i know lots of ideas are pitched,but these ideas seem simple for even the most mistaken person.

weak time travel explanations, angry white boy battle music, unupgradeable items(best thing about 13), no classic victory jingle,& cinematic battle actions where u need to repeatdly press buttons(i used to b equiled in that area only by 1 person, i could siezurlike vibrate my arm at will,but i can't now thanks to a vicious wreck 6 years ago,& doctors). i hate to say this,but square has really dropped the ball with the ff 13 trilogy,but i have an idea for 3, yoshi,& the power rangers gain the ability to time travel ,& set out to right the wrongs of sepheroth.

another review for my fellow south parkateers
i'm trying to finish ff xiii 2,but u have a 3rd character slot thats filled with a creature u capture,& train(i keep hearing

gotta catch em all
gotta catch em
catch em
catch em
chimpokemon
that might b a normal side effect though)

i finished ff xiii(should've been only 1, like highlander)to c if it was explained y lightning was a warrior priestess of valhala,&y caius is attempting to destroy everything,but unfortunately i was disapointed yet again(later in the game its explained,but i was confused when this game just started like that). i'm trying to finish this game to c if there's a reason its on so many top 10 list. i must agree many of the problems of ff xiii were corrected (the greatest was combat,& splicing creatures like a mad scientist for the 3rd character),but new problems arose in their place which mostly have to do with angry white boy battle/chocobo (chocobo=giant chicken/horse) music(chocob's seemed so calm,& peacefull before),& crappy storyline(excellent combat doesn't make up for bad story/music on an rpg, not even close)

the ff xiii trilogy needs to undergo a quick,& relatively painless abortion to save us consumers time/money that would be wasted on future abominations (hope, alyssa, sazh,& dajh[sazh's boy] all seem to b vampires[never age], it was much cooler when vincent from ff 7 was a vampire, now all the worst characters r in the elite vampire fraternity). i'm playing augusta tower 400 AF,& i just learned that the AI went rogue,& started killing all the humans(all i could think of was skynet had just come to power ,but where r the terminaters)

2 major ways it improve on 1: the collecters catalog is way better, the collecters,  connesuers,& survivalists catalogs needed to b used separately before(they would detract from other each others spoils),& all items can be aquired at any time, all on 1 disc (but no treasure hunter achievement/trophy this time)

i like fang alot more than lightning, lightning,& snow(isn't he a self proclaimed hero?) should've created the pillar to hold cacoon aloft,& let fang ""save the timeline""(the time properties make no scence, how does affecting the future affect the past?)also y did etro share her heart with caius? (a person destined to b killed by a successor eventually,but if etro's heart stops beating the chaos of valhala'll infect the world, it seems to me that armagedon was the goal sought after)

i just read my new game informer (magazine),& this game was on the top 50 games of 2012 list. they conceded that the time travel story makes no scence(i would have to agree, after 300 years hope still looks 21),but it doesn't matter because the combat is great(the action can b great,but without an equally good story i don't care) as a parting shot i didn't realize how much i would loath moogles(my moogle is an idiot who can't go 2 sentences w/o saying kupo, if we're expected to like all knowing sagelike metal detectors, don't make them repeatedly say stupid things) excellent graphics/combat,but story was sacrificed for that(not a good trade)"

2.0	This is a futuristic dirt bike game, where rather than riding dirt bikes, you ride a jet-powered motorcycle. The game starts out being fun racing along exotic 3D courses like a jungle island, an earthquake rattled Los Angeles that has fallen into the sea, a cold mountain passageway and so on. When the player advances past the first few races the game stops being fun and starts getting unnecessarily and frustratingly difficult, because rather than having track borders (like walls) where the racer cannot go past a certain point, the courses further in the game take away those walls so you literally fall off the track. It is also unclear where the finish line is, sometimes you must do a lap around a circular track, and other times you must do a U turn then go back through the track. Then reappear on the track, far behind the other racers. The game is full of jumps, ridiculously high jumps, and while you are in the air you can do flips and tricks. Not any advanced tricks like from Tony Hawk. There are several racers, however the racers are so uneven that you can pick a certain racer and win constantly. High jumps, hard courses, uneven racers
2.0	"I AM ALIVE is a post apocalyptic survival game similar to the book / movie, The Road.  You're a lone wanderer making your way through a USA in ruins, as you try and find your wife and daughter.  On your adventure, you'll encounter people who need help, people who don't want your help, and people who want to dead so they can help themselves to your stuff.  The concept is good, but the game ends up with some pretty big flaws.

The Levels:
The game seems open ended like Fallout, but when you actually play it, you'll find that the maps are open, but the path to the next objective is extremely linear.  So, you'll find yourself aimlessly wandering around quite a bit.  As you wander, you will find some items that restore your health and stamina, but these are extremely rare.  Also, there are some invisible walls and areas that seem like they should be accessible, but aren't.  So, wandering is kind of a frustrating experience.  It would be great if there were multiple routes to the next checkpoint and you had a clue as to what they were.  Perhaps Option A is platform jumping.  Option B is combat oriented where you must kill 4 bad guys.  Option C would be a blend of A and B.  But there's only one way, and it's hard to find.

The Combat:
The Combat offers many options, but there really is only 1 way to win a fight.  In the game, you get a gun and a machete.  Bullets are scarce, but you can bluff enemies with an unloaded gun.  A guy with a machete will usually surrender or back off.  A guy with a gun will fire.  With your machete, you can KO a bad guy who surrenders.  You can also sucker slash an enemy who approaches you.  And you can fight a bad guy, grab him, and mash the stamina button to run him through. But, it's almost impossible to kill 2 machete guys with your machete, so, like the levels, the fights are linear, too.

Combat Example:  You are approached by 3 bad guys.  One has a gun, 2 have machetes.  You raise your hands as if you are unarmed.  One machete enemy approaches you to search you.  You press X to insta kill him, then immediately pull your gun and shoot the bad guy with the gun.  Then you fight the remaining machete guy with your machete.  Press X and Mash the stamina button to finish him.  That was the best way to win.  If there were more machete guys, you can pull your gun on them (loaded or unloaded) and get them to back off.  But those are all of your options.

If you began that fight by shooting a machete guy, the gun enemy would insta kill you.  If there are too many machete guys, bluffing doesn't always work and they hack you to death.  This isn't the type of game where you'll carry more than a few bullets at one time... usually just 1 bullet.  So, there's usually only one way to win a fight.

The Graphics:
They're post apocalyptic and everything is covered in dust.  So, it's a big grey world...  Kinda dull.

Player Decisions:
You occasionally meet other survivors who need an item like a first aid kit or medicine, and if you have these, you can help these people.  Unfortunately, that's about it.  This game is really lacking in player decisions and it would have been great if you could make more meaningful choices like in The Walking Dead Game.

Platforming:
The platforming mechanics are interesting, too.  You can climb and jump like in Assassin's Creed, but you have a stamina bar.  As you climb, the bar depletes.  When it fully depletes, you can mash the stamina button to keep going and try and make it to a safe ledge, but your MAX Stamina depletes as you are mashing the button.  You can replenish this with food or drink items in the game.  But because the game is linear, your only real decision is:  Do I want to fall to my death and do this more efficiently or waste a drink?

Continues:
You get 3 continues, and they are refilled at each Checkpoint.  You can also gain extra continues by finding them in the world or helping other characters.  Using a continue, will allow you to continue in that area right after you die.  If you elect not to continue, you begin at the last checkpoint, which could be 5 minutes of gameplay away.  To make matters worse, you CANNOT skip in game cinematics.  So, if you die 3 times in an area, you're watching that scene 3 times.  You can skip the pre-rendered story driven cutscenes, which helps a bit.  But it is still really frustrating to hear the same dialogue over and over and over.

At first, I Am Alive seems like this great open ended apocalyptic survival game where you can do all of these cool things.  But it is actually a linear game where you can only do what the designers wanted you to do or else you get heavily punished.

If you like difficult survival games in a post apocalyptic world, and you want to ration your power ups and ammo, then you may enjoy this game.  It's not an easy game, and you will feel like you've accomplished something when you finish it.

If you want open world survival games, play the Fallout Series.
If you want choices that affect other characters, play the Walking Dead from TellTale Games.
If you want a shooter, just know that this game isn't one. Overly Punishing and Repetitive"
2.0	"The idea behind the stuff packs is great but Maxis is going to have to work on the particulars for the packs to be a success. The artwork is lovely, the furniture very sleek and the outfits are great. However $19.99 is too much for my budget when this stuff pack only includes 60 items. Same as Family Fun I'm waiting until Glamour drops to $10-12.

Although the clothes for the adults are really nice I think it would have been good to add dressy clothes for elders and children too. The artwork is beautiful but it would have been a plus to have more from different eras. Same as the furniture. Glamour is more than just Art Deco. If they had included more styles in furniture and artwork I would have bought this immediately.

If Maxis really wants to compete with the custom content on fan sites they're going to have to increase the amount of stuff included in a pack or lower the price. There are many fan sites that have beautiful high quality custom content for free. Maxis is going to have to set the bar a little higher to grab my attention at the price they're asking. Too expensive at $19.99, wait for a sale"
2.0	"This product could be dangerous if you expect it to calculate a ""balanced diet"" for you. What it means by ""balanced"" is that the calories of the food you have consumed are sufficient to ""balance"" the calories you have expended. I had been reporting the food I had eaten (you pull various food icons from the different food groups over to a cartoon figure) for over a week but one day, when I had eaten too many carbs and not enough vegetables, I started to get uneasy. While the program said the diet was ""balanced"" I knew it was not nutritionally balanced. The next day I calculated my food exchanges on a piece of paper, but instead of what I had actuall eaten I put down that I had consumed nothing but chicken. The program said this diet was ""balanced"". The next day I did the same thing, only instead of what I had actually eaten I told the program I had eaten nothing but candy. Again, it said my diet was ""balanced"".

This game is good in that it offers incentive to exercise, and a lot of good information about nutrition. It is a shame that it fell short when it came to the ""food balance"" part. Surely information about the food pyramid and healthy food exchanges is not too difficult to program into a game? Instead of the wonky pedometer, the manufacturers could have included a small calorie counter.

I think Nintendo DS would be a great platform for a program that encourages exercise *and* helps you select a balanced diet. I am looking forward to it. ""Food Balance"" Section Measures Only Calories, Not Nutrition"
2.0	"It's ironic that a game developed in Poland would have no polish.  It's a huge game that has a bit of everything, but everything in the game feels a bit broken.  It's like playing an early beta of a promising title.

Story:  1/10
In the credits 7 people were credited with the story.  Here is your problem.  It's hard to get 2 people to agree on a creative endeavor, let alone seven people.  The story is poorly acted and disjointed.  Parts of it are good, parts are campy, and parts make no sense.  I wouldn't have been surprised if a bunch of enemies just started dancing to Gangnam Style in the middle of a boss battle.  There are even poorly recreated scenes from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Monty Python in the game!  It's face-palmingly bad.  To make matters worse, the main character only makes snarky comments about the adventure, which breaks immersion.  He says the same 5-6 things when he kills an enemy throughout the entire game: ""I'll bet you're glad you met me."" ""That's rich.""  ""Huhuhuhuh"" etc.  You can expect to hear these about 500 times each and they don't even really relate to what is going on.  The main character talks like a 16 year old playing D&D with his friends, rather than a mercenary risking his life on a quest.

Graphics: 5/10
They look dated, the environments are ugly, the characters are plain, and the animations are rough.  The particle and lighting effects are also primitive.  This game looks about 6 years old.  On the plus side, the art direction in some of the areas are kind of cool.  But you really don't want to play this after you've played Assassin's Creed Black Flag.

Character Classes / Inventory: 3/10
Fighter, Ranger, Mage are the basic archetypes, defined by their attacks.
Fighters can use a sword and shield, a two handed weapon, or dual weapons.  Blocking just reduces the incoming damage by a %.  They have special upgrades to take an enemy's shield away, a power smash to damage them through their shield, and various types of stuns.  There are a few special attacks for bonus damage as well.  All of the attacks are upgradeable for more damage or a better chance to Stun or Knockdown.

Rangers are interesting because of the bow upgrades.  They have explosive fire arrows, ice arrows that slow enemies, multi-shot which fires a bunch of arrows at a time, an illusionary distraction arrow, and upgrades that reduce the time it takes to draw an arrow.  If you fire and release quickly, you only do a small % of your max damage.  If you draw the bow all the way back, you do 100% of your max damage.  There's also an Overdraw skill that allows you to do bonus damage with your shots.

Mages have a complex spell creation system that allows you to choose a delivery system for the spell (Missile Aura, etc...) a damage type (Fire, Ice, Poison...) and then a modifier like guided, damage over time, etc...  The more powerful your spell, the longer it takes to cast.  But you also have upgrades that reduce casting time, so you can get your powerful spells out faster.  This is really complex, but rewarding when you craft cool spells.

Unfortunately, wearing quality armor reduces your accuracy stat (Bow Damage), which is a bad idea.  In a simple game like this, your gear and character classes shouldn't cannibalize themselves.  Elf Armor actually makes you worse with a bow in this game!!!

You can instantly swap between the 3 character pre-sets with the D-Pad. You can have 3 types of mages / a mage, fighter, and ranger / 2 fighter builds and a mage , etc.  It's up to you.  Customize your character sets any way you want.

It's too bad the Inventory is just a bunch of gear in boxes.  There's no way to really sort it and if you have equipped gear, it only shows on the character build you have selected.  So, if you have different boots for your fighter and different boots for your mage, and you are playing as the fighter, you might accidentally sell your mage boots because they show up as unequipped.  This is inexcusable.

Combat: Totally Broken
Your armor absorbs a % of incoming damage, the heavier the armor, the more it absorbs.  The attack animations feel very loose and make little effort to target an enemy.  Fortunately, the collision on the attacks is generous, so even if you slightly miss enemies, you hit them.  Many of the enemies have resistances to damage types, so choosing the right weapon for the job is crucial.  Some enemies can knock you down or knock you back.  The Knock Back attacks are broken because they always knock the player backwards no matter where he's facing.  So if an enemy pushes you from behind, you fall TOWARDS the enemy!!!  This is broken.  Unfortunately, none of this matters because enemies constantly get stuck on level geometry.  If you want to kill any enemy, just run around for a bit and they will get stuck on a wall, a tree root, a stump, a rock, etc... Then shoot them with a ranged weapon or spell until they die.  If you are in hallways and enemies attack, just run for a bit and the enemy decides he is too far from his starting point, so he starts to walk back.  Then shoot him in the back.  You can repeat this, until the enemy is killed.

The Good Stuff!
Lockpicking Mini-Game:
Locks are composed of a number of rings, more difficult locks have more.  Each ring has 2 catches in it.  The catches are opposite from each other.  So if 1 catch is at 12 O'clock, the other would be at 6.  When you begin lockpicking, a timer counts down.  Your lockpick moves in a circle around the rings.  When the pick is near a catch, just squeeze the R Trigger to advance to the next ring.  Repeat until you hit all of the catches.  Squeezing RT and missing a catch, will bump you back a ring.  This sounds simple, but it's actually fun and addicting.

Crafting:
If you kill enemies and get junk loot, you can scavenge it for parts.  Wood, Iron, Steel, etc...  Then use these parts to upgrade your gear.  So if you scavenge a bunch of weak enemy swords, you can upgrade your powerful sword.  Each upgrade gives you bonus damage for weapons and bonus defense for armors.  Every few upgrades also unlocks a socket.  You can fill these with gems that give you skill or stat boosts.

Bonus Skill Points:
If you kill a bunch of monsters, brew a bunch of potions, pick a bunch of locks, or craft a bunch of gear, you don't get XP.  Instead, you get an instant Skill Point you can use to upgrade any skill.  There are weapon skills for Fighters, Rangers, and Mages.  There are crafting skills, sneaking skills, alchemy skills, and skills that give your character natural damage resistances or stat boosts.  Use these Bonus Skill Points any way you want.

Leveling Up:
Kill Monsters and finish Quests to get XP.  When you get enough, you advance in Level.  You get 4 Attribute Points and 2 Skill Points per level.  Attributes = Health, Melee Damage, Missile Damage, Magic Damage and Mana Regeneration.  Weapons and Skills in the game are restricted by your Attributes.  So you may find an awesome sword, but you can't use it until your Strength is 35.  Or you may not be able to upgrade your Shield Bash Attack until you go up 5 more Strength.  The beauty of this system is that you can apply these points any way you want.  If you are a fighter and want to become a mage, you can level up your mage related stats and skills then instantly start using good spells.  You don't have to use magic to make your magic more powerful, so this system is extremely flexible.

Eyeballs:
These eyes are spells that allow you to scout ahead.  Release the eye and you be able to roam through the world for a specified amount of meters from your position.  Some eyes are single use and explode when they hit an enemy.  This is a great idea!

Sound: 6/10
The music of this game is atmospheric, but the voice acting is awful and ruins the atmosphere.

Maturity:  Older Teen / Young Adult
There's blood, drinking, swearing, and a partial nudity sex scene.

Value: 4/10
This game sells for about $5-$10.  It's 20-40 hours long and has multiplayer VS and Co-Op.  If you're dying for an action RPG, then you could pick this one up cheap to pass the time.

Overall: 4/10
This is a game with a little bit of everything.  Unfortunately, everything in this game has been done much better in other games of the genre.  Only play it if you're starving for an action RPG.  It's got some cool ideas and it is fun to level up your character or craft gear, but with the main components of the game glitching all over the place and a disjointed story that is not compelling, there isn't much of a reason to play this.
If you like Exploration and Open Ended Worlds, play The Elder Scrolls Oblivion and Skyrim.
If you like tight combat and great enemies, play Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen!
If you really want atmosphere and good combat, play The Witcher 2!
If you want to be a Pirate, play Assassin's Creed Black Flag!
If you want a horrific atmosphere and like dying, play Dark Souls!
If you want a game similar to this, but better, play Kingdoms of Amalur! An Open World Action RPG with No Polish What-so-Ever"
2.0	this item suck it doesn't work and it doesn't even charge the batteries. this is one of the worst product i have ever use and i wast my money on it. this item doesn't work
2.0	If you like Moba's this is for you.  However, be aware that it is EXTREMELY kiddy.  The voicelines in this game made me cringe.  I honestly played this game for a day and found it so bad, that I never touched it again. Yuck.
2.0	"This game is based on the recent Green Lantern movie (which was not that great in my opinion).

The graphics are very good, but the story for it isn't.

I just did not find this game enjoyable; it seemed more of a chore to get through than an adventure. It's just ok"
2.0	There are *so* many things wrong with this game but I still played it for hours and hours.  The voice-acting and cut-scenes are not bad ... they are shockingly BAD ... like wow that is the worse ever kind of bad.  The frame rate on horses is unplayable.  The guidance on how to play is basically missing.  The story is stupidly simple and the combat system is *very* simple.  Setting aside those things the game has a lot going for it.  The world is HUGE.  It nearly never crashes. The quests are not overly repetitive. There is nearly no dull farming.  There are many good looking mobs and places to explore.  The teleport system works nicely. The loot tables are huge.  Leveling goes at a good pace and you can upgrade and customize your character and his gear all over the place.  So, turn on subtitles, don't get a horse and be patient as you first explore.  Two worlds was a diamond that was ruined but it still has some sparkle if you can look past the flaws. Oh so broken but still fun
2.0	"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for the Wii is, in my opinion, a very bad game. The bad parts of this game are that the view is annoying and random, it skips over major parts of the story, teleports you at random points (for example I was in Occlumency class and then less than a second later without any explanation in the Order of the Phoenix headquarters at Christmas), has hardly any action, no puzzles, and is made up mostly of running around Hogwarts collecting students for this or that. The students who you are supposed to collect can never come with you until you do some stupid task for them. The good parts are that the Wii motions usually work and when they do work it feels a lot like you are actually holding a wand, the graphics are amazing for the Wii, and Hogwarts is gigantic and thoroughly detailed. All of those pros have a bad side to them though. When the Wii motions don't work it is really annoying, the graphics are only good from far away (when you look at close-ups things look really weird), and because Hogwarts is so big it makes the tasks insanely hard because you often need to go across the whole entire building looking for things or just getting something across the building. There's good music, but for some reason it usually isn't playing. Every word is voice-acted, which is a good thing, but there's so much unneeded and random talking in the game that the voices get really annoying. There are a bunch of unlockables, but no real reason to get them. You get videos and stuff when you find enough hidden stuff, but they're sort of boring.

Overall the only really good thing in this game is the amazing recreation of Hogwarts. If the price goes down somewhere around 5$ this game might be worth thinking about just so you can explore Hogwarts, but at any other price it just isn't worth it. Amazing castle, but overall terrible game"
2.0	"I am a big Sims 2 Fan and when I added the ""Kitchens and Bathrooms Interior Design Stuff"" Pack to my game, it really didn't do that much for the game play over all. Like all ""Stuff"" packs, they just add new stuff to give you more items for your kitchens and bathrooms. Would I recommend the item for other Sims2 fams? Yes, but with most stuff packs I found out there are a few bonus items used as insentive ""not"" included that should be. For example like most packs there maybe an item missing and special codes to obtain to get the items. When I was looking for bonus items eariler I came accross many items that I never realized were offered with each expansion or stuff pack as bonus offers. With the purchase of the pack you should get a code to unlock the item or items. I ordered the Kitchens & Bathrooms Interior Stuff Pack and never got a bonus code to give me a poster or a toilet paper holder or even some neat clothing. The only way I got the bonuses were to look for them as a large pack. Would I recommend this for you? Only if you are a hardcore simmer would I recommend If you got by without the new stuff before then you'll do just fine. Sims 2 Kitchens & Bathrooms Review"
2.0	Hated it and sold it Two Stars
2.0	I got this game hoping it'd live up to all the hype, but alas, it wasn't so.  For me, I have to be able to connect to the main character (after all, you're playing him/her for the majority of the game) but it was too difficult.  No matter how nice of a character I played, like helping the nuns and getting back stolen wagons, John was always saying how he was a terrible person and blah blah blah.  I also like games that tug more at my emotions, and only the event near the end really made me feel, well, anything throughout the entire game.  I got bored halfway through, and only trudged on just to see how it'd end and haven't even touched Undead Nightmare that came with it. Not my type of game
2.0	Spawn: The Eternal is a definite description of wasted potential.  Before this game came out it looked very promising, but when the long delayed game came out, Spawn fans were rather disappointed.  The graphics are very blocky, not to mention Spawn looks like an overgrown ape.  The controls are plain old unresponsive, and overall the game feels rushed and unfinished.  However, there are some pros, the game has an eerie atmosphere, and the sound is great as well, but the fighting engine when you face off against enemies seems like a joke no one is laughing at.  The levels in the Tomb Raider-esque parts of the game look too similar to one another, and once you beat the game you'll never want to play it again, not to mention the ending doesn't solve anything.  All in all, hardcore fans of Spawn (like myself) may find a bit of fun in this, but others should steer clear. Could have been great
2.0	"This game is just weak, no strong quality that u would hope for
pros:
1 lots of dbz caracters
2 fun for few secs
cons:
1 waste of money
2 it needs a adventure mode
3  you will get tierd of it You got half a hour"
2.0	The graphics and game play of this game take FPS to a whole new level. Unfortunately due to the bugs and glitches i was unable to complete the campaign. After having to restart the entire game after making it towards the end, i had enough. Now the game is being used to rest my drinks on while playing call of duty..... good game, very buggy
2.0	Of course I would give this game only 2 stars. It's okay, it has its quests and missions like My Sims, but the regular My Sims is better. It might just be me, considering the fact My Sims had lower ratings than this. I sold this game and a couple others for $50, so I'm quite happy with my decision. Why keep a game you'll never play? My Sims is Better
2.0	This game is garbage. If you don't believe me then go ahead and  waste your money. I honestly don't know why Amazon's charging this much for this steaming pile. Here's a short rundown. Tons of items, but they are all mostly used for the same thing, so it's mainly just for show. Items randomly generate everytime you enter an area, and they seem to pop up in the most dumb places that as far as I know are not even possible to be reached. The areas are so much of a backdrop that the characters don't even look like part of the scene and they have terrible interaction with the environment. The voiceovers are chiildish and super corny and half the characters talk in that anime smurfy little kid voice. Skills are just for show and the basic attack is all you will really need to use. The world map is a top down view and just a bunch of pasted pictures that you enter by pressing X, and they're connected by drab brown trails. Most cities and places only consist of 1 screen, this game is a joke. Buy Dragon quest 8. Generic in every way. This game was definitely rushed.
2.0	"Some Windows XP systems (such as mine) will experience constant crashing. As in every couple of minutes, or every time you save. I can still manage to play by saving (it usually crashes after you save, luckily), quitting if it didn't crash, and restarting, but that gets old after a few hundred repetitions. Funcom doesn't seem interested in releasing a fix for the problem or acknowledging that it exists.

It also sometimes stops responding to the mouse if you switch to another application (such as an instant message popping up), and the textures always get hosed if you switch, so that also is effectively a crash.

Also, saved games in the first slot cannot be restored, so you may find yourself confused at the very beginning.

It's a bit long-winded... sort of the longest-winded journey, and you may want to use subtitles so you can read parts and then right click in the dialog or hit escape to skip to the next audio segment. Similarly, you'll want to use escape frequently to run instead of walking, or double click to move to run. Constant crashing under XP"
2.0	The most boring game you will ever play. Put gasmask on. Take gasmask off. Two Stars
2.0	My review is not for the game but the port. i get frustrated playing off line because the xbone says the dlc is not on the console but it is My review is not for the game but the port ...
2.0	I was not happy that the triggers received are not the same as the ones illustrated in the picture. I would not have bought them if I knew they looked the way they do. Out of the four received, two of them are defective. One has a broken hinge and won't go on at all and the other fits on at a very strange angle. 2 stars for at least 2 fitting on the controller correctly. false advertisement and defects.
2.0	"I just purchased this game used at gamestop and I thought I was getting a great game since i missed every street fighter after ex plus alpha. Pure disappointment. The graphics are beautiful! But the gameplay is awful. Same moveset, Even worse, the ps one street fighters had more special attacks, moves, and characters. I played the game for 3 hours and just got frustated. I am pretty good at street fighter but Zangief is a cheat on this game he endures attacks and then grabs you repeatedly and its hard to stop. And for the ""new moves they said the characters had"" all capcom did was add a cinematics.

I repeat this game is a rip-off and you are better off getting TEKKEN, marvel vs capcom 2 or any other street fighter from the ps one series, any tekken will do excluding 1 and 4. The graphics are phenominal. The controls are the same as sega genesis controls. Meaning if you know how to do a hadoken with Ryu on sega, then you will know how to do one on ps3. Street Fighter IV lacks character selection. This game has horrible combination selection, because it's so basic for a next gen console. You cant even side step, everything is up, down, left or right. I will get my refund tommorow. In conclusion this game gets a two rating just because the game was created with so much hype and the graphics, everything else is just below average!,

Ps you will never go wrong with Tekken. Great characters, great movesets, lots of moves, counters, and graphics.

Tekken for life! Please just stick to SF II or ex plus alpha if you want a good game."
2.0	I personally didn't like this at all.  It was to difficult for the children (ages 8-14) and they have not played it more than four or five times.  I was dissapointed with the whole things.  Graphics are OK, but the gaming experience is just boring. Didn't like it... difficult for children and ... boring for the grown ups.
2.0	It works, but the quality is terrible. DO NOT buy this for an HD TV. The only reason to buy this particular cable is if you play your PS3 or PS2 on a old tube TV. There, you won't be able to tell the difference. Garbage HD component cables for PS3
2.0	"Well, I played Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 and couldn't get enough of it. The game play in the Roller Coaster Tycoon series has a feel to it much like any simulation game in that you must try your best to keep some form of balance working in the place you are given. Building Coasters and then watching people ride them alone with trying to keep your park clean and full of other rides, attractions, and shops keeps you glued to the screen for hours.
That being said, this game really is not much improvement on the first one. The graphics are now even more dated then ever. You cant get a very big close up on the people in the park and that makes things a bit more dull. Also, the only real improvements I can see is the new scenery (which doesnt make much difference in the park rating) and the fact that some of the rides are based on rides from Six Flags.
One problem is that if your park has been designated as a pay-at-the-door park, you can not charge a dime for the rides, even if you want to. And as stated before, The graphics of the game play has not changed at all, which makes the game seem like more of an expansion pack to Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 then it does a new game.
So in closing, While the game isn't that great, if you have twenty bucks to blow and are as addicted to the first one as I am, go ahead and get it. Otherwise, don't bother. I am curious to see if Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 (if they make one) will be more entertaining then this game. ehh....Could have been much better"
2.0	My son against my wishes is taking interest in hunting. Bought him this but its only been used a couple times. Not interested in the game. wasnt a hit with 9 year old
2.0	The game is awful and the amiibo functionality is dumb and works against the portability aspect of being on a handheld console. If you want the Amiibo, just buy that, but avoid this terrible title. The game is awful and the amiibo functionality is dumb and works against the portability aspect of being on ...
2.0	I've had 3 of these official batteries and it seems like they don't last more than 4-5 months before they crap out... I don't even abuse them in any way, I'm a light gamer. The last battery I had lasted about 6 charges and I went the last month or so without going on my Xbox much. When I went to plug my play and charge kit back in the light would only stay red for a few seconds and then it would turn green like it was finished charging. When unplugged the controller will not start. Basically I have a wired controller now. I love when the thing actually worked but it seems to die way too quickly. Save your money and just get rechargeable AA batteries. Great for about 5 months...
2.0	"First off EA took somthing that was perfectly good dating all the way back to playstation 1 and flushed it completely down the toilet. They made it like call of duty which is completely overrated to begin with. Secondly all the game gives you is four small measley health squares. If you get hit once thats one square gone. I tried playing it on ""Normal"" and died everytime. I completed one objective and it didn't save I died trying to get to another objective and had to start the mission all over again because it didn't save! The worst game I've played in a long time."
2.0	This could be considered the companion to Alien Trilogy as it takes place in the Fourth Movie following the first three presented in Alien Trilogy.  This game featured controls that people are more familiar with in these days, but didn't understand at the time.  The controls may be above average, and the graphics are excellent for the time, but seriously, the level design is a piece of crap!  What kind of space ship is this?  Very illogical design leads to BORING gameplay that is only fun for 5 minutes with invincibility turned on, otherwise you'll die in 2 minutes without it because you move soo slow.  An interesting thing is that if you get impregnated by a facehugger you won't be allowed to go through airlocks or elevators, which is interesting that they followed through on this principal with the chestbursters, and you'll have to find a device to take out the creature before the time runs out.  The thing that doesn't make sense with this is that even with a chestburster inside you, aliens will attack you, and that makes no sense.  Facehuggers can also attack you by hitting you with their tails.  Don't play this game, I'd rather watch the movie. Ahead, and behind it's time.
2.0	1-1/2 years after release, it still has bugs and sometimes refuses to run. Two Stars
2.0	I've been playing these games since they came out and this one was horrible compared to the first 3. The whole alien idea was ridiculous. The side missions were lame and so were the main missions. They should have stuck to the same normal concepts as the first 3. Those were so much fun to play. I won't be buying the next Saints Row game which looks similar to this game. When they start making games like the original 3 I will start playing again. ... games since they came out and this one was horrible compared to the first 3
2.0	After about 6 months of lite use, the battery won't connect to the console. It is still nice for a grip but don't expect much more unless you can solder the connections back together. Battery doesn't last
2.0	"I enjoy a challenge, but this game it way too hard. It's not fun to fail a mission more than tens times. Plus when you fail it offers you a chance to retry but you still have to go through all the talking again.(which is ANNOYING & BORING)

This game could have been fun, but it's too hard. The patients vitals drop way too quickly. And there's pretty much only 1 way to do each mission. I had to look at a walk through to get through every other mission. There were a couple of times I wanted to snap the frickin' DS in half. (Of course I didn't)

I'm just really glad I didn't buy this game. Too Difficult"
2.0	$36 for a damn memory card. Up yours Sony. A SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC is less than 25 bucks. That is a pretty terrible price to storage ratio. Ripoff
2.0	Was not impressed with this video. It is okay but not one of my favorites. Two Stars
2.0	Typical rail shooter with all the illogic that comes with it. I got it for $10 and it was worth that price.  I wouldn't pay much more for it.  It's longer than most modern day FPSs and the story is pretty good.  However, when you have to search for certain items within your own base to hand to a person sitting at the same base, I wanted to pull my hair out.  We don't need fluff like that in a good game. It's longer than most modern day FPSs and the story is pretty good. However
2.0	It was just not, my cup of tea. Way to corriagraphed and linnier. I enjoyed Max Payne 1&2 for PS2. Those were also linnier but that was PS2. I expected more from Max Payne 3 but I was disapointed bigtime. Way Overated
2.0	I'm new to the franchise and stopped playing after the 3rd boss due to the difficulty which is supposed to be normal. The AI seems broken at times and the blocking rarely works. Probably best for people who are familiar with the franchise and not the casual gamer. No easy difficulty.
2.0	I was so elated to find out Konami was releasing a new version of the SNES classic Contra 3 for the Gameboy Advance.  To my disappointment, I didn't find myself having as much fun with this version as I did several years ago on my old 16 bit machine.  My biggest gripe is that the game walks the fine line between excessively challenging and unenjoyably frustrating.  What were the developers thinking?  You can no longer toggle between weapons; rather whatever you pick up is what you shoot with.  This wouldn't be a major issue if certain weapons weren't useless in certain situations.  There are also no more bombs so you better pray you have quick reflexes to get you out of those super tight spots.  Aside from the difficulty issue, the only other major flaw is the archaic password/save feature which is totally inconvinient for a portable game.  Everything else is actually O.K.  The game looks just like the old SNES version and has aged quite gracefully making for a really nice looking portable game.  Controls are tight and alleviate some of the stress from the frantic learning curve.  If your looking for an insanely hard shooting game (and I mean INSANELY HARD) for those long car rides, by all means Contra Advance is a perfect choice.  For those looking for a game that is a little more enjoyable and rewards skill rather than luck, you should go somewhere else; and for the old Contra fans, pick it up used for some old thrills, then pull out your SNES and really put some time into the old game. Not How I Remember It...
2.0	This item is ok for older people who like fishing. I thought i was going to break it and the remote didn't fit to good inside the rod fishing
2.0	Worked great for about two months, then the left ear quit working. Verified that it's a headset issue with multiple devices. Too bad because it's comfortable and sounds really good, especially for the price. Two months of good, then the left ear stopped working.
2.0	As one who's played EVERY final fantasy, chalk this one up as a disappointment. In full disclosure, I favor the classic final fantasys such as FF4 FF6 and FF7.  This one just doesn't cut it.  Viewed without comparison, it's surely a good game, but is a disappointment considering its Final Fantasy title. Final Fantasy Fanboys - Prepare to be Disappointed
3.0	This seems like a Sims knock off, and I'm not a big Sims (people) fan.  Basically you teach the characters to forage and research and reproduce.  I'm sure it would be fun for those who like the Sims types games but I just found it boring. Not for me
3.0	Even though the missions do get a little repetitive, it's still a pretty fun game. I picked it up at gamestop for 10 dollars, it being an old game,( the only reason i bought it there is i had a gift card, btw) it's basically like GTA on mars.... with a hammer. the building destruction is pretty awesome, and there is alot to keep you entertained i'd buy it for the price on amazon. Nice
3.0	didnt care for this one much outside of some songs; Symphony of Destruction, You got another thing comin and Cowboys from hell. It's ok for being the first.
3.0	game is ok Three Stars
3.0	"It's a FPS, plain and simple.  There are some kinda-unique elements to the game; there's stealth abilities, the graphics are very good, the story is passable, the intro and cut scenes are awesome.  The problem is that it's... muddled.  In most instances, stealth is an option, but more often than not, someone or something notices you, and completely kills that option.  The game then becomes; run into an area, have the bad guys notice you and shoot at you, you hide and pop out from time to time to take them out / let your sheilds recharge.  Rinse and Repeat.  The bad guys get boring real quick.  Couple different soliders, couple different aliens.  Yay.  The weapons are nicely done, and the sound effects are good.  Control is solid.  But, it doesn't ""wow"" me.  It's like Halo, only different. It's like HALO."
3.0	"I hated Batman: Vengeance and I was a little bit weary about playing this game. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually a fun little beat-em-up in the tradition of Streets of Rage and Double Dragon. However it is still quite a shallow game.

Each level looks exactly the same as you (as Batman, Robin, Batgirl or Nightwing) run around levels like the City Streets, the Sewers, Museums etc and beat-up generic looking villains. The graphics and levels look pretty but the scenery is rather flat and unengaging. Plus the upgrades with special moves are hardly that exciting though it is slightly fun using them to kick-in the heads of evil henchmen. But when you do it for the forty-millionth time it does get a bit boring.

And every level involves either defusing a bomb against 3-minute time limits and rescuing hostages against 3-minute time limits. Wow! But, like I said, it's still far better than Vengeance and the cut-scenes look lovely. And for the tiny amount of pennies that I paid for it I can hardly complain really. An improvement but still lacking greatness"
3.0	"Super Paper Mario, the latest in a series that began with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paper-Mario/dp/B00004U1R3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paper Mario</a>&nbsp;on the N64, initially impresses with bright graphics and charming visual effects, but is dragged down by its gameplay.

The game has some good ideas: the various characters and helpers (""Pixls"") have diverse abilities, and many situations require the player to make intelligent choices about which character/helper combination to use.  This installment of the series does away with turn-based battles in favor of what is basically  platforming gameplay with RPG elements (e.g., hit points and levels), and the integration is surprisingly smooth.

The fun factor takes a dive, though, as too many areas feature lengthy backtracking and counterintuitive or arbitrary puzzle solutions.  The game often presents puzzles without the slightest hint of what to do with them--or it uses the environment inconsistently; for example, boxes that normally turn only red or blue suddenly also turn orange and black--but only in one specific part of the game, and with no warning.  Super Paper Mario's gameplay is relatively easy, but its often opaque puzzles can quickly make it frustrating.

On a different note, the game's English translation sparkles, with distinct and often hilarious dialogue for each character--a good thing, since this must be one of the talkiest Mario titles ever.  The dialogue is packed with winking references and sly send-ups of other Nintendo games that should delight long-time fans.  Unfortunately, the story proper is completely predictable, if unusually dark for a Mario game.  There are also hundreds of collectibles in several categories (Recipes, Catch Cards, Maps), but the unappealing gameplay gives scant motivation for extra scrounging after the main story is over.

Super Paper Mario is cute at first, but too many sloppy design elements end up making it hard to love.  Luckily, its spiritual ancestor, the superb SNES game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-RPG-Legend-of-the-Seven-Stars/dp/B00002SVG3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</a>, is now available on the Virtual Console.  It costs less and is a vastly more satisfying game.

3.0	"343 improved with Halo 5! Loving it so far!

Updated: After completing the games campaign the storyline was horrible. But the online multiplayer is good. Not a very good storyline"
3.0	"My grandson just loves trucks and this is a perfect truck simulation for him.  It is frustrating though, to have to go through the entire trutorial before you can proceed to the actual ""work"".  The program is supposed to allow you to build your experience and then be able to purchase more equipment.  Our experience has shown that if you do not complete a job (or the tutorial) upon one sitting, you have to start all over again the next session.  Documentation is no help and  contacting the maker by email was no help because we have been ignored.  The game is fun, but just needs to be more friendly on the support side.  Also, cars in the street environment sometime litterally crash, flip, then disappear!  Why?  What does this have to do with sweeping streets?  So, in summation, I would rate this 5 star with better documentation and with a solid assurance that work completed would be stored for the next session. Needs better documentation"
3.0	it has better gameplay considering it's on the ps4 but is it worth the money and not getting dlc ?probably not okay but not worth the price of admission
3.0	works ok, little glitchy here and there when playing retro games, you will need another controller for using SNES or above though, cause of lack of buttons and triggers, but for SMB 1 and 2 works good. but for SMB 1 and 2 works good.
3.0	The mouse input itself is solid, but there is raised plastic where the tip of your thumb rests that is annoying. Also the side button towards the front of the mouse is very pointy and is uncomfortable to click and to rest your thumb near. I'm half tempted to file it and the raised plastic part down, which would make it more comfortable. Pointy side button & raised plastic make this uncomfortable to use.
3.0	I've been a fan of the mystery dungeon spin-offs since I played Blue Rescue Team when it first came out. This one is gorgeous and has a cute storyline from what I have seen so far, but the thing that is throwing me off from truly enjoying the game is the forced storyline. It won't let me wander off and train a bit in the dungeons so I end up dying all the time. It's getting very frustrating so I had to take a break from this game. I've been a fan of the mystery dungeon spin-offs since ...

3.0	"3.5/5
Im going set aside the debacle that followed the launch of Evolve and concentrate on the game since it went FTP, which is when I started playing it (it was on my wishlist and I probably wouldve bought it eventually). Coop gaming lives or dies with the team. They can be great fun to play provided you have a decent team, but if your team does not cooperate, or is poorly-matched, well, it soon goes down the pan. In this respect ES2 suffers more than most. If you're lucky enough to get a cooperative, well-matched team of hunters, against a well-matched monster, it can be really enjoyable. If you don't have such a team it can be extremely frustrating, especially if poorly-matched hunters are pitted against a high-level monster. Due to the low number of players (it averages around 400 at the time of writing) there is no matchmaking to speak of and teams are often badly balanced as a result. There are also too few players who enjoy playing as monster which can lead to long waiting times. And yet despite all of these gripes I keep going back to the game because I love coop, and when it does go well it really is a satisfying game. I think Turtle Rock missed an opportunity with Evolve: there is the basis for a really good game here but, for whatever reasons, they dropped the ball. And I can understand why many people lost patience or grew bored with the game. But if you enjoy coop, and have a little patience, EVOLVE STAGE 2 is worth a try. Survival of the mismatched"
3.0	As far as turn based rpg goes, this is one of the best that's out there.  A very well put together game that's worth your time if you like rpg's. This is excellence in rpg gaming
3.0	"Some thoughts on ASSASSIN'S CREED UNITY:

* I played the PS4 version.
* I do not have the same frame rate issues that others are reporting.
* I think it's not one of the best of Assassin's Creed (AC) games. Having played most of them, I like Black Flag, the Assassin's Creed 2 games, and AC1 better, but like this more than Assassin's Creed III.
* This game pales in comparison to Shadows of Mordor and Assassin's Creed Black Flag.
* The movement in this game is often erratic. I always find that I get more comfortable with the movement in these games as I play them, but I think this game is particularly bad.
* The game feels buggy and glitchy overall. The animations are not as fluid as in other AC games and Shadows of Mordor, NPCs behave weirdly reasonably often, clipping, etc. However, I did not see any gamebreaking crashes or bugs which made me restart a mission/reload the game.
* Combat is about par compared to previous games in the series, but much worse than in Shadows of Mordor.
* Paris is a good setting for the game. AC gameplay benefits from the city streets, as opposed to open terrain, as in much of AC3 and Black Flag.
*In previous games, I really enjoyed the Abstergo/future storyline, but in the more recent games have stopped caring. The plot is overly convoluted and there's very little advancing of the narrative going on.
* Arno is a decent enough character though, and I enjoyed his storyline, but I wish that the rich history of the French Revolution was brought into the game more.
* Paris seems too chaotic, there's too much random robbing and looting going on. It can be distracting, and you'll get random events occurring during (at least some of the) missions, which can get in the way/become problematic.
* Did not try the multiplayer missions.
* Integration with the web games leaves something to be desired, in my opinion. I have heard that they are not very fun, and I'm not really interested in participating anyways. Am bummed that I have to do this in order to unlock some of the game's content.
* In short: if you haven't played Shadows of Mordor or Black Flag, play those first. If you like both of those games and still want more on a current gen console, Unity may be what you're looking for. Just don't set your expectations too high.  I enjoyed playing this game - just not up to the quality of some of the previous games I've mentiioned. Parts of This Game Are Fun, But Prefer Others in the Series - Here's Why:"
3.0	Broke with in the first few months of  having it Three Stars
3.0	"This isn't a bad game per say, but it's not the next-generation Sly Copper game I waited 8 years for.

Pros:
Graphics look great. Just what I'd imagine a Sly game on the PS3 to look like.

The RC Car handles a lot better than it did in Sly 3.

Picking pockets has a higher pay out.

Cons:
Load times are way too long.

The game is jam packed with mini games (there's a mission that is just a bunch of mini games).

Playing as Murray sucks (he played a lot better in the other games)

I could go into more details but I just wanted to get my major points across. In short the Cons out way the Pros. Also does anyone feel like the jumping doesn't feel right, I can't put my finger on it but some thing feels off. 8 years later."
3.0	"This is one of those games that really furthers the medium of video gaming with its amazing visuals and emphasis on story and characters. That said, I couldn't help feeling, as I got further into the game, that it was not really breaking boundaries from a gameplay perspective. The one thing that really makes the game unique, trying to read people's faces to tell whether they're being straight with you, could have been done just as well on the Sega CD. The only difference would be that you would have been watching actual film of actors instead of (sometimes realistic, sometimes creepy) head scans of actors. It's amazing tech, it truly is, but it's unnecessary, as is the action of putting any effort into playing the game correctly.

Going in, I was expecting an adventure game with a light sprinkling of GTA elements, which is more or less what I got. What really sets the game apart from other adventure games (or action games, for that matter) is the fact that you can literally fail at everything and still finish the game. Rather than causing the player to repeat an interview if he messes it up, the game simply provides an alternate way to continue, usually tailing a car, that will allow the story to move forward. And if you continually fail at something like tailing a car or some other action scene enough times, the game will allow you to simply skip the scene. So, when it comes down to it, the game provides no challenge, at least not in the traditional sense. The motivation to do well in interviews is there, because failing those will actually change elements of that particular story chapter, but there is no reason to succeed at the action sequences.

Aside from the action scenes and the interviews, there are times when you'll need to walk around a crime scene or a suspect's house and collect evidence, but this boils down to simply walking around and picking up stuff until a musical cue tells you you've found everything. Yes, it's part of the detective experience, but it's not particularly engaging.

So, the main reason to buy the game comes down to the interviews. That's the big selling point. And I personally thought they were a bit messy. You're supposed to use your gut to tell if people are lying or not. Some people I know say that it's ridiculously easy to tell when people are lying, but I never felt like I knew what I was doing. I messed up many interviews and probably ended up not getting the best story in most of the chapters. I thought about trying to play through the game again to get the better endings, but I didn't feel that the game was enough fun to warrant another playthrough.

If you want my personal opinion, I'd say that this would have made a better movie than a game, but then again, if it were a movie, there are better movies out there in the same genre, so just go watch one of those.

I hope developers don't give up on the detective genre in games. It has the potential to be very engaging. It's just not quite there yet. Technically, it's an amazing game."
3.0	"its a great collection, and it has a very neat feature that makes all the games play in a row, but there's one downside to that mode: you can only play it in ""easy"" for the first playthrough, and easy mode doesn't just make the game easier, it makes all your powerups fully leveled-up and unlocked from the start... which ruins the fun of finding them in the game. its great if you play every game seperately though, but the full story mode left me disapointed and bored. Great but flawed collection"
3.0	These lil motion adapters are a good deal but you just have to rest them and sometime just let the computer shut down to regroup else you run the risk losing the sync with the wii console, other than that, its a retty good deal and definately better than buying another whole controller for 40.00. Good deal until they stop working
3.0	"I was so excited for a new smash and was expecting something far more than I received. To put it simply, this is a glorified version of the Wii version Brawl but with a terrible single player mode, unbalanced characters, OP items, 1 kill weapons that spawn like crazy, somewhat broken blocking, and busted mechanics that make this a pure button masher. This is only worth buying for online and multiplayer, but totally not worth full retail price. I played for a few hours then put in Brawl and went back to Melee. Both are better, still nothing quite beats Melee. If you want this game, I seriously suggest the 3DS version instead. At least that has street pass additions and you can take it with you.

I'll start out with the biggest new thing, Amiibos. This is purely a money grab. It really adds nothing to the game. I was entertained by it for a few minutes but after about 20 minutes of battling my Amiibo and getting it up to level 17 I just saw no point in doing anything else with it. It may add something to other games in the future but it's yet another accessory Nintendo made to get some extra income that has no real advantage or features. You're not missing anything by not owning one.

Single player is terrible, easily the worst of the series. There's no true adventure mode in this one. There's a sort of challenge stage thing and then a master hand challenge stage thing. It's kind of boring and the challenges are nothing new, we've seen them all before in adventure mode in Brawl. This game's entire focus is getting trophies and putting patches on your Mii or Amiibo fighter. The features in single player are lacking and there's really nothing worth playing this over and over for since it's the exact same thing you do in every smash. Play classic and all-star, beat it with every character, get trophies, look at how much time you wasted to unlock a couple characters.

Multiplayer is the only fun thing. The online is pretty good and spectator mode is sometimes fun to watch. I didn't buy the Gamecube adapter only because it doesn't work with any other games and that's a huge disappointment for how expensive that adapter is so I haven't tried 8-player. No items is the only way you can play this and not instantly hate the game. Even then you learn quickly how everyone picks the same characters and it's just all OP fighters vs you wanting to play with a fun character. Essentially I can't take this game seriously or think of it as fun because of how unbalanced the fighters are.

Some characters have hit priority and cancel moves that actually shouldn't work the way they do. Everyone already knows how unfair Little Mac is. Some characters also block at different speeds and blocking is actually slower than before, not a quick switch. Rolling is very inconsistent between fighters and grabs don't always trigger but only with some fighters. Many of the characters have incredibly weak hits and you can spend forever trying to damage people only to almost instantly be at 80% damage from certain characters. The gravity in this is a little weird as well and it makes some characters incredibly vulnerable based on their move sets. The balance just isn't there and they had already patched the game on launch day to balance, but actually made it worse.

Stages. They're well done and there are a lot, but almost every stage that changes up has portions that are unplayable because they have sections that are fall to your death layouts. Especially if you're playing a fast character. I like a lot of the stages but the majority of them have chunks of their layout changes that are just not fun. The character selection is vast but many of the characters are not fun to play as and almost everyone you see online uses the same 10 characters. What's the point of a huge roster if no one even uses those characters?

A lot of people seem to love this game and I can understand why people love it, especially if your main focus is just multiplayer and collecting trophies. Why in 2014 are people going on and on about ""the graphics"" as though it really even matters anymore or to a game like this. This game overall just feels like the street fighter cash in. I expect the next one to have nothing but single player and multiplayer with no extra anything and 80 characters with 100 stages. After days of playing this I just got bored and went to other games. Maybe if they actually balance the game (which everyone ignores) the game will be worthwhile. How many times will you buy the same game?"
3.0	"Third update:  I've decided to downgrade this game from 4 stars to 3 stars.  Why?  Mainly, after playing it for probably 60 hours, I got totally bored with it.  First, it is just too repetitive.  Primarily, this is because the areas you went into before, are always under the same state of combat to one degree or another.  There is absolutely no satisfaction to clearing out an area, then going someplace else, happen to come back to the same area, and having either to clear it out again, or try to skip/run through it doing as little combat as possible.  It just feels totally unrealistic that the spawns never stop, and that gets really old, fast.  Second, there are merchants of varying types everywhere, but what you can do with them is always the same... sell off your junk, and ignore what they have to sell, because everything they carry is ALWAYS less effective than what you have.  Sometimes you can buy food and other temp boosters, but in actuality, you will have no use for them, because the combat is so fast and the keystrokes needed to use such items are impossible to keep track, requiring you to effectively be a Data from Star Trek to keep up with the command pace.  Third, the one set of continuing missions get SO HARD, SO FAST, that you effectively have to go do MANY other things to level up a BUNCH of times, just to have a chance at doing the next mission step.  Having to spend a couple of days in this sort of activity quickly detracts from any story line that exists in those missions.  Finally, I finally decided to try World of Warcraft for the first time, which effectively is a similar game as GW2, but FEELS like a MUCH more interesting world, and a MUCH larger world too.  I imagine most people who are considering GW2 have already played WoW, and I'm suggesting they may be as disappointed in GW2 as I have now become.

Second Update:  I'm not sure what I did, but I now have a mini-map showing up.  So, that problem is resolved.  As I play the game, I still get frustrated with other limitations I've run into.  For example, there is no place to store stuff... like a chest that you ""own"" in some location, so I could put stuff I'm not sure if I want to keep it or not.  The amount you can carry is pretty limited, even with additional bags.  In the beginning, the limit is 4 extra bags.  I have found a red bag, which appears to be double the brown bags, but I cannot install it.  I don't know if this is because my character is not high enough level or what.  The ability to make stuff is kind of neat, but I've found even though I've made quite few pieces of stuff, that eventually you can put together to make a usable item, so far, at level 14, I've not been able to make a single thing... and, I suspect that even if I could make a finished item, chances are, it would be far inferior to the items I find from kills in the field.  So it would appear this skills stuff is totally worthless, at least in the early part of the game.  I wish that they would have set up chat so you could do it live with headphones & microphone... taking time to type in chat messages is generally dumb simply because there's a pretty good chance that there will be a battle nearby and you may get attacked.  This game is pretty hard if you play alone.  It is really meant to be played with a few others.  Battles for loners are very difficult and often totally impossible.  While I find some aspects of the game fascinating, I cannot say that I'm really having any actual fun playing it.  That is, it's fairly repetitive and sort of boring.

UPDATE: I had complained that this game's movement controls were horrid.  However, a comment gave me the answer that I had missed.  There is a control for increasing rotation speed, which defaults to ""snail"".  I changed it to half way across the bar, (rat speed?) and now the game plays GREAT.  So am increasing the stars to 4!  Want to play more before seeing if I want to rate it a 5 or not.  I still wish there was a mini-map.  There was nothing in the options for something like that.

Original Review starts here:

In general, I like the game, as the world is pretty large, the music is pleasant, the exploration is wonderful, and the challenges are many.

But there is one absolutely horrid aspect to the game.  The movement controls.  You have multiple choices on trying to maneuver your character around the screen.  You have the standard W-A-S-D keyboard controls, which in themselves are absolutely horrid as those controls are forward,left-backward-right directions only, but the game is 360 degrees around you, as you're playing from a birds eye view of your character.  They added different options with the left and right mouse buttons, one rotates your view and the other rotates your character itself.  This makes movement so confusing it can drive you crazy.  The best movement I have found is pushing your left and right mouse buttons down simultaneously, which will then move your character in the direction you are facing... BUT, if you want to turn, for example, 35 degrees to the right, you have to find your cursor on the screen, and roll it to that new desired direction.  Because rotation in this way with a mouse is painfully slow, if you're in a tight battle, you're likely to get killed pretty fast.  It also gets bad even just running here and there, because there is NO mini-map in the corner of the screen like on other games of this genre.  The most perfect game I can think of that has great movement controls is Skyrim.  Guild Wars 2 could have been a great game, but the movement controls make it painful to play. This would have been a 5 star review but for one thing - UPDATED"
3.0	I have been a Spyro fan since the start and I must say that after trying the demo, I was very disapointed.  I already found things I didn't like or missed from the YOD.  This is terrible. Already disapointed
3.0	okay first of all, this game like any other final fantasy is different from each other which is good but you have got to know how  to divide yourself from your predecessor. This game was very good on certain standards but i Expected more. I have played every final fantasy and this one is in between the good final fantasy and the bad final fantasy. I liked this game and in fact i own this game but i was dissapointed. Overall, it is a game to check out. MAYBE THEY TRIED TO HARD?
3.0	"Rayman Raving Rabbids was an OK game.

It offered a nice mini game selection, with variety. The plot was good, and you will laugh out loud like mad.

However, there are some flaws...

-The Difficulty can sometimes get out of hand
-The Game Crashes every now and then
-A bit short

I don't know if its worth playing. It's not a must, buts its certainly not a hate. It has flaws, but it's okay"
3.0	I was unimpressed. The Mario & Luigi handheld RPG series just doesn't stack up to the Paper Mario series or the original Legend of the Seven Stars. Not to label the game, franchise or the creators or anything, but this game in particular is better suited for younger children because of the level of difficulty, involvement and storyline this RPG supplies. Great game to break a younger sibling into the great RPG universe. The characters of this game are a riot though. Simply hilarious. Short, To-The-Point Reviews: Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga
3.0	ok Three Stars
3.0	The game works and i got it as a gift for somebody and they enjoy it as it brings them back good old memories, it was pretty used and the case was so-so, for its price and the fact it works, it got my 3, thanks again. Game works
3.0	"I want to get this out of the way: the gameplay in Watch_Dogs is totally beyond reproach. The gunplay feels visceral, dangerous, and just a little unwieldy (in a good, realistic way), stealth is simple and intuitive, and the hacking adds a level of puzzle gameplay over the normal GTA run-n-drive without being intrusive. How many games do you feel overwhelmed by, only to realize that, at the eleventh hour, there's a minigame that can save everything? Watch_Dogs manages that.

Further, its world feels alive and intuitive: say you locate a crime in progress and you want to stop it. You tail the criminal, wait for them to become dangerous, then beat them senseless. Panicked bystanders swarm around to take your photo and someone starts calling the cops, so you grab their phone then jump in a parked car and speed off. All this is achieved with elegant simplicity, as are apocalyptic car chases with crashing helicopters and exploding steam pipes everywhere.

Oh, and you can also take time out of your HEROIC VENGEANCE QUEST to play augmented reality games and go geocaching.

Virtual Chicago looks great too. The city's rivers and lakes shimmer and ripple with some of the realest water this side of Crysis, the buildings are sharp and detailed with hints of interior and abundant grit and wear, and NPCs are so varied that their random assembly seldom yields a crowd of clones. It does suffer a bit from GTA and Saints' Row's fantasy car syndrome- if Watch_Dogs is to be believed, everyone in uptown Chicago gets to work via Ducatis and Lotuses- but in a refreshing twist you can also pick up a beater trans-am in the sticks. The few rural areas look great as well, with rolling hills and deep, pine-festooned ravines.

""But Gosh, Moviedude!"" you say. ""You make this game sound outstanding, why in the world is it parked at so few stars?"" The answer of course is that the port to PC is absolutely bonkers. Performance is unreliable and spotty, and it's poor in ways that make no sense. Nightfall, for instance, can halve your frame rate when you're moving, yet hold still and pedestrians walk by at a buttery 60fps. Start driving and you can find your controls lagging badly, even though the game is running fine. And don't get me started on rain. Considering that Watch_Dogs was billed as a console game that wouldn't be dumbed down for PC, yet arrived literally STUPID on the PC, people are right to be mad.

THAT SAID! If you can get it working, it is outstanding fun. So here are the things I did to make it work. For reference I have a pretty modest rig- a Phenom IIx3, 8gb of DDR2, and a GTX690SC. So if you have a legit gaming PC, I'm sure you can get it working even better than me. The GeForce performance guide is where to start tweaking, but I will tell you that I am able to run almost everything full-tilt, provided I lower Level of Detail. This is the most killer setting in the game. Go ahead and turn your textures up, use any level of Ambient Occlusion, none of it mattered as much as this. And dialing it down doesn't even make much visible difference. Go figure. Other culprits include the pre-rendering of frames, which is to blame for most input lag. Some users report shaders hurting their frame rates, but on a newer card this shouldn't be an issue.

The question then is whether you should HAVE to root through two graphics options menus before guessing that lowering LoD- usually a setting that people with modern cards would want to, and have no problem with, turning up- would provide performance gains with negligible losses. And the answer is no, of course you shouldn't. We're playing Watch_Dogs because we aren't hackers in real life, Ubisoft. That's why even though this game is easily 5 stars for fun, it gets a three as a product. And I feel bad about it, but that's how it is. Great Game. Awful Port."
3.0	The product does not have as much content as It sounded as it did. Oh well can't win then all. Bit pricey for the content
3.0	"Based on the (apparently) popular Rabbids television program, Rabbids Invasion is an interactive Television show in a video game format.  I didn't actually notice this when we picked the game up, so when I opened it I was expecting something more along the lines of really excellent Rayman Raving Rabbids from the Wii, which was a really fun mini game extravaganza in the vein of Mario Party.

Rabbids Invasion is nothing like that.

It is, effectively an interactive cartoon that requires the Kinect feature of the X-Box One so you can play some mini games that follow along with the cartoon you're watching.  Unfortunately, the mini games in Rabbids Invasion simply weren't very fun to me.  They involve various hand motions, arm moving, and even screaming.  Yes, screaming.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.

With that being said, we had my nieces and nephew over to visit, and they absolutely loved it.  At the age range of 7-11, they had an absolute blast with the mini games and were laughing nearly the entire time.

Rabbids Invasion is definitely a game for kids.  While I wasn't a huge fan for myself, it's certainly a game that kids will enjoy that will keep them occupied for episodes at a time.  Just don't expect them to be quiet. Fun for Kids, Underwhelming for Adults."
3.0	"This game was very hyped....almost too much. Shooters have been the same for years, and battlefield one is awesome because it adds that realistic feel that franchises like ""CoD"" or ""Halo"" are missing. However, I still find it lacking. The Multiplayer is fun, with friends, alone you're not going to have as much fun, unless you enjoy destroying buildings with mortars all day. The vehicles are fun, but lose their luster really quickly. That's not to say I did not enjoy the the multiplayer, I did. Expect campers, as this is a real war game and many people will be in the brush line hiding or in a corner somewhere, which is fine in a game like this.

The single player has a compelling story and it's almost too realistic. Some army friends of mine said it triggered their PTSD a little. The visuals are great, and the attention to detail makes you feel like you're almost really there, as well as a game can. Would I recommend it? You can probably wait until next Black Friday to get it for 15$. OK, but not great."

3.0	"The tutorial is absolutely useless, after 3 minutes I restarted and jumped into one of the main campaigns.  If your a  seasoned pro like myself the learning curve should be no more than 15 minutes.  Are the graphics bad compared to other DS titles? absolutely. However GOOD GRAPHICS DONT MAKE A GOOD GAME.  Now onto the actual gameplay

It's a watered down turned based strat,  so you won't have to worry about setting tax rates, making citizens happy, or any crazy build orders.  You just build a farm, mine, lumberyard etc, you put your peasents there and you get resources.  You build stable, blacksmith, fletcher etc then you can train cav, infantry and archers.  From there you move your pixelated legionnaire  to an enemy city or army then the battle starts.

I was disappointed with the battles.  My first battle I arranged all my men nice and pretty and imagined that once the battle started I would have full control ( or atleast a little).  Once the battle starts your men advance, break formation and hack away in a giant melee. It won't make or break the game, but it would have been nice to have some RTS controls in the battle

Its a solid strat game for the DS. After the first hour, I had all of norther Italy under my control and was enjoying myself. good STRATEGY game"
3.0	This game should've been better.  The controls are sloppy and unrealistic.  The developers should have put more heart into it than they did. Not the best game in the world, but playable....
3.0	"It's a cute game.
I don't like the word cute.
It's over used. This game is fun and quite colorful. enjoy. I recommend you do some gardening this spring and summer though and play this game on the side. Pretty fun"

3.0	"I've got Combat Flight Simulator-1 (CFS1 - Europe) but bought this one too for the naval aviation aspect, and thought it cheaper to buy CFS2 than the pacific expansion disks released for the older game.  (Virtually all WWII sims of the past decade were set in Europe.  Despite a large number of titles, there hasn't been any PTO sims of note since ""1942: Pacific Air War"" and ""Pacific Strike"" of the mid 1990's.  Microprose followed PAW up with European Air War and the similarly set ""B-17""; EA/Janes followed ""World War 2 Fighters"" with ""Attack Squadron"" - both set over Europe; MS returned to Europe with CFS3, bypassing Korea which richly deserved attention)  In CFS2, you fly missions from Japanese or American island bases or carriers.
In many ways, CFS2 excels as an improvement over the older CFS1 (naval aviation aside), but is also a major disappointment for the exact same reason:  if you own the older game as I do, you'll probably spend more time trying to spot the improvements than just enjoying it.  Though the premise is different and sports a newer look between the missions (where the bleak look of CFS1 seems to have been inspired by episodes of ""World at War"", colorful comic-strip panels that seem inspired by nose-art ala Roy Lichtenstein dominates CFS2; if you saw the old Marvel Superheroes adventures of the 1960?s, you know what I mean), the game never capitalizes enough on its newer concept to break away from CFS1.  You're still in a pure fighter sim, using the same tactics and weapons as in CFS1.  Terrain is a huge improvement, but the graphics quality of the aircraft is not.  Smoking effects are an improvement (the kind you get when you mortally wound an enemy plane) but the sound/graphics related to enemy bullets is completely unconvincing (bullets sound as if they're whizzing past you, even while punching holes through your Hellcat).  The naval aviation aspects of CFS2 are also a mixed bag between ""wow"" and ""huh?!""  On the one hand, ships actually move (not like the perpetually parked steamers and U-Boats of CFS1) and even bob.  On the other hand, the sim doesn't let you fly the planes that flew anti-shipping strikes: dive bombers and torpedoe planes like the TBF or SBD, and none of your flyable planes are armed with torpedoes.  Though ships are an improvement over those in CFS1, that's not saying much.  While ships in CFS2 now burn, and even stop dead in the water before sinking, (rather than just disappear in a puff of polygon-fire) they otherwise slip quietly, and whole, beneath the Pacific - never breaking apart, listing or disgorging fuel or men like the game's planes (or those in ""Their Finest Hour"" of 1989).  Your own aircraft carrier remains curiously pristine (considering how they were magnets for enemy planes) but also devoid of any activity - human or mechanical - unlike the airfields of CFS1.  To help you land, there's an LSO (Landing Signal Officer), but he appears, not on the carrier, but in the ""radar"" window on your left side.  Looking much like the AOL stick-figure, I can't imagine this guy guiding anybody up the gangplank, let alone talking a landing airplane onto the wire.  (I've become proficient at carrier landings despite getting a ""WAVE-OFF!"" on every approach).  He doesn't even speak - the LSO has a pretty finite number of phrases (""wave-off"", ""power"", ""raise altitude"" or ""you're too high"" to think of a few).  A talking LSO was a fixture of ""F-14 Fleet Defender"" (1994).  Not that carrier-flying isn't a welcome challenge, it's just painfully obvious that nobody explored the cool ways to make the most of it.  Campaigns are pre-scripted, though dynamic campaigns would probably be wasted on a sim of this type.  That doesn't excuse an unnecessarily rigid mission requirement system that won't allow you to ""jump"" once you're out of ammo or damaged.  That itself was not as problematic as the alternative - I was willing to fly back to my carrier in real time, only to find that the in-flight map brought me back to where my carrier had been when I launched, not where it had gotten to about 2 hours later!
In short, CFS2 is more of a game-engine than completed game.  Likely, you can fill in the gaps described above with third-party software on the internet.  But it's an insult that CFS2 is so far short of its potential out of the box.  I bought the newer game because I expected more than an evolved form of CFS1 (I could've gotten that myself).  That's a shame, because the sim itself is such a beaut - one in which those interested enough can learn about the mechanics of WWII engines, face the challenge of carrier-landing battle-damaged planes or triumph over the supremely nimble Japanese planes using dive-and-zoom techniques (rather than trying to out-turn them as pilots will try by instinct).  It wasn't until I reached mid-1944 that I encountered clouds - but they were beautiful.  For its faults, CFS2 is that rare sim that keeps you coming back, and goes to lengths to keep you out of ""slew"" mode.
I ran CFS 2 on a P4-2Ghz, WinXP w/game port controls.  Graphics were acceptably fluid and there were no controllability problems, though load times are high.  If you haven't bought any WWII sims since the mid-90's, I'd suggest this one.  Otherwise, you'll have to weigh your interest in WWII naval aviation against the price of this one and your eagerness to have to customize a sim in ways you'd expect it to behave out of the box. An improvement over CFS1, but I expected more"
3.0	"The learning curve for this game is rather steep.  Learning how to serve the ball and get it in play is a challenge in itself.  This is a game that's probably best experienced on a home console.  It's not ideal for those random moments that you sometimes have to play a game.  You wouldn't want to take this game along on your briefcase so that you can play during your lunch break.  It demands more concentration and dedication than that.

As always, I try to keep my focus and my perspective in their proper places whenever I'm evaluating a video game.  Is the game of good quality, meaning the graphics, controls, mechanics, and game engine?  I would have to say yes and give this game 3 stars.  On the more subjective question of fun, I give this game a 2.  Again, this latter being more subjective than the former.  In my humble opinion, this game is not much fun on a portable console.

From my perspective, a portable game should be designed for a different use than a home console game.  A PSP game should lean more towards casual gaming, with a not-too-steep learning curve.  This is one of those games that would be more enjoyable on the PS2. Steep Learning Curve"
3.0	good Three Stars
3.0	"After being blown away by Far Cry and having spent heaps of time playing Rainbow 6 I guess I was expecting more from this. The original Half-Life was spectacular in its time. Sadly Half-Life 2 was a dissappointment. It's good don't get me wrong and while it rises over the mediocre it doesn't go much further than that. I was so antcipating this game that I forked out the extra bucks for the Collectors edition. Forgiving the fact that it took 3 days to figure out how to install it, the game is just uninspired. It is massively linear, massively easy, and massively predictable, basically it's boring. As for the story, I am not sure what happened, it just lost it's magic from the first one. The little elements with the soldiers conversations, the intriguing level design, the weapons, the variety of story telling methods, it is all gone in part 2. They still haven't got endings right. This is better than the jumping levels of the first one but its not great.

From a technical standpoint, it is a masterpiece. The physics, graphics and sound are all extremely well done. However the level design, the story telling and the weapons are just mediocre. The level design is extremely linear and becomes very predictable after awhile. A lot of the level design is clearly done to show off the impressive physics engine that sits underneath the levels. This is used to good effect later in the piece when you pick up the gravity gun. With the gravity gun you can manipulate objects to great effect including killing enemies with objects. However once you get the gravity gun you are basically invincible and once I got it I never died again in the game (on the hardest difficulty) except once when I accidently fell off a ledge. The weapons are not balanced at all in this game. The pistol is effective to 800 yards. Once i was shooting this guy who was maybe 12 pixels tall with the pistol because he was so far away and he wasn't dying though I had shot him with 3 full magazines. When i got closer I realised he wouldn't die because he was required to deliver a scripted speech so that I knew what to do next. Anyways, I moved on, killing folk at 800 yards with my pistol. Maybe they'll eventually fix this with a patch but it doesn't say much for the physics engine.

The things that were fun in the original most notable it's great story that was revealed as you went along are missing here. It has little replay value so play it once and then uninstall. I'll get extra value out of the T-shirt. To remove the bitter taste from my mouth I think I'll go and play FarCry.

On Reflection: The above review was done a month after the games release when I was working in the gaming industry. I remember it clearly, it was hyped beyond all belief, the magazine raved about it, everyone thought it was wonderful. About 50 of us at work bought it all in the space of 2 days. A week later none of us talked about it anymore, it just simply wasn't that good. A year on and it is long forgotten. The replay value is in the T-Shirt."
3.0	"Beyond Two Souls is the latest work of Quantic Dream, who make the curious decision to place story, environments, and characters beyond gameplay upgrades. You play a duo of a little girl and her pet poltergeist soul-bound hanger on as you work through her life of being experimented on and the happy trails that follow. Or maybe you're trained by the CIA for ""perfectly normal"" work.

Gameplay is awesome with Aiden, the poltergeist. You don't have much beyond scouting and knocking things over, but you'll be surprised how absorbing that can be, and how difficult it is to keep in mind when you're fleeing police or are wracking your brain about a piece of info you need. What makes it awesome is there is real choice. You can even be a brat in the tutorial level and the game will just move on rather than go ""you must prove that you're paying attention."" Combat is a bit frustrating even though its simple. You tap in a particular direction or manipulate the controller itself. Whats annoying is you are supposed to gage which motion is being made while its happening. Is that straight kick to the groin a right motion, or technically up? And when you make a wrong choice, it doesn't give much in the way of notice what should have been correct. Balancing this is at least you have to slipup several times to really be punished.

Voices and environments are wonderful if a tad narrow in scope. Some stages flee like a set of canal locks, but while you're drifting along the current stretch, its awesome to stop and smell the roses. Characters have full side conversations and don't stop to bask in you PC glow when you get close enough to hear what they're talking about.

Nits are few and far between with one exception. While the super simple interface is nice, its so simple that its sometime a trial to find the white dot that you actually can interact with on that white door. You have to be standing in the right spot and push in the right direction, though this doesn't happen nearly as often during crucial moments, just during exploration. Other than that limited and still workable flaw, this is a highly polished, basically flawless diamond.

Update: I tend not to play the entire story start to finish before writing a review, but the ending for this was so hollow it lost two stars just for it. Its not as bad as ME3, but the final run up is remeniscent of Quantic Dreams massive story failure with Indigo Prophecy. The end doesn't tie in with the rest of the story well, the premise is really destroyed by trying to explain it, which just opens up massive amounts of plot holes. The main villian shows up in a total of 3 scenes, and you don't even realize he was supposed to be the villian until moments before he dies, and on and on. Its obvious that they intended to include 10-20 hours more story, because there's just so, so much that's not explained, but its slapped in your face to the point that it still demands an explanation. Trying not to provide spoilers, but when you finally learn how Jodie got her powers you're just like ""What?.... That happens all the time!"" QD had a massive hit with Heavy Rain, but nearly snatched defeat from the jaws of certain victory with this. Superb story and awesome gameplay, but falls apart"
3.0	"I would have liked to have given this game five stars, but the driving isn't very good. Which is kind of a big deal in a racing game. I find my car drifting where it shouldn't, turning when I don't, etc. It's just not a very realistic driving game. The driving reminds me of those old piece of crap video games we used to play in the 80s.

But, why give it three stars? Because the few times I DO play it, it's okay. It's not the worst game I've played. But, it's not really worth the money I paid for it, either.  I've never finished it and won't ever finish it because the driving is so bad that it's impossible to beat certain missions. Which is too bad. I really love the old Need for Speed franchise.

I don't know who bought the franchise, but they should be fired. It's a sad testament when a game actually gets worse with each incarnation. Especially when technology just keeps improving. Oh well. If you buy Rivals, you won't be disappointed in the graphics. But, you'll probably hate the game play. Graphics: 5 Stars  Gameplay: 1 Star  Total Score: 3 Stars"
3.0	The rock candy wii remote is a pretty good alternative to the standard Wii remote. They made the +, -, HOME, and power buttons easier to use and placed them better. They raised the d pad up and made it feel much more comfortable. The 1 and 2 buttons are okay, as of most modded contollers do it so it's pretty standard. The motion controls felt a little off, but that may be because I haven't played that game in forever and are a little rusty. It looks amazing in person. The only other problem is that the LED lights that blink when trying to connect to the system are really bright. Overall I would buy this item at around $15 dollars. $20 if you need it. (Please note this is not a nintendo product and is 3rd party.)Also, I would have given this 3.5 starts but you can't have half stars.( I have not used it much so I don't know about it wearing out or breaking.) Feels good and looks Amazing
3.0	Bought this controller thinking that it was for an X-box 360, not an original X-box. Once I found someone who could use it, I heard nothing but positive feedback. In the future, please make sure the controllers are in their proper catagories. Thank you. Right controller, wrong advertising.
3.0	This game was played quickly.  Good game when you have company and need to share and take turns using a game. Gift for grandsons

3.0	The game is not fun.  The amiibo however (which you would think looks very plain for just being a metal plug) is actually quite nice.  The detail in the paint and cord especially make this amiibo very cool.  If I would have known amazon was going to sell the amiibo separately later on, I would have waited and not bought the game but I guess that was nintendo's plan all along huh? Get the amiibo not the game.
3.0	It's a Christmas gift so I didn't try it (probably will try it).  Super fast delivery and as described!!!!  OK tried it, it works.  Game sticks in and is hard to remove. Super fast delivery and as described
3.0	"The title of the review is exactly what to expect with this release. The plot of the game revolves around some experimental drug called ""WhiteKnight"" that was tested on soldiers during Vietnam. Needless to say it doesn't workout so well and it basically transforms the soldiers to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;style infected. You assume the role of a newly arrived soldier trying to find your brother who was involved in the experiments.

Graphics are actually quite decent. Something that I found strange was at times the graphics appear to be seamless then at other times it looks as if its a cleaned-up, steroid-injected&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/XIII/dp/B00008Z0HX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">XIII</a>&nbsp;(and I mean that in a good way). Controls/Player movement are okay, unfortunately there is no ""cover"" method and that hurts the gameplay significantly. While you still can kneel behind objects you can still get shot. Also the hit-detection seems a bit off at times. Many times you can shoot directly at someone and hit some sort of invisible barrier around objects.

Gameplay is an excellent blend of a Vietnam-style FPS and a horror-survival game (i.e.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doom-3/dp/B00006C2HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doom 3</a>).

Some parts of the game will have you navigating booby-trapped areas and fighting the Vietcong in the jungle shooting at you from all directions (and I do mean all directions) and other parts of the game you'll be fighting off infected in close-quarters combat (inside dark houses, tunnels, etc.) which is actually quite creepy (many times I found myself jumping and swearing at the same time).

This is probably strictly a like-it or hate-it release yet I find myself in the middle ground. While I love FPS's, I'm not the biggest fan of Survival-Horror games which sways my judgement a bit. But if your a fan of both, I don't see how you wouldn't highly enjoy this title. Full Metal Jacket meets 28 Days Later"
3.0	I Love the Guitar Hero Series. This one is fun, don't like all the songs. But I still like it. The only problem I have with this game (and I have bought others from different places) but while playing the yellow note will showup and then you can't play that note which makes it to where you really can't get a good score. Sometimes it will make it to were you can't even play any of the other notes. But on this game, seems to only show up for a short time; which allows continue play. I am Happy with it; because I can at least play it!! Pretty Good

3.0	"Ever since Mario Party debuted on the Nintendo 64, we've been receiving a new game in the series on a yearly basis.  The last few Mario Party games have all been tiring.  Almost rehashes.  However, with the Wii, Mario Party has a chance to be a lot of fun again thanks to the Wii-Remote.  Unfortunately, it isn't all its cracked up to be.  The Wii-Remote controls work, but they feel like a last minute tack on, and ultimately some of the mini-games just aren't all that fun.  Finally, there are other video games chock full of mini-games that make much better use of the Wii-Remote than Mario Party 8.

The formula for Mario Party really hasn't changed at all over the years.  You and your friends (or the computer) will roll the die, move around the board at the end of each round of rolls you'll be thrown into a mini-game.

The mini-games are pretty short.  Most of them being around 30 seconds long.  Some of them are quite fun and make good use of the wii remote, such as the game where you have to shake up a soda can, or wipe off the chomp.  However, there are not a lot of these kinds of mini-games.  Most other mini-games don't make as big of an impression with the wii-remote, as most of them consist of you holding the wii remote like a basic gamepad and then tilting it left or right.  Take for example, the game where you race on water skis.  You don't actually do anything outside of tilting the wii remote left and right to jump ramps.  It is in moments like these where the wii remote controls just feel tacked on.  And unfortunately, this comes up in quite a few mini games.  There are also a lot of mini games that simply have you tilting the Wii-Remote forward and backward.  Again, the controls feel tacked on in instances like this.

The biggest slap in the face, however, is that there are a myriad of mini-games that don't use the wii-remotes motion sensor controls at all and you'll hold it like a gamepad, and play with it like it's a gamepad using the D-Pad to move your character and all.  It's also to no credit that these games aren't really all that fun.

To the game's credit, though, when they do make good use of the wii-remote and its motion sensor controls, they really do a bang up job.  Such as the mini-game where everyone shoots at the screen while one person dodges.  It's just unfortunate that there aren't a lot of mini-games that do so, and instead make you either play the traditional way or just simply tilt the wii remote.  There are some fun games here, but the game is populated by more games that really aren't a lot of fun.

As usual, Mario Party games are no fun by yourself.  They need to be played with friends and family.  Like previous installments, multi-player can be a lot of fun--provided you get a good mini-game.  Some of the games are free-for-all but there are also some games where you'll be by yourself against three players, or working together with one other player.  Mostly, though, they're free for alls, and playing with a friend is nice just so that you can see who's better.  Multi-player has always been a strong aspect of Mario Party and it's no different in number 8.  However, much like previous installments, the game is entirely left up to chance.  One moment you're in first place, and after the very next roll you're in last.  It's annoying sometimes because you really don't have any control.  It's all a game based on luck.  This is both a good and bad thing. Good because it makes the outcome unpredictable, and once more anyone can play this without any prior experience.  It's bad, however, because for some who like to add a little strategy to their gaming, you just can't do it here.

Perhaps the biggest problem facing Mario Party 8 is that it doesn't really present a whole lot of new stuff that wasn't in Mario Party 7.  With the game making use of the Wii-Remote, one would expect the experience to be quite different.  Instead it's more of the same thing.  Especially because there are other games on the Wii that are filled with mini-games that make far better use of the remote (Rayman Raving Rabbids comes to mind).  In Mario Party 8 the wii remote controls either feel tacked on or you don't really use them.  It's also hard to get past the fact that the mini-games aren't very inventive because of this.  Certainly water-skiing is fun, but when you're just tilting left and right throughout the whole thing?  You might as well have just put this on the Gamecube and let me tilt the analog stick left and right.

Graphically, it's no surprise that Mario Party 8 isn't the best looking game out there.  Mario Party games usually aren't.  At least it runs smoothly.  There's no slow down or frame rate issues.  It really doesn't look any different than any of the Mario Party games on the Gamecube however, and those who have a widescreen television will be disappointed to know that the game won't take up the whole screen, and instead will give you a boarder.  Luckily, graphics don't make the game.  Mario Party doesn't look bad, it just looks dated.

Mario Party 8 had so much potential.  If they'd done more intuitive things with the Wii Remote, this may have been worth a buy.  There are other mini-game collections out there that utilize the wii remote much better than this.  There will be plenty of gamers out there that will be able to get past the big flaws and just have fun with it, but if you're one who's been playing Mario Party since the beginning, you can't help but admit a change is in order.  Unfortunately Mario Party 8 doesn't do much for you.

Pros:

+When the Wii Controls are good, the games are actually quite fun
+Simplistic gameplay; anyone could pick this up and play it with no problems
+There are over 60 mini-games to play

Cons:

-There are far too many mini-games where the wii controls feel tacked on, and these games are pretty boring to play
-There are far too many mini-games that don't make use of the motion sensor controls at all
-There are not a lot of very inventive mini-games
-In short, the game doesn't do much to stand out above previous Mario Party installments.  You'd think with the Wii Remote, Mario Party 8 would be something new to experience, but instead it ends up not being that much of a step higher than Mario Party 7 A Mediocre Party"
3.0	"This is a fun game and I honestly play it too much! It's pretty much your whacky cartoon version of battlefield. There are four types to choose from on each side: Plants have sunflower, chomper, pea-shooter, cactus. Zombies have engineer, all-star (football zombie), scientist, foot soldier.

You can upgrade each class's appearance and weapons. To get unlockables you earn coins each session and use them to buy sticker packs that contain helpful goodies and unlockable items. You can also unlock sticker packs by completing set tasks to build a particular characters rank meter.

Even though this game can be fun it has some frustration about it. Co-op split screen/Boss mode are next-gen only. The game also has some random technical issues particularly with loading and servers. Respawns can be awful and in some cases leaving you stuck in awkward situations. There are times when abilities don't perform as they should. This game without question needs a patch to make things run smoother.

For those wondering there isn't a campaign just multiplayer action with/against other people online for a common goal and there are a handful of interesting modes to play. PS3 in my opinion is the best destination playing-wise to have at this game, no need for playstation+ or xboxlive memberships (unlike PS4, XBOX ONE, & XBOX 360). To sum it all up this is worth buying or renting. Win Some, Lose Some"
3.0	Campaign is very short, but I never played the Multiplayer modes. Good game though in terms of graphics, gameplay and somewhat voice acting. Also from the look of the covers, the masks remind me of the Neo Vipers from G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009). You know, the G.I. Joe movie a lot of those hated so much and still. Average Shooter, But Short.
3.0	"Neverwinter Nights (NWN) is another creation by Bioware which is the same company that brought life back to the Dungeons and Dragons series, mainly through one of the all-time RPG series, Baldur's Gate.  NWN is the first test for Bioware's new playing engine which promises to deliver Dungeons and Dragons with better graphics and smoother online play.  The game begins with four options: One, you can play the included campaign by yourself; Two, you can join online and play the campaign with other gamers; Three; you can create an online server and host a game as the Dungeon Master (if you have a very fast connection and computer); Four, you can use the tool set which allows you to create any kind of campaign you can think of.
My first warning about this game is that if you don't have a high-speed modem and a group of online friends to play with on a regular basis, the multiplayer experience in NWN will not be much fun.  NWN is a revolutionary game in that it makes an honest attempt to simulate the pen and paper Dungeons & Dragons product by allowing someone to host the game as a Dungeon Master and control the adventure.  The Dungeon Master can change the creatures the players are facing, create dialogue and alter other plot aspects to make the game more fun for online players.  All pen and paper role-playing games rely on one player to control the game and this is probably the best attempt at having a Dungeon Master control a PC RPG game.
Unfortunately, I haven't had much fun with it.  The experiences one obtains from sitting at a table and watching a Dungeon Master articulate the adventure, roll the dice and act out a story are not present with a PC game.  Most of the servers are password protected so the best way to enjoy NWN online is to already have a close group of friends that you can hook up with on a regular basis.  The online experience even tries to simulate player vs. player scenarios and Bioware has already released an additional ""Tournament of Champions"" module that allows people to fight against each other.  If your main intention is to player kill, you'll have more fun in an MMORPG.  Also note that many servers only allow people to control server-based characters which means that you can only play characters stored on the server's hard drive and will have to join that same server to play the character again.
ACTION FANS  - 2 STARS - This is not a game for people that want action first.  Some ""RPGs"" such as Diablo and Dungeon Siege are more hack and slash driven and draw in more action gamers than an RPG normally would.  This game is not in the mold of Diablo so if you are expecting those types of fast-paced-cut-down-everything-in-sight-no-reading-required-dungeon-crawlers you probably won't enjoy NWN.
STRATEGY FANS  - 2 STARS - The campaign included has some puzzle solving but nothing that can't be figured out quickly.  Probably one of the biggest appeals for strategy fans in previous Bioware games was taken out: the ability to micromanage your adventuring party.  In past Bioware D&D games, you could pause the game and pick individual commands for other party members in battle which made the games more fun and added a strategic angle to the game but sadly this option has been taken out of NWN.  While you can still pause and change the commands of your character, you can not do this with your henchmen anymore and even worse, the game only allows you to hire one henchman instead of the five members that tagged along in previous Bioware D&D games.
ADVENTURE/RPG FANS - 5 STARS - This it the game that the pen and paper D&D crowd has been waiting for.  Unfortunately, the only way to enjoy that experience is with a great group of online buddies and fast connection.  For those that purchase NWN to enjoy the great single-player experience that brought in so many fans to games such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, you may be disappointed.  Bioware promised to pay as much attention to the singleplayer mode as it was to the multiplayer aspect but it looks like the singleplayer mode was neglected.  Hopefully, Bioware will add some changes that the singleplayer fans are asking for.
X FACTOR - NEW BIOWARE ENGINE - 3 STARS - While the new playing engine definitely improves the graphics and adds several user-friendly options like more control over the journal and maps, it seems like some of the previous perks of the old D&D engine were changed for the worse.  One example would be the new camera angle which doesn't go below 45 degrees making it almost impossible for you to see ahead in a dungeon without drawing back the camera until your character is a little spot on your monitor.
BUGS  - 5 STARS - Very few bugs which Bioware is known for.  While some have complained of bugs and crashes, I myself have only had one in-game freeze and I have played it for several days and too many hours to mention. There is also a very friendly updater in the game that allows you to easily patch it with any fixes that have been released.
REPLAY VALUE - 5 STARS - While I haven't enjoyed the campaign included in the game as much as previous Bioware D&D stories I feel the redeeming factor is that an easy tool set has been included in the game that allows anyone to design a campaign of their own.  Already, some small campaigns have been released at various fan websites.  Comparing the editor to other games, it is very easy to use and Bioware has just released a great online tutorial for it.  Considering the vast imagination in a fan community that plays D&D, I'm sure there will be several great mods released in the future that promise to bring hours of enjoyment. Great RPG but something is missing"
3.0	"This game is very typical Tony Hawk, which in a word is fun.  Not the EXTREME type of fun typical with this genre, but the more laid back, remember when I was in high school spending time at my buddy's house partaking in some ""activities"" and playing this game.  If getting huge combos and annoying local residents while getting lifted is your thing, this is your game. Typical"
3.0	"On Xbox Live (or probably over a network), this game is great.  Lots of multiplayer action.  And I like the fact that there are bots even in multiplayer (so when I'm outclassed I can run and hope the bots distract my opponents).
But on a single Xbox machine it is useless.  I was hoping that it would be close to as fun as 1 player Halo, or cooperative-mode Halo, or Halo deathmatch (on a single Xbox).  Problem is, you can't play deathmatch or cooperative play on a single Xbox!  So all you're left with is fighting a bunch of bots.
If you have Xbox Live and you like deathmatch type games, then you'll probably enjoy this.
If you don't have Xbox Live, save your money for Doom 3 or Halo 2 (if you don't have Halo, go buy it NOW). Only for Xbox Live"
3.0	This is an excellent James Bond game for multiplayer mode. Unlike what other people said, the maps in multiplayer are not that tiny and they can feature AI bots if you turn them on. But this game SUCKS for single player. The graphics are extremely bad and the guns suck. You can't even tell who is supposed to be James Bond!!!! It looks like Pierce Brosnan but it sounds like Roger Moore or something. The plot is also very weak. Another bad thing is that this game says it has the golden gun and all it is is just a pistol painted gold! The game is in 2nd person shooter which also SUCKS. I only recommend this game if you intend it for multiplayer use with 2+ friends. The last bad thing is that after your enemys die they just dissapear which is stupid. But it is what it is. Good Multiplayer Game
3.0	"BF2 (the main game), is a decent game. It has really high system requirements and even if you meet them you should surpass what EA says you need and still you might have to turn down the graphics. Overall, the playability factor is good. I was hoping it would be A LOT better than the great game Desert Combat, but it might be only so-so better. This expansion pack is buggy and I have some crash issues (already had some, so really more), and it has some new guns that are good, but not great. It also has some vehicals that are just whatever and the maps are only so-so too. Playing the night maps is frusterating and I want to shoot and move, not bumble around in the dark. Overall. you can avoid this and still play on the normal BF2 servers, and I do not think the new guns are good enough to put you at that much of a disadvantage, almost no disadvantage.

Lastly, I am waiting still, for some company to come out with a game that is great as what so many of us are imagining in our heads as far as MODERN military combat and vehicals (what is with the WW2 overkill with games). Anyway, if you really like BF2, buy this. If you think BF2 is pretty good, but don't play a lot, avoid this, if you don't know what ""First Person Shooter"" means, this isn't for you.

Take Care, Sam BF2 is good, this adds a little, but not much and many have problems"

3.0	"This was my last PC game. I am not a fan of the ancient keybord/mouse input and much prefer a controler, unfortunatley this game like many others does not support Xbox/windows controler properly.

I purchased it for Xbox360 and it's fantastic.

Until the developers include proper controler support for PC games I will not purchase any more. (please not that some strategy games and others play very well without controler support, Action and racing games for must have it). Great game on XBOX360- no controler support on PC"

Oh yeah, and the exotic locations are just breathtaking, especially Santorini. Before I purchased this game, I read the professionals review which gave this game a 4 out of 10 rating, but focused mainly on the training mode which I admit is flawed. I'd love to add some video footage of the game to convince people that this game deserves a better rating (especially with Santorini and my girl Cindy), but unfortunately I don't own the rights to put up a video of this beautiful game play footage. For the current price of an Andrew Jackson and free Prime shipping it's a worthy purchase.

3.0	Ok this game will feel and look dated by today's standard, but if you can look past that and get into the mood this game sets, you will be in for a treat of some really scary moments.  This has a part that made my blood turn cold.  The game turns into someone what of a shooter towards the end but it picks up again with it's melee style combat in the last chapter i think.  The story is interesting. I has some parts that play like FEAR.  For the price and the enjoyment I got of this, as a horror fan, I loved this game. It made me go back and get the first game. Some parts scared the crap outta me
3.0	"I realize that Nintendo excels in many video game genres. For example, Mario will probably always be the king of platform games. Mario Party will always be the must-have party game. No one has even tried to top Super Smash Bros. But Mario Kart is an exception. Sure, Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo was fun when it was the only cart racing game out there and it was a new concept. But Nintendo has done almost nothing since to improve upon its own idea.
In Mario Kart Super Circuit, you will see essentially the same courses, same weapons and the same characters that you have seen in every other Mario Kart game. The courses are actually pretty short and boring. You spend a day or two playing through all the circuits to unlock nothing and after that there really is no incentive to ever play it again. If you can find some friends who have GBA's then you can have up to a four-player race. But in order to play the battle mode, which is probably the best part of the game, your friends all need to have not only the GBA but the game cartridge as well.
Overall, this is a pretty sloppy effort by Nintendo. I like Mario, and I cannot seem to resist buying every one of his games, but I always want to kick myself for buying the Mario Kart games. Been there, done that"

3.0	"These 2 games are excellent of themselves. So I was very excited to hear of a remaster. Well, don't expect much, if any bump in visuals or ANY bonus content. With such a good track record of this developer I really expected more. Like bioshock, excellent graphical and frame rate boost, and some pretty neat bonus content. Nothing doing here. Same graphics with slight lighting improvements, squint to see it, same frame rate, moments of chugging, and you have one very poor ""remaster"". I really regret buying this, am pretty salty at the developer for this, and really can't recommend buying it unless you have not already played this games on last gen consoles. Great games, subpar remaster"
3.0	If you have a balance board and don't want to risk slipping, this is a must have (I don't even have to take off my socks with this). It helps prevent the board from getting dirty as well as prevents slipping (falling during rhythm step is your own fault). The cover is easy to wipe off with a damp cloth, though I recommend getting a different color (like black) if you have pets or girls with long hair because the hair will stick to the silicone and looks, well, ugly... Check for sales of silicone sleeves, you can get them as low as four bucks so if you want to just toss them out when they get too dirty, it's not a big deal. Overall, I highly recommend getting a sleeve to protect your balance board investment and prevent slipping. A must have....though I recommend a different color
3.0	I like it but one of the fans started making a squealing noise in the second week. Maybe I just got a bad one.
3.0	"I had high hopes for Warhammer. The ideas in it are very good, and this game could have been a killer.  After playing it for a year, having left once and come back, I am reluctantly leaving it again.  The problem that Warhammer has been unable to resolve is player number imbalances on the servers.  I've played on two servers and they both have the same problem, way more players playing the Destruction ""bad guys"" than playing for Order.  Although I don't know the actual numbers, the Order players are so outnumbered that they have practically no chance of winning in the core ""open RvR"", PvP fighting.  Two nights this week I was unable to find any open RvR action because all the Order player had simply left. Most of the time, Order will try to get a warband going for PvP, and will immediately be run over by Destruction warbands with twice as many players.  I believe the problem is self perpetuating because new players and existing Order players will start Destruction characters to be on the winning side, making the imbalances worse.  I've played a Destruction character also, and it got boring fast also when there is no opposition.  If the trend continues, and it does appear to be getting worse, soon all the players will be on one side only.  Good PvP combat should depend on teamwork and skill, not just having more fighters than the other side.
  This is a serious flaw in what could have been a very good game.  As it is, there is little enjoyment and a lot of frustration. After a year of playing, serious problems"
3.0	"This controller took some getting used to, but I am starting to like it. It is not as nice feeling in the hand as the official street fighter controllers, but it is a good replacement, as they are no longer being manufactured and are getting harder, and more expensive, to find. Things I liked: nice long cord, flat buttons, adjustable directional pad (first time I've seen one of those!). Things I didn't like: turbo seems kind of jinky, and has spontaneously reverted to regular speed in the middle of a match. Controller has a ""cheap plastic feel"". Not as bad as some controllers I have owned, but definitely not as premium as I would have thought, considering the price of it. I am really bad about nitpicking an item and returning it if I find one thing wrong, but for me, this controller's pros outweigh the cons enough that I have decided to keep it. For me, that's saying a lot. I am super picky.

UPDATED 04/15... Well, after about six months of use, this controller died on me. It began to malfunction about a week ago and has continued to degrade until it is unusable. It was the directional pad that went. The left and right directionals went out. I was very surprised as I do not use this controller very roughly. Just a few hours a week. Guess I'll have to buy another one. So I deducted one star for longevity. I think a year's worth of use if a bit more reasonable. Seems like six months is kind of short for a controller to go out. Nice feel but not very sturdy. Only lasted six months of light usage."
3.0	Sniper Elite III is Extremely Short- I finished it at a pretty slow pace in only about 6.5 hours. I don't know where people are coming up with 12 hours. Maybe if you crawl the whole way through. The gameplay is pretty cool. Sniping, xray slow-mo shots, & stealth are all good. Graphics are good, but not truly next gen. Maybe it suffers as it's another WWII game in that respect. There are a few glitchy movements by the player & the AI, but it's not too bad. It really doesn't offer much of anything new except the xray shots. This is another very short & somewhat disappointing next gen game. Hoping 2015 is a better year for gaming! Luckily I rented this game. I wouldn't pay more than $30.00 for it as it's so short.

3.0	"You play a cop called Nick Kang who solves street crimes such as arresting rapist and kidnapist. The first thing you'll notice in the first 5 mins of the game are the decent cutcenes but they're nothing original.
Music
you get rap in this and there is Warren G, Snoop dog, Lil Eazy, E40 and Bone thugs n harmony and a lot more. There's is like 15 disks of music or more. I like Snoop dogs music but there was only dance with me and I didn't like it. If you haven't listeed to Bone thugs THUGGISH RUGGISH BONE you're in for a treat.
DRIVING
This is an okay game, I prefer it to the Getaway because the driving bits are faster and doesn't slow down because you can go through barriers and trees unlike the getaway. As driving you get random street crimes and they are repetetive, it's just the guy on your radio says different stuff like ""this truck has activition video games stop it"" or ""stop kidnapper"".
There is a good cop bad cop rating. If you run over innocents it goes down. You can kill bad guys if they've got guns and your rating won't go down.
You can shoot out of your car window or you can hold down the right trigger and it'll go into slowmo and you can shoot enemies legs to not kill them. You can get an upgrade on your car and you can hit the side tail of a car(whilst doing a 180)and cause it to spin out of control.
You can get boosts and burnouts was well but they aren't helpful. The helpful ones are drive on 2 wheels to dodge bullets and to do a 360 spin to take out the guy in the car quickly when he leasts exspects it.
FIGHTING.
Fighting beats GTA by miles. A is low kick, B is throw, X is punch and Y is high kick. Keep beating up someone and when he goes groggy it goes in slow mo. Then you finish him of with a move like monkey kick by pushing Y X. There are like 18 moves or more. The animation is cool, when doing a drop kick you fall to the ground then do a cool spin up on the ground. When enemies are on floor you can elbow drop them and more.
SHOOTING.
Shooting is great by doing side way dives to avoid getting shot. You can hold different weapons in each hand like machine guns.
STEALTH.
Stealth in this is crap. You just run through and push 1 button. You use deadly attack or stun. Stun is a karate chop and deadly is snapping thier neck, remember that E3 trailer in May/March 2003(I think) were it played the Above the law song and it showed Nick snapping that guys arm, it's a shame that you can't do that. You also get broken glass and more on the floor to dodge from not being herd.

3.0	Not a fan Naw
3.0	"This wasn't that bad of a game, but it certainly wasn't anywhere near good either. I liked the nostalgia, finding weapons and items of characters from previous Alien films. About half way through the game It felt like the story was just dragging along, but picks up at the middle/end a bit but not enough for me to enjoy it thoroughly. The game felt like Call of Duty x Aliens and I might as well have been shooting squirrels because they come at you in waves and die in seconds; leaving any ""horror"" the game may have been trying to attempt in the gutter.

There are still a few bugs and glitches in the game but not as many as when it was first released, it's much more playable now. But there are still two or three that I found that were rather annoying and ruin the immersion at some points.

The end of the game left me with many unanswered questions (that will never be answered) so it just left a bad taste in my mouth. I only recommend this if you are a hardcore Alien fan, but even then, I still recommend you pay no more then $5 for this. Aliens: CM for a $1"

Despite this, the characters are awesome...what could be better than fighting with Godzilla and all his...erm, ""buddies.""  However, unlocking new characters is extremely hard.  This also has to be one of the most frustrating games I have ever seen.  At some points the monsters you are facing are so much stronger to the point that it is truly impossible to fight back.

TB includes no less than six different cables and adapters for various hookups... except the one I needed for my original Xbox 360.  If you have an Xbox 360 slim or E model with a digital (SPDIF) output, then you'll probably be in good shape.  But if you have an older model with the hard drive mounted externally (no SPDIF), then you'll need something called an Xbox 360 Audio Adapter (sold separately), like this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turtle-Beach-Ear-Force-Audio-Adapter-Cable-for-Xbox-360/dp/B00B08REVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turtle Beach Ear Force Audio Adapter Cable for Xbox 360</a>

I downloaded the .pdf manual hoping for more detailed information, but it too fails to impart anything useful to the customer regarding setup or the headset's functions.

For example, please tell me what the multitude of buttons on the headset actually do, rather than just repeat a list of the labels that are printed on the earcups.  Same goes for the included cables and adapters.  There is more information printed on the plastic bag they ship in than what is written in the included setup guide or the downloaded manual.  My headset light is flashing blue--what does that mean?  I don't know, because neither the included setup guide nor the downloaded manual mentions it.

Failing my Xbox 360 hookup attempt, I turned to the Turtle Beach website and discovered that the Phantom is (allegedly) compatible with the Xbox One, which does have a SPDIF out.  So this hookup seemed a lot more straightforward--XB SPDIF out to SPDIF in on the transmitter, and XB USB out to DC in on the transmitter.  After charging the headset via its USB charge cable (which incidentally, turns the headset 'on' whenever it's connected, so you can't turn the headset 'off' while it's charging), I had no sound at all.  I figured that was my fault, but by now the included user guide and the downloaded .pdf were in the trash.

Through trial and error, I discovered a little slide wheel on the underside of the headset that's labeled ""Game Sound.""  This is separate from the ""Volume"" control buttons, but turning this up enabled me to hear sound through the headset!  Joy!  Again, the manual could have mentioned this little nugget of information and saved me time and a headache by informing me that there's a difference between ""Game Sound"" control and ""Volume"" control.  Who knew?

Unfortunately, my joy was short lived.  While TB claims the Phantom to be compatible with the Xbox One, if you want to do more than just listen (ie: chat) then you'll need your Kinect to handle the outgoing audio part.  That's right, you can't use the headset's microphone to chat on an Xbox One.  Yet.  At the time of this review, there is talk/debate about an adapter that allegedly in the works for 2014 which will enable you to use the headset microphone for chat.  Until then, you're stuck with the Kinect for the chat part, which means the people you're playing with will hear what's going on in the entire room in addition to what you're saying.

But for solo gameplay or watching movies, this wireless headset is absolutely the best.  The Phantom headset is very well made--you can feel the quality the first time you lift if from the box--and extremely comfortable to wear for long periods.  In fact, this is probably the most comfortable headset I have ever used.  They sound great too, and with the positional Surround Sound, you can micro-adjust it to suit your own tastes.  I'd like to know what all the other buttons do too, but... you know, that ""no help"" manual thing again. The on-board voice prompts from ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" is pretty cool.  It says things like ""Powering Off"" or ""Game Mode One"" (whatever that is).  There's configuration software you can download, and then connect the headset to your computer and customize these too.

If there was one thing I would say could be improved about the Phantom headset then it would definitely be to include a better written user guide--like one that actually covers the headset's many cool features, multiple hookups, and the basics of how to use it.  In hindsight, this all seems simple enough, but if you're not a techie, then you might find the available documentation about as helpful as if it were written in Latin.  Until such time TB produces said detailed, helpful user guide, you're pretty much stuck with trial and error and figuring things out for yourself.

UPDATE: Jan 20, 2014.  I have a negative to add to my review, and I am deducting a star for it. Like most people, I am limited to where I can position the transmitter from my Xbox because of the length of the SPDIF cable.  My Xbox also sits within close range of my wireless router (about 6 feet from the headset transmitter).  Whenever I try to charge or use the headset (ie when the transmitter is ON), I completely loose my internet connection because the transmitter overpowers my router signal. Thus, I can only use/charge the headset OR be online.  I can't do both simultaneous.  Pretty useless if you're trying to play while actually using the headset.  You might say, ""move your router"" or ""use Ethernet not wireless"" which would be the logical solution for some, I am sure, but neither is an option for me.  This is a huge dysfunction of this expensive headset that needs to be noted. Comfortable, sounds great, but lacks documentation. Transmitter positioning critical."
3.0	"2 Total War games were released prior to Rome: Total War, which set the stage for one of the best PC strategy games. Shogun, it's debut, introduced the ""chess piece"" movement system, cut scenes for actions, historical updates, and real-time combat; while Medieval placed those elements in a more familiar, Western location.

Rome: Total War introduced a new movement system, which determined battle locations by armies' locations on the campaign map; no more were the battle maps randomly generated according to elements in a province, such as mountains, forests, or plains. It also introduced much better graphics in both the campaign and battle maps, as well as a better interface. It also introduced religious bonuses, such as experience, population, law, and happiness received for building shrines to certain deities..

I have played Rome: Total War since 2004, and I have conquered the Romans, and Europe with most available, and some unlockable, factions. I took elephants over the Alps with Carthaginian generals; I conquered the British Isles with the Germans; and I took all the lands historically held by the Greeks. I've mastered Diplomacy in the game, though it took some adapting to v1.5's more difficult Diplomacy. And I learned how to spread the plague to enemy cities.

The Gold Edition I own is a 4 CD set, with a lengthy manual for the vanilla game, a smaller manual introducing the elements of Barabarian Invasion, and a map of the known world, showing the location of each settlement in the game. The new Gold Edition I recently purchased came with 1 DVD. Needless to say, I was disappointed with the lack of manuals and the map I use every time I play. After searching through the contents of the DVD, I found a .pdf of the manual, but no map. Though I bought my friend a brilliant game, I feel that he was cheated out of the best resources the Gold Edition had to offer.

The lack of enclosed manuals with games is a cheap stab at gamers by producers who already treat us as if we're theives, install secret software we can't uninstall (SecuROM) to ensure we're not thieves, and make shorter and less interesting games with better graphics. What good does a .pdf manual do if we can't read it while gaming? The same question applies to Online manuals and maps. We continue to pay full price for games, yet the content enclosed becomes little more than a DVD and a URL to the game manual. Because Activision is too cheap to enclose the necessary accessories to this game, which were enlosed in earlier releases, I am giving this product an average score. The game itself is a 5/5 and has yet to be bested, and I'm looking forward to Rome II: Total War. Total War's Finest Offering"
3.0	I suspect this game is supposed to highlight the touchscreen on the DS.  I would much prefer that one of the direction pads control the characters though.  Other than the screwy controls, I think it's an awesome game, but I'm noting my objection to this tomfoolery. Weird controls
3.0	"The unit was easy to setup and get going.  The audio quality is OK.  The only problem I had with it is the volume was lower than I would have preferred.  At its price level the P4C provided performance competitive with other devices on the market.

The P4C provides a low cost solution to use with the PS4 and is OK for those on a budget. Performance is Fair"
3.0	"This is a good solid multi-button mouse that is smooth and has a nice design to it.

I however cannot recommend this mouse. The mouse wheel broke on me and it will not recognize the mouse button click. I use this in a lot of games and programs and now have to switch back to my old naga that is still kicking. Great mouse with a flaw in the mouse wheel design being prone to breaking."
3.0	I love crimson skies, and i had this game in mind when i picked up blazing angels. This game is nowhere even close to the game crimson skies was. The dogfight matches are very slow paced, and aiming is harder than you think. Something that makes the dog fights boring is that you are caught turning constantly. In cromson skies you could do a spin around are stuff like that. In this you cannot. i know the game is trying to be a bit more realistic, but since this feature is not in the game, the dog fights go very very slowly and end up in alot of turning and shooting randomly. The game is very boring, but the graphics are great. Is worth the extra money for the 360 version if you have a choice and enjoy the game Its no crimson skies.
3.0	Good Megaman game for Megaman X all the way to X6 man I wish they would put this on the PS4 Good Megaman game for Megaman X all the way to ...
3.0	With an ever growing list of games being made based on older, classic films (the Godfather, From Russia With Love, the upcoming Dirty Harry), it seems kind of natural for the Al Pacino gangster classic Scarface to make the transition as well, and it's finally here.  The eagerly awaited Scarface: The World is Yours puts you in the shoes of Tony Montana as you are on a mission of revenge to reclaim your empire and blow away anyone standing in your way.  Now the first thing you'll notice here is that Tony looks like Al Pacino (unlike Michael Coreleone not looking like him in the Godfather game), but the Pacino sound-alike voicing Tony isn't very good.  The graphics aren't too bad and serve their purpose, while the environments are varied enough and resemble the early 80's Miami location of the film.  The controls should feel right at home for the most part for veterans of GTA, the cars handle very well, the game is easy to pick up and play, and there's a decent amount of music and songs from the film's soundtrack that reflect the era.  And that's all the good points of Scarface, and after that, it's all downhill.  The voice acting is horrible and the dialogue is even worse, even though it is humerous to hear Tony curse when no one is around.  Not to mention that when you remove the Scarface license, the game is just a generic GTA clone that overdoes on the cursing, language, and violence (then again, this is Scarface after all, so it pretty much hits the nail on the head).  However, my biggest gripe with the game is only because I am a lifetime fan of the film, and it may not sit well with others as well, but that depends on how much you value the film.  The game's beginning takes place at the end of the movie, as Tony's estate is being swarmed by assassins and you have to blast your way out.  As we all know, Tony died at the end of the film (and there's no coming back from all the bullets he took, let alone the fall from the balcony) and the game changes it all around just to justify itself.  If you can get over that, you'll find a somewhat enjoyable GTA-clone that makes good on it's source material, but there was a lot of wasted potential here to make something really special. Mixed bag
3.0	my son stated it was not as good as he thought.  He does not use it much. Three Stars
3.0	Cool game and fun most of the time. I am not really a fan of the cell shading because I view that as a copout. I view cell shading as a way for developers to escape making a visually stunning game. Gearbox is definitely not known for making visually stunning games, and this one is not visually stunning. My biggest problem with the game were some of the weapons. The rocket launchers and grenades are extremely underpowered, especially when you are fighting a boss. They are virtually useless when they are supposed to be among the most powerful weapons in the game. Also, make sure that you are at least three or more levels above any boss you plan to take on, because if you are not, you will have an extremely hard time defeating them. This game is fun but I really don't see what the hype was all about! Don't believe the hype!
3.0	Sometimes have trouble downloading free stuff from Xbox live Gold. Three Stars
3.0	"I remember playing this for awhile. One of my friends rented it for a few days and that's all it took to beat it.
Lamborghini 64 is a generic racer that could have been better but isn't. Even though it was released in 1997, don't go in with high expectations as there are better racers available.

You pick a car and then you choose to go in one of several modes. To unlock additional cars, you have to go through the story mode and beat the 6 tracks this game has to offer. Once you do that, they are available in the multi-player mode where you and 3 other players can race against each other. That's pretty much it.

The PROS: If you're into lamborghinis, then you will have some fun with this game. The graphics and music are decent. The sound effects are pretty good. Unlocking the additional cars doesn't take much time so you can use them for the multi-player mode.

The CONS: Well it's pretty generic. Nothing here really stands out. It's just an okay game overall. The controls are pretty floaty so you will have to get used to them first. It's a short game so after you finish it, there is nothing left to do.

I was underwhelmed after I finished Lamborghini 64 and you will feel the same way too. This game would be most enjoyed by those who are into lamborghinis as it does an okay job of capturing the feel of racing in one of these nice cars. But there are better racers available so unless you really want to get this game (and for a real cheap price), you are better off taking a pass on this game. A generic racer"
3.0	Bought as a gift for my brother and the product no longer works. It does not charge the controllers any just from regular use. Good while it lasted
3.0	"This review is for the TechNet M288 wireless gaming mouse. The mouse has a great shape and fits the hand very well. Tracking seems to be quite good. Wheel scrolls smooth and quiet. Good wieght with AA bateries in it. Buttons feel good. Build quality seems good too.

Now the problem, this mouse CANNOT have its extra buttons reprogramed to do what you want. They come preconfiged to things like control, shift and double click. Which so far to me have been useless. Usb dongle also feels a bit cheap but hey its a cheap mouse.

If you don't care so much about the extra buttons and just want a mouse that works good, feels nice in your hand, and has a few nice features like the blue LEDS and auto sleep to save battery. Then you'll like this mouse. Other wise look else where.

I also tried a program called XMouse to alter some of the buttons and it worked but not with great success. So now this mouse just sits in a drawer as a backup... The mouse has a great shape and fits the hand very well"
3.0	Very short. Three Stars
3.0	WET is certainly all about style over substance, but the rather short main story will not keep you occupied for too long. The presentation and music is spot on, but aside from a few achievements and challenge modes, there will be very little reason for most players to come back after one playthrough. Wet is not quite wet enough!
3.0	I'm a collector and try to pick up all games from all systems for cheap. When you see a game for sale for a penny you just have to jump on it. For me this was a great deal to add another item to my collection but for a player this might not be that great. That is because you need the gun to play this game. The gun is actually somewhat hard to find and most sellers on here do not in fact include the gun for sale. You might have better luck on ebay for getting all the things that you need to play this game but sometimes it doesn't hurt to pick up a penny game to add to a collection anyway. Need the gun to play. Most sellers on here are just selling the cartridge.

3.0	Bought this controller to use on my PS3 and even thou i look the look and grip of the controller, it lacks the respond time and precision needed to play certain games like some fighting games, racing games and FPS games. This controller has lag input delay, for COD games and GT6 (the only racing game i tested) and the D-pad isn't stable and precision enough to accurate input your direction commands in fighting games. Besides that i love the controller mainly for the look. it lacks the respond time and precision needed to play certain games like some fighting games
3.0	"I bought Hour of Victory today and I played through part of the first mission and so far I like the game up to a certain point.  I noticed right away the game has some good points and it has some bad points.

First with the good points.  The graphics are really good and the enemy soldiers acts just the way you would expect them to.  They run and hide for cover whenever they can.  It is not real easy to get past the enemy soldiers.  The A.I. is not too bad.  At the beginning of the game there are three different soldiers with different skills you can choose to play throughout the game. You can hit the enemy head on with one soldier who is expert at running and gunning.  Or if you want you can choose another soldier who is a expert with a sniper rifle to climb up on a rope to a building roof top to shoot down below at the enemy.  Or you can choose another soldier who is an expert at sneaking up on the enemy to cut through barb wire and pick the locks to open doors to buildings. Each soldier has special skills that is unique to that particular soldier.  You decide before the beginning of each mission what soldier you want to be in the game.  I also like the background music in the game.  It really adds to the atmosphere.

Now for the bad points. The game is not perfect.  The game developers need to come out with some patches to fix Hour of Victory not to be just a good game, but to be a great game.  I hate how game developers show you screen shots and game videos of what the game is suppose to look like and then when you buy the game and start to play it you find out the game looks and acts totally different.  The first thing the game developers need to do is do away with the gigantic weapon's crosshair circle that is permanently in front of you every where you go.  You can't get rid of it.  It is very annoying to have a gigantic crosshair circle in front of you everywhere you go.  It ruins the game because the graphics are great and then you have this stupid huge crosshair circle that is constantly in front of you blocking your view.  I didn't see this gigantic weapon's crosshair circle in any of the game's screenshots or videos.  So why put it in the game?  I don't get it. Second, give the player a choice on how to set up your Xbox 360 game controller.  I don't like how the controls are set up now on the game controller and you can't change them.  When I'm using a weapon, I like the aim button for using your iron cross sights in front of the controller.  I don't like the way it is set up now by pressing the right stick down to try to aim a weapon.  It is on the same side as the firing button on your controller.  You can't change it.  What is up with that?  On the main menu in the game where options selection is, you can't really do anything to change the game.  In fact there are hardly any choices at all to change the game settings.  It almost feels like the game developer are saying your going to play the game the way we tell you to and you can't change anything.  Hey we're not babies.  Let us have the the options or choices on how to set up and play the game.

Game developers need to give a player choices on how to play a game.  Let the player decide how they want to play the game.  Don't force the player to be stuck playing a game one way and that is it.  I recommend getting Hour of Victory only after the game has been fix with patches.  Playing the game the way it is set up now is way too frustrating.  I love World War II games as long as there done right by the game developer.

(Quick Update: I contacted the game publisher Midway to see if you can change anything in the game and they told me that you are stuck with the game the way it is. I am very disappointed.  It is really sad.  The game had so much potential.  This will be another game that will be hitting the bargain bin in the near future.)

What this game does is give you a small taste of what is coming out later on this year when on August 28, 2007 Medal of Honor: Airborne comes out. Now there is a game that looks like it being done right by the game developers.  That is definitely going to be one of top games of the year. I can't wait for Medal of Honor: Airborne to come out. Even though Hour of Victory has it faults, I guess it will just have carry me over until Medal of Honor: Airborne comes out later on this summer. Hour of Victory is Not a Bad Game But Could Be Better."

3.0	"Okay folks - this is yet another boring, middle-of-the-road Playstation 3 game. Amazon has given us a game description, I'll offer my thoughts on them.

[High-impact, brutal combat. Dismember enemies and experience high-impact melee combat unlike any game you've played.]

(My reply) Well, the combat is brutal, I will give you that. Dismemberments, decapitations, they are here, and they are plentiful. However, this combat style isn't unique, I've played several games like this. You'll use two buttons most of the time: One button for strong (but slow) attacks, and another button for weak (but fast) attacks. Been there, done that, bought the CD. Some of the fights with mini-bosses requires a ""key in the correct sequence"" of buttons to finish an enemy. Sorry, this was already done in God of War and God of War 2.

[Mythical powers. Tame dragons and command them to rain fire upon your enemies. Power up your weapons with elemental abilities and lay waste to your adversaries.]

(my reply) While raining fire on enemies with dragons is very cool, it does get old after a bit. The elemental power-ups for the weapons give us an edge in combat, but we've already seen this before. Freezing enemies and shattering them? That's old school, Mortal Kombat stuff. Catching enemies on fire? That's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PSI-OPS-Mindgate-Conspiracy/dp/B00008XKZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PSI-OPS Mindgate Conspiracy</a>&nbsp;battle tactics. Using lightning to take out our enemies? Again, Mortal Kombat. With the upgrades, Viking is a little more interesting than the average hack 'n' slash game. However, the fighting engine has a collision error: it only works on level ground. If the distance between the character and his enemies is altered because of a hill/mountain, all those well-placed combos can miss, opening the player up for a crushing counterattack.

[Three open-world environments. Explore, uncover and fight your way across huge Norse worlds full of combat and exploration.]

(my reply) Yes, there are 3 worlds to explore, but the exploration isn't as open as you'd think. You move through one world at a time, and it isn't like Grand Theft Auto III or Oblivion, where you have tons of side quests to keep you entertained: Viking is a very linear game. Typical quests are freeing Vikings to join your cause by beating the snot out of enemy forces, finding artifacts, or opening enemy gates. I was surprised a court jester didn't pop out from behind a tree saying I could harness the power of the atom by bringing him the keys to the Wizard's sock drawer. Some of the quests are that lame.

[Climactic, epic battles. Lay the foundations for huge battles featuring hundreds of warriors at once. Subtly influence the battle through targeted assassination and sabotage, or wade in to save stricken allies.]

(my reply) Okay, this is where the game let me down big time. I was expecting to see battles akin to Braveheart, but instead I get a Dynasty Warriors rip-off type battle which is only possible after I complete a laundry list of quests first (gather more Vikings, open bridges, relinquish the keys to the Wizard's sock drawer, you get the point). The 'saving stricken allies' means you go up to a group of three guys tied to a tree and untie a rope to free them. That's it.

On the plus side, the in-game cutscenes between chapters are a huge plus - they are reminicent of a Frank Miller comic, and it's sad there aren't more of them.

Viking is not a terrible game, but it's also nothing extraordinary. It has incorporated Mortal Kombat and Psi-Ops fighting elements, Tenchu's stealth tactics, Dynasty Warriors' battle mode and God of War's mini-games and chest opening sequences. On the whole, this Frankenstein combination doesn't deliver a lasting, engrossing game for me. I can't honestly see a reason for someone to own this game; especially since you'll probably never play it again after completing it. This game can be finished in about a week, hardly worth its high price tag. This game could be headed for a Viking Funeral."
3.0	"This game is very entertaining, in an action filled, 3rd person shooter style. While it is fun to mow down endless enemies, it can sometimes get repetitive, which does not help fuel your desire to ""play just one more level"" or even finish the game. The plot is an integral part of this game, in the old ""hard-boiled "" detective style genre. If you like to watch cutscenes this game is for you, otherwise you might have some problems, as you are forced to sit through most videos.

3.0	"BloodRayne is another third-person action game featuring a typically scantily clad female vampire as the main character.
The first part of the game is actually pretty boring... so don't give up on it right away.  After an hour or so the game does beging to get pretty cool.
You play the game as Agent Rayne, a half-human, half-vampire who has all of a vampire's traditional strengths yet hardly any of its weaknesses.
The controls of this game are really easy.  You can pick up any of the weapons that the bad guys dropped.  Even better is that firing the weapons are as simple as pressing a button, since the weapons auto-target.
Overall, I think this game has really low replay value and that makes it suited to be a rental. Save your money.. just rent it."
3.0	"The history goes like this. The founder of Nintendo attended one of Mike Tyson's fight and became inspired to give him a three year deal for the right to sell boxing NES game by using his name and likeness. It became Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!. After Mike was famously upset by James ""Buster"" Douglas, Nintendo decided not to renew the contract. The original misconception was that it occurred after the rape allegations which wasn't true. Hence, his character was replaced by Mr. Dream, the white version of Mike Tyson, and the game was subsequently renamed Punch-Out!!, permanently souring the game.

Long considered the Holy Grail of all Bosses in any NES game, Mike Tyson is the toughest to defeat, and anyone's status as a gamer elevates once he has beaten the archnemesis. At least that's how I felt when I finally beat Mike Tyson for the first time in my life after so many painstaking tries. I remember in the 80's that the popular saying was, ""Mike Tyson is so hard that Mike Tyson himself can't beat him."" That's the reason why Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! remains one of the greatest NES games in the history. The game takes a lot of strategy, great timing, and superb reflexes. Once in a while, there is luck involved. As a kid, the farthest I got was Bald Bull II. Recently, now after picking the game up after so many years of absence, I finally got past him with ease and began to view Mr. Sandman and Super Macho Man with a greater challenge. Eventually, with many practice, they both got easier for me. Finally, the ultimate challenge had arrived for me. It would prove my standing as the ultimate gamer. I was determined to beat Mike Tyson no matter what, no matter how long it took, and no matter how hard it was going to be. After a few hours one day and then an hour the next day, I had tasted the sweet taste of victory. I was very glad to have beaten everybody in the game.

Just a few side notes about the game. Mike Tyson, I believe, has never played the game before. Ever notice that when Glass Joe raises his arm up, his eye becomes weirdly out of place? I've always felt that Doc is the most useless trainer I've seen, and he just keeps saying absolutely irrelevant things during breaks. At one point, Mac says, ""Help! Help!"" Then he answers him back with, ""Join the Nintendo Fun Club today!"" What the hell...thanks for the pep talk, NOT. Speaking of Mac's whiny complaints, every time he thinks that he can't win the fight or whatever, I end up winning it for him. Just a pitiful attitude. Finally, now answer me this...how is it possible for a 103 pound weakling to get back up after being landed by one of Mike Tyson's punches of death? That should have sent Mac either to coma or death. Why do you think the 200 lb. fighters got knocked out silly by Mike Tyson during the 80's fights? Oh yes...one clue to how to get the health bar raised after a break between two rounds is to press the SELECT button repeatedly. Sometimes, it's useless because I only got so little of it. But it's better than nothing, I suppose. All in all, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! is a true NES classic and is one of the most hardest games in NES history. Below are the strategies in how to beat the game. Check my youtube videos per stage by typing in ""Mr. Math Expert Mike Tysons Punch-Out!!,"" so you can see what I mean.

Piston Honda II Walkthrough: Password: 032 730 8442. He is just like the first Piston Honda but much easier. Just dodge his punches and counter them back. At 1:00, he steps back for a second and then come back in. Now, this is really important: this must be done simultaneously, not before or after. As soon as he is in the process of moving forward, belly punch him. He is out for good. If you fail to get it done, then try it again at 2:00. Otherwise, get the stars and star-punch him.

Soda/Vodka Popinski Walkthrough: A lot of players thinks Soda/Vodka Popinski is tough to beat. But really, he is a joke. The biggest reason why is because his punches are slow coming due to probably a freeze glitch. Just dodge and counter punch all the way through the match. Occasionally, maybe if you feel like it, you can cover your head up to block his short punches until he is ready to do the massive power punch. At that moment he is set up to do that, there is a freeze glitch, and when that happens, get back to normal stance and belly punch him. Then delay a bit before you dodge his another massive punch. Punch him in the head to grab the star once before you star-punch him. He gets knocked out flat no matter how much power he has. One problem with this strategy is that Vodka may occasionally dodge the star punches. So, it's not very reliable as the dodge-and-counter method which I prefer more.

Bald Bull II Walkthrough: Bald Bull II is perhaps the second challenger of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, but he is not that hard. In fact, he is a great warmup for reflex practice which is absolutely required for Mr. Sandman, Super Macho Man, and Mike Tyson. If not for Ball Bull 2, it gets hard later. Basically, he is no different from the previous Bald Bull: just dodge and counter. Once again, he does the Bull Charge, but this time, he has the long version and the short version. The former, always dodge it no matter what, and the latter, belly punch him on the third hop. Over time, Ball Bull II is pretty easy.

Don Flamenco II Walkthrough: Again the washed up version of Rocky Balboa. Don Flamenco II is a bit difficult to fight because of the timing of his punches, but when mastered, he is easy because he takes a while to knock Mac off. He displays three type of punches: the straight punch, the back hand punch, and the Flamenco oval punch. Once you understand how each works, he becomes a joke. Pretty much, it's dodge and counter all the way through.

Mr. Sandman Walkthrough: Mr. Sandman is the third challenger of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! but really the first real, formidable challenger of the game. This is purely all about superb reflexes. The first 7 to 10 punches he throws are very tough, so learn how to dodge them and throw only one face-jab. Afterwards, he switches over to a simple back hand punch. Make sure to jab him in the head before countering and belly-punching him three times. Keep doing it. The best part of him is his Dreamland punches. You start dodging them three times; the first time he starts flashing, you dodge it right after, not just exact instant it happens, but just right after. Then dodge left two more times as you get hang of it. Now...this is really important. Most people do not realize this. After the very third dodge, face-jab him once and then belly-punch him ten times.

Super Macho Man Walkthrough: Password: 267 853 7538. Super Macho Man is the second real, formidable opponent of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! In reality, he is just like Vodka Popinski except that he is quicker in his punches. Sometimes, he is pretty much wide that it doesn't really matter how well you dodge. Just dodge and counter. The small version takes 4 face-jabs while the big version takes 6 face-jabs. Now, for the Super Macho Spin which always happens right after you knock him out (it never occurs randomly), just like how you did with Mr. Sandman, watch for that flash and then dodge right after that, never at the exact instant as it happens. While you are dodging his punches, do it rhythmically...not pressing LEFT rapidly and hard as you can which is a mistake. Just do it rhythmically every time you see his back turned around and then again and again. Then, face-punch him after it's all over.

Finally, at this point, you will start feeling that everybody else is pretty easy compared to Mike Tyson. Really, he just has no equal. This is the ultimate challenge of the game. This fight took me a lot of tries to master...after losing to him and going to the Reset button and typing in the password over and over. It was a lot of work although building up a lot of annoyance and anger at the same time. Pretty much the key of the game is superb reflexes in the first 90 seconds. As soon as you see the flash, dodge fast and then hit him in the face fast. Listen, this is important...it takes practice and dedication. If he hits you on right side, hit him in the face right side and vice versa. I say this because if you do it wrong way, the damage is minimal. Now, right after the first punch, delay (and always keep holding the UP button in the entire time) a bit before you throw him a face punch. You will realize that these two punches will do more damage than a simple two quick jabs to the face. Keep trying that method until you have mastered it. It took me a while even though I had a hard time believing in it, but it will WORK. Remember...match his first side punch and then delay a bit before another face punch. Your number one goal in here is to limit yourself to one knockout (zero can be greatly accomplished, but it's an endurance match) of Mac. Get knocked out more than one time, you don't stand a chance of winning. Finally, after the 90 second brutal display of punches of death, Mike gives up and starts throwing the same repeated pattern of punches. Look for the blink of his eye and then dodge and counter. At this point, you should knock him out once by 2:40 although I recommend keeping his power bar to the bare minimum to the end of first round without knocking him out (it doesn't really matter at this point; what is important is surviving the first 90 seconds with one knockout or less; once done, you are pretty much in the clear for the rest of the way).

Now, as soon as second round starts, your biggest challenge is dodging his first ten super fast punches. Don't even think about countering back on any of them. As soon as he gives up, he reverts back to the same old tired routine from the second half of the first round with occasional punch of death (but this time, less damaging). He gets easier to work with, and you should be able to knock him out more often. At this point, you should be able to grab a star from time to time with a delay punch; I am not sure how it works, but they do come nevertheless. They are valuable in terms of reducing his health bar, but the star punches just have to be timed at the right time. Finally, there is an odd pattern coming from Mike Tyson. Most of the time, I get frozen out because I wasn't sure what to think of. Honestly, this is the greatest chance of the entire match to knock him out right away. As soon as he starts blinking both eyes, star-punch him in the face immediately to knock him out for the second time. As soon as he comes out, it's a race to third knockout before the bell rings. Keep up your patience, and don't lose your form. It's not over yet, and don't celebrate yet; just keep at it before you finally get it. If you get to third round, it is actually easier because Mike was never known for going the distance. Pretty much the best hope for a win is one knockout in first round, two knockouts in second round, and at least one knockout in third round to reach 5000 points to get a favorable decision.

I made YouTube videos to show people how to beat this game, so go in there and search for ""Mr. Math Expert Mike Tyson."" Not the Same Thing."
3.0	Wish they had a electronic delivery eletronic please
3.0	and fit just right.  Have the same type for my PS3 controllers and they also are good, BUT after playing  long and hand sweat moisture does get under the thin rubber after playing for a long time.  Would recommend removing from time to time to dry out.  Also my charging station for the PS4 controllers will not accept the controller with this sleeve on and have to remove it in order to recharge.  Would give five stars, but because of the moisture problem I cant.  Other then that, fit, style, price and color make these a good addition to items for the system. Feel good
3.0	I compared this one with Logitech g710+ and found it less exciting in comparison. Firstly, the keys are louder and less springy (more old-school) because it lacks silencers that Logitech has out of the box. Then the key layout is something I last saw on keyboards from 80's/early 90's, which is a bit different from what I'm used to. I also like the separate media keys, backlights and the extra macro side keys found on g710+. Steelserious does not have backlights, but has overly bright caps/nunmlock lights, which definitely would be annoying at night. The only advantage of Steelseries is its very comfortable and cool-looking arm-rest. There are better options for less money
3.0	"This appealing little game has wonderful graphics, complete with Bullfrog's trademark zooming/rotating camera (a la Dungeon Keeper) and an almost SimCity/Age of Empires feel. Neither heavy on the military (though  the object of the game is to wipe out your enemies) nor on the building,  the main gameplay consists of building enough huts to amass a big enough  army to wipe the enemy out.  This is particularly easy on the first few  levels.
The only general twists are in the requirements that you discover  technology by worshipping totem poles and pyramids (which again isn't  necessary at the lower levels, despite what the scenario info may  suggest).
Individual scenarios are more like puzzles. An early one gives  you fifteen minutes to worship an ""angel of death"" statue, which  lies deep in the heart of enemy territory. Once you figure out what needs  to be done, executing the plan is relatively simple (though somewhat  time-consuming; the game relies a lot on time-consuming tasks).
There  isn't really a lot of ""game"" here, outside of the puzzles,  probably less so than in the original Populous, but its look and interface  give it an undeniable appeal, a kind of ""well, that's cool""  factor.
Oh, it is also somewhat unstable (even with the latest patches)  in my experience (four different machines with different graphic cards)  which is unfortunate, and the main reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 4. Appealing, simple puzzle game."
3.0	"Not the best reviewer here but here I go.

I've received this product in the mail not too long ago. It does what it says but the only complaints I'm going to make about the product. If you want to play the Wii in 1080p. You MUST own a HDMI cable for this product, then you set your input settings to what ever your HDMI cable is plugged into. Now my problem is, If you put the HDMI Converter in full HD on the Wii. For example, I've played The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. I put it in full HD. And I was having Lines across my screen. The HD its self works but it was messing with my screen. Then when you have it on Netflix it makes weird sounds. And the unit its self gets hot. Not the Wii console, the unit. Sorry for my bad review. But I'm not satisfied with this product. I'll check out other brands and see if they are better with this one. Not the best product but does the job."
3.0	"Not as shhort as these reviwers will make you think (""it's SOOOO short"", YEAH RIGHT), very bloody and gory, you can tear people apart into little pieces and then eat them, The camera sucks at times, graphics are pretty good but could've been better, Worth the used & new price but don't buy this new. Honestly, it's not what it was hyped uo to be: at times you will want to play this so damn bad, you'd give money to play it, but then after 15/20 minutes you'd be like ""Damn did i really ever want to play this"" because it gets so boring and repetitive. All that's fun is freestyle but when there's only 10 different kind of boats in the whole ocean and each boat has a maximum of 2(count) people, and the people say the same lines OVER AND OVER it does get boring pretty quickly.

the m rating does deserve to be here however since jaws is a shark and sharks naturally eat people this game should be okay for anyone 14 and older. It is gory but it's not like Grand theft Auto where you just go and kill random people for no reason (PARENTS)

buy it used if you can.

not terrible, but i'd recommend that if you were to get the choice of any 1 game for free, Choose another. boring after a few minutes, repetitive, glitches..."
3.0	not as fun as Tropico 4. Three Stars
3.0	When I heard that Aerosmith was going to be involved with the next Guitar Hero game, I was pretty excited.  I have several Aerosmith CDs from the Geffen days (Pump, Permanent Vacation, Get a Grip), and their greatest hits album.  I considered myself a fan.  Too bad few of my favorite songs made it into the game.  Instead we are treated to Cheap Tricks, Dream Police..........ugh.  King of Rock by Run DMC is an OK song, it just doesn't translate over to Guitar Hero very well.  Even the good songs aren't that fun to play.  The keystrokes aren't layed out very well.  Where in past games, you kind of got the feeling that you were playing the song, ie Mississippi Queen, and Pride and Joy, in this one you just feel like you are hitting buttons.  There isn't a nice flow.  If you play GH you know what I am talking about.  This game isn't all bad.  Wii owners will be pleasantly surprised to see that the graphics have been upgraded, and this one is in stereo.  I never really noticed on GH3 but evidently not being in stereo got alot of people bent.  I would love to give this game my whole hearted recommendation but alas I can only say that it wasn't a total waste of money.  I think I will put GH3 back in and wait till Christmas when my son opens his Rock Band.  Can't wait! Not up to par
3.0	"I rented this game for my four year old son, who is quite adept at gaming. It took less than ten hours playing time to beat the story, although we could have taken our time and added another hour or two by defeating every piece of food and unlocking some extras. But since I wasn't about to pay [...] for the game, I wanted him to beat it before sending it back.

The game is fairly straight-forward, kill the food, save the town. Most levels were easy enough for my son to navigate and defeat without help, but occasionally I did need to join in to help him out. My advice is to activate the second player (I call it a dog, my son informed me that it is Steve) even if no one is playing it, just in case the main character dies. If at least one player is alive, the second one will automatically come back to life. Otherwise, if you die, you start back at the checkpoint.

If this game was more reasonably priced, I would give it a higher rating. But at [...], I expect a lot more out of a game. The Lego franchise, for example, is priced lower and provides significantly more playing time. Cute, but short and a little hard in places"
3.0	Deatail is great, but the programming to keep the game going is crap.  The game crashes, or does not even load.  Saves don't consistently save. I hope Bethesda fired these knuckleheads before they programmed DLCs and the other Fallout games. Fallout 3 Ops programming is crap
3.0	If you like match games, you'll like this. Attractive cut scenes. When you complete a level, more interesting stuff gets added to the cut scene. There is a relaxed mode. You can earn trophies. After playing for only 10 minutes, I had earned 5 trophies. As you progress, the trophies can be upgraded (from tin to bronze, etc.). Nice music, not too distracting. Decent Match Game
3.0	"I appreciate the long-winded, though overly verbose, descriptions some of you have sent in.  Comparisons to Halo, however, are well off the mark.  This game lacks the single-most important characterisic of that shooter - ease of control.  The hero moves very slow.  You have no idea how much energy he has without a life meter, so getting shot by the enemy while trying to evade fire is especially frustrating.  I noticed he does move very fast when activating ""special"" covering moves.  This makes the controls even more absurd.  So here we are, laboring to walk, but if I push ""a,"" as one critic on this site said, ""he moves like a chipmunk on crack...""

The reality is... none of these games are realistic.  So saying Halo is not as realistic as Gears is like saying the aliens in that game are less believable then those here.  ""Locus Hordes,"" ok, enough said about that.  But, that's not why we pay $60 for these games is it?  I just want the guy to act when I push the button.  That's all.  I'm not even going to delve into the merits of this game - graphics, storyline, complexity.  All of that doesn't matter if I have to play the same checkpoint over five times because he refuses to move, duck, and jump.  It gets a little frustrating.

Reality is, I'm still playing Halo 2 on a console that it wasn't designed for.  Guess I will be until someone can make another shooter ""fun"" to play. Does not live up to the hype"
3.0	"Works well, but you have to use a ""claw"" grip on the mouse. I prefer having some support for the bottom part of my hand (near the wrist). It also features a very bright LED Corsair logo, which is too bright for a dark bedroom, since it stays on even when the PC goes to sleep. In order to turn it off or change the color, you have to download and install their massive 176 MB Corsair driver. Large 176 MB driver"
3.0	I absolutely hated this game when I started playing it as first. The multiplayer gameplay was just horrible compared to all the other CoD games I've played. It always felt like you died instantly every time and it was very frustrating. However after a few months of learning all the maps and finding classes that I actually like, it started to get a little better. The last CoD game I played was Black Ops II and I must say that it was much better compared to this game. It takes getting used to
3.0	"TLDR:  None of the keys give a very good response so my fingers largely feel blind compared to a normal or mechanical keyboard.  This is actually a pretty big problem for the thumb modifiers as you hit them with the side of your thumb, so unless you put a very very large amount of time memorizing the exact position/getting used to them you're going fat finger, a lot (the thumb modifiers largely feel like 1 maybe 2 buttons instead of 7).

Pros:
+Razer software with all razer kb lets you put macros into any key (f can mash f and x for you)
+Thumb buttons have the potential to be more convenient modifiers than a normal keyboard
+Keys are space nicely apart so that fat fingering doesn't happen all the time, though it does happen

Cons
-Keyboard gives little response with actuation
-The slight bar that lets you feel what thumb modifier is on is so slight I didn't know it was there until I was staring at the kb
-Too many modifiers stuck right on top of each other.  This would have been much better with alt cntrl and maybe shift spaced apart like normal keys Razer seriously phoned this in, they should have put naga hex mechanical keys with raised edges, decently spaced apart.
-Lack of response in keys creates a lot of hand fatigue, especially holding down thumb modifiers in the new position
-There isn't anything like it on the market, if you get used to it and they pull the product you're out of luck Great idea, okay execution"
3.0	"Okay.  There were a lot of things I liked about this game, and a lot of things I didn't like.
I don't tend to be as fond of third person adventures.  And the keyboard control of the main character was very difficult! Although it was supposed to allow for precise movement, I found that it was extremely hard to get your man where he was supposed to go.  Some of the pans and changes of orientation were extremely disorienting, too.  I had to stop and re-orient myself in about every scene.
You die A LOT in this game.  I don't like that, much, myself.  I tend to prefer games where you don't die, or at least where you can revert to the place where you last saved without reloading the whole game.  Some of the ways you can die are pretty amusing, though.
Some of the puzzles are REALLY illogical.  I found myself going to the UHS hints quite a bit, which is annoying to me.  Many of the times I got hints, I would NEVER have figured the puzzle out without, because the answer just was not something that followed or made sense.
On the plus side, however, the graphics were decent.  I loved the mythological content (if you've read others of my reviews, you know I'm a mythology geek).  When you didn't die and the puzzles made sense, the game was really great and absorbing.  I especially liked the pig section;  now that was original thought!
All in all, pretty good with periods of tedium and frustration. Prepare to die!"
3.0	After reading all the reviews form other similar products i decided upon this item... it does push air just not as much as i had hoped or thought it would... either way it makes it easier for the Nyko inter cooler i have to suck the hot air out and that is a big advantage... plus any cooling helps... so far no RROD even after the fix. Not as good as i thought it was

3.0	"When it has came down to Jeopardy!, it has definitely delivered as one of the most successful and challenging game shows of all time. The show created by the late, great  Merv Griffin still connects so strongly with younger generations and new gamers whom are seeking a higher level of vast knowledge for so many reasons, still get addicted to the simple Q&A challenges of everyday trivia. Yet, the show in its 27th season has had highs and record-breaking moments including the 2 highest-grossing winners in game show history, Brad Rutter & Ken Jennings, and won the most Emmy Awards for a game show ever. But, it also has had a few troubles with trying to have a definitive game for video game systems. It has a new era that has just arrived for the Nintendo Wii, but what is Jeopardy! in a Wii game? The answer might surprise you.

Jeopardy! for the Nintendo Wii brings out a nice, intimate challenge by bringing the interactive gameplay of Alex Trebek & Jeopardy's clue crew in a nice, interactive gameplay by having you play the game with you & 2 of your friends at home. The questions are absolutely challenging, and the gameplay is solid & strong, as you compete in the classic reigns of Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! & Final Jeopardy! rounds of gameplay. The interactivity with the clue crew questions and the gameplay is good, but the gameplay has a few downfaults in the answer of the form of a question. The main fault is in the use of the Wii Speak microphone. At times, it can make the gameplay interactive a bit more like the game show, but it can be hard for the game to interact comprehensively with your voice. It does lose a bit of the gameplay. The second disadvantage is seeing Alex & company as the Mii-like characters. It kind of feels a bit freaky when you look at it, compared to when you see him and the clue crew on TV. I also wish there could've been a lot more in the way of questions, that is just saying something compared to the 8,000 puzzles in the Wheel Of Fortune Wii title.

Nevertheless, those are small complaints though. Despite those few faults, Jeopardy! for the Nintendo Wii is still a strong game for anyone whom needs their need of Jeopardy! fix for the Nintendo age. I liked the interactivity at home, and it handles well as one of the few game shows to deliver as a video game in its own right for years. I hope there is a second edition of the game for the Wii, so it can fix some of the faults in the answer in the form of a question. Then, the answer for the Wii can be even more fun.

3.0	"Intially when I tried out ""Black & White"" I began to tingle with excitement, this looked like it was going to be one hell of an addictive game. And true this game is very addictive, for the first few days that is. When you begin this game everything looks to be in place, great graphics, pretty easy to use controls and the gameplay looks to be promising. After just a short time later this game slams head first into the ground, and does not recover. Why is this you may ask, well to be honest this whole game consists of you doing the same thing over and over, except it increases how much you have to do to make it seem difficult than the previous time. It's a real shame too, this games originality is unsurpassed, because while many other games have the god aspect to a certain extent, none of them present it the way ""Black & White"" does. But do not give up all hope as of yet, some people do enjoy this game to it's fullest, so make sure you try it before you buy it, because you may end up loving it. The reason I gave ""Black & White"" 3 stars is because of how original it is, its graphics, and I even did enjoy this game for a very brief period of time. Great idea, great hype, but it crashed and burned."
3.0	"Batman Begins is based on the hit summer movie and best ever big screen adaptation of the Dark Knight character. It features the same all-star cast that made the movie great, as well as beautiful visuals that bring the movie to life. It also features many ideas and gameplay styles that fans have been waiting for in a Batman game. The problem? It's too easy.

The biggest failure of this game is that it had the potential to offer open-ended free-roaming gameplay, but instead restricts players to a set path, with a very specific way to get through that path. The game won't let you try other options to get around bad guys and puzzles, or if you do you'll pretty much wind up dead. How does the game restrict players? A good example is the use of the batarang. Batman can only hurl his trademark weapon at specific highlighted areas. He can *never* throw it at enemies, and he can never throw it at anything except the highlighted spot.

Everything just feels too pre-scripted. The game relies heavily on triggering things such as explosive barrels, falling platforms, etc. to scare enemies. These are supposed to make the environment feel interactive, but since you can't get through the level without activating them, they end up feeling tired and not very spontaneous. Even more puzzling is that while the game wants players to stay ""hidden"" and disarm their enemies through fear, after the thugs drop their guns you have to swoop down and beat them in hand-to-hand comabt anyway. It would've been cooler (and more Batman-like) to pick them off one by one from the shadows.

More game mechanics fail to impress. Interrogation is nothing more than grabbing an enemy and pressing 'b' until they spill their guts out. You can't stop the interrogation until you get what you need, and there's also no way to get wrong information or false information either. It's all basically a cutscene that pretends to be interactive. The Batmobile levels also feel pretty bland, and just don't offer any excitment or variety.

Still, the game's presentation oozes tons of style and Batman goodness. It's a treat hearing Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and the others voicing their characters. And the character models look exactly like the actors, and is some of the best facial modelling I've ever seen. This is pretty much the reason to try out the game.

Batman Begins is good in concept, bad in execution. It's playable and enjoyable, but at the same time it feels very restricted and linear. Really, this game wouldn't be half as fun if the Batman license weren't there to support it. Hardcore Batman fans should add this to their collections if they find it used or discounted. Everyone should stick with a rental to see the authenticity of the movie license. Batman Begins....very easily"
3.0	"I really expected a little more out of this game after playing the demo, but unfortunately this game is not that great. It does not offer any new gameplay elements that an older generation console could not also do. The story is pretty lame, such as when Nero can not get a control panel to work, so he gets an idea and steps back from it. He shoots it with his gun, the light changes from red to green, and then it works as he expects it to. Stupid!

The graphics are very good, especially the in game graphics. Fans of the series may enjoy this game, but new players should play one of the true next gen games like Uncharted: Drake's Fortune instead with a way better written, more compelling story. Excellent Graphics, lame story"
3.0	They are OK. I bought these to replace a set I had with a different volume controller on the line. The new one uses a knob which is horribly cheap feeling. They have also reduced the length of the cord from a nice long one to about half the length it was. That's not an issue if you want a shorter cord to prevent wire tangles but my tower is on the wrong side from where I keep the headset so the long cord was perfect. Not as good as the older version
3.0	was fun for the first hour, then when you realize how bad the controls are you just want to throw it. its fun, but FRUSTRATING!!! eh....
3.0	The only complaint I have about this memory card is the eighty dollar price on it. Other than that, this is the memory card you want for your Vita system. Great memory card. For the money, not so much.
3.0	"This game is nowhere near contemporaries in graphics, like Mafia 2, or gameplay. The movement of both the characters and cars is slow and awkward such as not being able to move around chairs, corners,etc without going only a certain way. It's a fun idea, GTA should do time periods as well, but it was just not done well here. This would be considered a ""B"" movie. Very glitchy, it crashes a lot especially during a lot of action, I have a quad core with 4GB of ram so it's not my rig. The ""Beta"" patch done 3 years ago still has not fixed these problems, guess they gave up on this one. If you don't have an xbox 360 gamepad you have to use a workaround. I'd pass on this, there are just too many great games out there for the money. kinda lame, amateurish"
3.0	"I've had my case for about a year now.  I use it all the time and this is the main things I noticed about it.  The case does its job by adding another layer of protection and some storage.  The case is has a rubbery lining.  The holders for the UMD's work fine.  I do wish the compartment for the PSP ""grabbed"" and held the PSP as well.  The hinged screen cover protects the screen but rarely latches.  Since the PSP isn't held firmly in place it can rattle in the case and so, over the last year, the left edge of the hinged screen cover has developed a rub mark on the face of my PSP.  Just to the right of the ""P"" of PSP.  One last thing; you have to open the case to charge the PSP.  It's not a big deal but they provide a cutout in the case to allow for this; it seems it should work then. could be better"
3.0	"Overall, this is a very good game. The battle system is innovative and mostly enjoyable, as it building up the characters. To an earlier review that said mages are useless: you just haven't built them up enough. At higher levels, their long-range makes them indispensable. The storyline is thin but somewhat interesting. Be warned that this is not an easy game: until you learn the intricacies of how everything works, you will face 'Game Over' many times. Even after you learn the game well, you'll still find yourself facing it often. However, one of the redeeming features of the game is the ability to restart the current battle without losing any experience you've gained. I might even suggest that the game is unwinnable without using this feature a lot.

The major drawbacks of this game are:
* The music is horrible and annoying. Worse, there is no option to turn off the music and keep the sound effects, so you'll quickly play this game with the volume turned all the way down
* The combat can be slow. Each attack is done with a long animated sequence which can be bypassed, but only after it starts up. Worse, the enemies can take a long time to attack, and go one by one. I don't know how powerful the CPU on a DS is, but you can literally count the seconds while an enemy thinks about the next step to make in stages with a lot of enemy options in it. So you'll find yourself putting the game down and doing something else for a while, leaving it running, so that you can come back to it when the enemy turn is finished. Which could be literally 5 minutes later.
* The shopping/quest system is poorly designed and the game would probably be the better without it.
* It would have been really nice if there were a visual indicator of how far each ally and enemy can move during a move. This is very important knowledge, and can be figured out manually by seeing how far a unit can move and then counting squares on the screen, but this can get tedious.
* The game is difficult, but a little more on ""stupid difficult"" than ""challenging difficult"". Some enemies will knock you out in one hit. There are slow, laborious ways to make your way through some levels without getting killed (e.g. the archer plus healer yo/yo move), but doing so gets real old real quick.

I know that's a lot of negatives, but the game is fun for a while. Some quick hints to max out the enjoyment for those who try this game: get the archer, and get Cotton. Use a cheat site to figure out how to get them. Also, powerup Marie and Margus. The rest of the characters don't really matter too much, although another magic user is handy later on, and someone with really long movement (e.g. 10) can be handy as well. Having Cotton makes the game difficult instead of nigh-impossible. Decent but annoying"
3.0	"I am a big fan of Pokemon and I have played every Pokemon game ad nauseum, so naturally I was very excited to hear about a similar franchise but something different enough to rock the boat on something as successful as Pokemon. There are several games in the Yokai series and this is the first. This franchise is extremely popular in Japan to the point where you will literately not be able to avoid seeing references to it as soon as you step foot in the country (if you live in a country outside of Japan that is). A Yokai in case you are wondering is something that translates to ""ghost"" in the USA, they are spirits that do naughty things when you are not noticing and are heavily based on Japanese culture.

I own this game, but I did not buy it here, but I figured I would leave a review so others can figure out if they want to buy it or not.

This game doesn't really live up to the hype. It has several problems which I can only hope are fixed in the next version of it. Is it similar to Pokemon, yes and no. You collect monsters, but everything else is very different. There are supposed to be over 200 yokai to collect in this game which there are. This is where the first problem comes in, you have to collect yokai by convincing them to join your team. This seems to be a very, very random thing, as in you cannot really influence it. They say you can convince a yokai to join you by feeding them their favorite foods but the game gives no indication of what food should be used on what yokai so this information had to be looked up online. After trying it out many times I found that it does not really improve your odds of getting a yokai to befriend you, and that the chance of getting a yokai to befriend you is totally random. Even if you do feed them the food you have to do this during battle and there is very limited time to do this during the battle and you cannot infinitely feed them the food because it only lets you use so many items per battle.... I played another game way back on the Game Boy Color called Revelations: The Demon Slayer and Demikids Light and Dark versions on the Game Boy Advance where you had to recruit monsters to join your team but you had to talk to the monster by choosing commands on the screen and based on the monster they would join or reject your party. I was secretly hoping the recruitment system was similar to this but alas it is definitely not.

Direction is horrible in this game, I find myself constantly getting lost and having no idea where I am going in this game. The game tells you to go to a specific place but does not tell you how to get there. Yes there is an arrow pointing you in the direction of where to go but this only tells you where to go for the main quest. The problem with this is the side quests, certain side quests need to be completed for the main quests to be completed and to progress in the game. There is no arrow to guide you to the place of the side quest. I am currently at a point where I need to do a side quest in order to upgrade my yokai watch so I can finish the next main quest and progress in the game but the arrow keeps pointing me towards the main quest that I haven't done enough to finish yet. Very frustrating and makes me not want to come back to this game to finish what I started. The only way to distinguish the different places is they change color when you go into them, its like a city that just runs together kind of..  There are no names or anything on the building so you have no idea which one is which unless you memorize everything.

There is no online play in this game and I don't see a way to transfer your yokai to the next game when it comes out. So everything you earn and do on this game will be stuck on the cartridge.  I am not even sure if you can trade anything to another player of the exact same game. This makes this game very unappealing to try and get everything, when I know it will be stuck on this cartridge, and cannot be transferred to the next game when it comes out. I will have to raise all my yokai all over again when the next game comes out. With Pokemon I have always been able to move my raised Pokemon onto the next game, which means I can keep my progress and Pokemon and memories. I have Pokemon from over 10 years ago all the way back to the GameBoy advance days that I can still use in the current gen games and from a time when I went through college and played with many friends, those are precious memories and Pokemon for me, and I was looking forward to creating a similar experience with this game. How this critical feature of a series based monster collecting game was left out I do not know. Again this makes this game very unappealing to me at this point, as it feels like I am wasting my time playing it because as soon as Yokai Watch 2 comes out in the USA if it does, this game will be utterly obsolete.

So yes there is lots of grinding this game, especially if you want to get more yokai, you might have to battle a yokai 20 or more times just for it to join you. You also have to grind for levels, I was going through the game and found myself woefully unprepared for the challenges, especially due to the battle system of this game, this lead to having to grind to level up.

The battle system: You pick a party of 6 yokai and use them to fight in a wheel shaped thing on the bottom screen. You have to play a mini game each time you want to attack. As you can imagine these mini games get old pretty fast.  But you can't attack infinitely and once you use up one attack you have to wait for the meter to fill up before you can attack with that yokai again. This kills the battle system, since each yokai only has one attack and can attack once until the meter fills up again if it has enough time in the same battle. You have to rotate the wheel as you can only have 3 yokai on the screen at the same time. This often leaves you waiting, unable to do anything until the meter fills up again so you just sit there and watch the yokai get beat on while you can't attack or do anything else. There are ways to make it fill up faster and yokai that can heal of course but those don't seem to help much.

The streetpass feature has been ruined in this game, you can't enable streetpass until 4-6 hours into the game, and you have to go to a certain place to do it, a place that most people will overlook. Therefore either no one in my area has this game or no one knows how to enable streetpass. Most games have you enable streetpass automatically as part of the setup of the game, this one does not. I get streetpasses for plenty of games just not this one. Another shortcoming of this game.

This game is very very juvenile, and I say this as a person who has played plenty of other kids games without worry in the past. But this game (and the anime that goes with it) feels like it was made for a 5 year old. I don't know anyone who has this game yet and basically no one has even heard of this series or franchise and almost everyone in my friends circle is a dedicated anime fan so its not like we have a problem with games or TV shows that are made for kids. For a series that is absolutely dominating in Japan its having a very hard time catching on in the USA. A great concept that has been ruined by a lot of shortcomings"
3.0	"Graphics- Really good. Lighting is awesome and the game play is smooth. It has a nice blur effect that helps you feel the speed.

Audio- Solid. Some items sound a bit forward but you can adjust it and find a good balance.

Game Play- Overall it is really good. The tracks are nicely done and the cars feel fleshed out. The AI is okay but at times can be bothersome.

Content- I wish there was 1000+ cars, it has under 200 at this time. It needs all of the tracks from all of the previous games. It is missing some must haves like Infineon, Laguna Seca, Fuji Speedway, Cape Ring, Apricot Hill, Spa, Circut De La Sarth, and others. In 16 days I have completed 97% of the content available. Past GT's have taken me a few months to complete. They are adding free content updates but at this slow rate it will take years to get all the great cars and tracks back. One make races are missing. Only two Porsche races. Almost no focus on building your car into a race machine. I think many players want to take a car and mod it as they progress. Gut it for weight, add a roll cage, power it up, swap the transmission, add an aero kit and so on.

Online- Pretty bad. The penalties also hurt the immersion. I do not like the fact that my game data  and save files are on their servers. If the server is offline you can not access your content. Needs Offline Support & More Content"
3.0	"It's a pretty fun GTA clone.  It's a lot like the free roaming mode in Mafia if you don't pay any attention to the story.. and if you're as big a fan of the Godfather movies as I am, I strongly suggest that you don't pay much attention to the story.

The best thing this game has going for it is the combat.  There are a million different ways to kill and maim people.  You can use your typical array of weapons from pistols to machine guns to explosives, or you can grab people and throw them through windows or off bridges and buildings, strangle them until you break their necks, head [...] them to death, throw them in front of cars, slam them into walls or other nearby objects.. etc.

If you want to waste an hour being a total psychopath, this really is quite a fun way to do it.

But that's about all there is to this game.  Sure, there's the ""story"", but I just can't recommend that part of it.  It's quite amazing the lengths to which the developers went in order to wedge you into the events of the book/movie.  Every single major event of the movie, your character is there to witness, and often has a big part in accomplishing.

For instance:  You're there to witness Don Vito's assassination attempt, and must drive him to the hospital... You're there to see Luca Brasi get whacked and must kill his assassin... You're the guy who plants Michael's gun in the bathroom and must drive him to the docks afterwards... You're there when Sonny is whacked and must chase down and kill his assassins... You're the guy who whacks Paulie... You're the guy who whacks Tessio... etc.. etc.. etc..

With all this madness revolving around you, you'd think the Corleones would have had you whacked on page 4.  It really is supremely stupid, and is an absolute disgrace to the beautifully complex and multi-layered story of the film.

All that aside, there is a good bit of fun to be had here.  I suggest sticking to the sidequests and doing the story last only if you have nothing else to do.

I've also heard that they're going to be making two more games to go along with the other two films.  YAY!  I predict that in part 2, you will play two roles: your character from this game and his father.  Get ready to help Vito whack Don Fanucci and help Al Neri whack Fredo all before lunch. In part 3, you get to poison the Pope!  Good times! a seriously stupid game"
3.0	"I have never played the original Condemned, so starting off with the sequel with already developed characters was a bit disorientating. I had absolutely no idea what to expect from this game, but for 5 I couldn't refuse, especially after the disappointing Resident Evil 5.

In Condemned 2 you play Ethan Thomas, a burnt-out drunk and former special agent. When people across the unnamed city start to go crazy you're brought in to kick some ass and find out why.

The game is set in the ugliest of places, from abandoned hotels, factories, back alleys. Everything is dank and depressing. The graphics are not the best but sure do impress with their grottiness. What IS remarkable though is the gut-wrenching sound design, which is not only the best video game sound I have ever heard but would rival the most superior of Hollywood horrors. If you have a home theatre hooked up to your PS3 then be prepared for a horrifying atmosphere made entirely of sound to flood into your living room.

But...a first person beat-em-up? I understand that the FP perspective makes the game even scarier, but it just doesn't fit a beat-em-up. When fighting bad guys your chances are almost down to luck with skill being nearly irrelevant.

However, since I was very much let down by RE5 I was surprised just how shocking and creepy Condemned 2 was. I was well worth the money and I recommend it despite it's flaws.

Pros:

Disgusting production design that will make you head straight for the shower.

Truly menacing sound.

Cons:

Clunky fight system

Load times are a pain.

Graphic B+ Sound A++ Gameplay B- Lasting Appeal B- Brutal, ugly, terrifying"
3.0	"I rented this game mainly because I needed a new RPG to start playing. I was extremely suprised at how good this game was; but it does have a few problems. Here's my review.

Graphics: 6.5/10. Cool and interesting creatures, decent looking worlds, the graphics are okay, but nothing super spectacular for a PSP game. There is very, very, very little character customization. Alchemist, Druid, Berserker, or Knight, and then only about 4 different selections for your hair, and 3 for skin color, and there you are. There are also ocassional slowdowns in gameplay too when the music loops. A good thing, though, is that the loading times are reasonable at about 30 seconds.

Sound: 6/10. The sound is just, there. Each creature makes it's own little sound, but there are subtitles, and your character only will make slight grunts. The music can get very annoying, as well. The sound is not really good at all.

Control: 7/10. The only problem with the control really is just the slightly annoying camera angle. In my opinion, this game would have been better just if the camera was better because you could get a better look of what you are doing and where you are going. Also, doing the special abilities isn't the easiest thing either; you use the D-Pad to cycle around, and if you are one of those people who will take a long time to do so, you will probably die.

Fun: 7/10. Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade is a fun little portable RPG with several places to visit, and it's all in good fun. But the biggest problem in this game ( it's really annoying ) is the weight. You will be finding yourself quite often having to go through your inventory and looking at things you want to drop for other things you want to pick up. That's the biggest problem with the game. What is cool, is that you can link up with a friend. ( I don't know for sure if you can play with more than one ) If you need to play a PSP RPG, this is one of your few choices, and I reccomend you try it out, even if it is pretty damn challenging.

7.2/10 Solid RPG"
3.0	the game is a ok game its not a game you need in my opinion but that is my opinion its ok
3.0	This game is fun to play...at first and then after awhile it gets very boring and frustrating. I did like the close up action and having to fight off an enemy thats right in your face. I bought this game after reading reviews saying how good it was,I perhaps was a little hasty. The brainjacking feature makes this game truly unique. Rent this game first,you will be glad you did. A moderately fun game.
3.0	Great gift Three Stars
3.0	"I'll list the problems.

- Does not make a big noticeable grip difference
- Hard to put on
- It's  easy to accidentally break your controller try to put it on.

Besides the fact it doesn't  make a noticeable improvement to your gaming or your grip on the controller it looks pretty cool. Good for looks, not much else."
3.0	Works pretty well, but the wired model is still better. Three Stars
3.0	"I think this game could be better if it would support a wheel and petal's controller like My Logitec  MoMo, but It only supports Key Board and Joy Stick which is good if You don't mind that, but after using Flat Out 2 ""a 32 bit game"" It's a disappointment. It supports 64 bit however as most newer systems run on now.  Key Board or Joystick < controllers only as far as I can find, so far."
3.0	I'm a PC gamer so it doesn't get touched much but I will admit I like it better than the PS4 so there is that. ... doesn't get touched much but I will admit I like it better than the PS4 so there is that
3.0	"You get to choose between the orange character and the pink character.  You move your character around munching on all the vegetable pirates.  You start out at level one, the more you eat the more levels you gain and the bigger you get.  You can hit the pirates that are at a higher level to break them up and eat them.  At the end of a level the character has a little talk with the elder,  poops out orbs, gets a score, and if you got all of the acorns he will give you a clothing item you can put on your character from the main screen.  The last thing on a level is a boss battle that might be a little tough, but not too bad.  There are acorns in the boss battle as well and after completing that you should get a legendary orb that looks like a poo emoji.  The next level will then open up.

The younger kids might have some trouble with it.  Some of the levels take a long time to get through and you have to know where you are going or what the objective is to finish it.  During a boss battle you have to know how to hit the boss.  From the levels I've played I remember a large grape that throws grapes at you and you have to hit the grapes to hit the boss.  Another boss you have to hit it and make it roll into a large spiky shell.

Some of the graphics are good like the opening story.  It's kind of annoying when the characters shake around so much when they are talking to each other in between levels, but not that big of a deal.

We rented it from gamefly a long time ago and I had to get it.  It's cute, pretty easy, and something different.  However, my kids barely played it.  I think my daughter played it the most and she only got past the first one or two levels before quitting.  It's 2018 at the moment, took it off the shelf to play it myself the other day, and all the save files were from 2014.  So it's mostly a game that sits on the shelf.  When Wii games were getting more play time they were more into Mario, Kirby, and Skylanders. The Munchables - cute and different"
3.0	This game is ok, perfect for my 7 year old, a bit challeging but not for older kids. Got it for $7 so it was a good buy. It's OK
3.0	It's not what we expected. Three Stars
3.0	I can usually play through a really good game at least twice before getting bored.  While the game is refreshingly different, it get tiresome very quickly.  I finished it but just barely. It gets old fast!
3.0	"I find The Sims 3 to be a bit of a let down.  The game play is alright once you get use to the changes, but there is just something miss that use to be there.  It feels a bit hollow to me, though I can't say that I'm really surprised given other Maxis game that had been watered down by EA (simcity come to mind to me, not that this is anywhere as bad as Simcity societies).

This game fear will not have the long term funny of The Sims 2, neither do I thing I will be that eager to buy add on down the line as with the last two.  Well at least I can always fall back on The Sims2.  I also found the Graphics and animation to be a bit of a down grade, even in there highest settings.

I can really see the potential that could have been a great game, but it seems to have fallen flat.  I just like they kill the games soul.  Well not sure if I can recommend this game or don't, it's not bad, but it just don't quite The Sims. a bit of a let down"
3.0	"First off - I do NOT play online, never have. I only play the game as it comes so cannot comment on co-op play, online gaming or the other host of playing options. For that reason this is probably not that a complete game review.

I have long been a fan of the Assassins creed franchise of games, own them all for PS3 and played them extensively. I began to get really fed up after the long anticipated AC3 came out; with it's endless cut scenes, and meandering play.
Unity looks bold and impressive, super cool graphics on the PS4, no question. But what has happened to the gameplay?
Patch on patch on patch gives you a mammoth install, and what follows is buggy, and again over the top with no skip cut scenes and (for want of a better word) crap.
I love the sandbox element, but it's a sandbox, not the Mojave!
I have to say as much as I love the game, it's gone in a direction I don't like.
It seems that they released almost a beta version of the game just to get it out for Christmas, and I have to be mean and give only 3 stars. I hope for those who use the online aspects, that those parts are not as bad. What happened to a great franchise?"
3.0	Good! Three Stars
3.0	I'd give this game a solid 3/5 stars. As a standalone game I'd rate it a tad higher, but it didn't amount to what everyone expected. The gameplay is fine for the most part. No wall jumping kinda sucks, and the dash to kill your enemies isn't that fun..... other than that. I'd still recommend this game if you want a new Megaman game. It's all your gonna get for now anyway. Just don't expect it to be groundbreaking or anything. Not bad, but didn't live up to the hype.
3.0	"I'm a long time doom fan, and this revival of the series was a real disappointment. The graphics are stunning, the guns are sweet, and the monsters are horrifying, but it all lost the unique ""doom"" feel.

The designers changed the gameplay type from gung-ho marine wiping demon scum from the world to ""please don't hurt me"" try to survive. This game focuses too much on the fear element that loses the novelty of a Doom game. It's set up so that theres less dodging and skill involved in playing the game, and more emphasis on knowing whats around the corner.

Don't get me wrong, there are things about this game I do like. I like the graphics, I like the storyline, but I feel that they should have tried to stick to their roots more. I'd have appreciated it a lot more if they returned some of the original monsters, or made an option to unlock original Doom 1 levels. Perhaps this game just has an impossible name to live up to and people are judging too harsh. A disappointment..."
3.0	"Well, these things are what they say they are - little nerf sports gear that you can use with the wiimote.

What may not be entirely clear from the photos is that these items are much smaller than their real world equivalents.  While this is certainly nice if you've got a bunch of people flailing around in your living room, it also means that you're still left with a pretty rough approximation of the actual activity.  The golf club, for example, will only reach to around my knees - the larger grip around the wiimote is nice, but I'm still not able to swing this as I would a real club.

Furthermore, it's a bit difficult to interchange and remove the attachments.  They snap together quite solidly, but  disassembly is a bit of a chore.  This fact is made more obvious due to the way the attachments hinder the ""mouse"" functionality of the wiimote - you must remove the attachment in order to point at the screen.

When all was said and done, we used these a few times and then shuffled them off to the side.  They're a neat idea, but they just don't add enough to the experience to justify using them regularly. Interesting diversion, but not really needed"
3.0	"I had great expectations on this game. I loved the original Flashpoint, but this just doesn't cut it.
I'll keep myself real short. This game is not a 5-star game like its predecesor, because:

1. It's just not as exciting as FP1. You don't feel as much in controll and your AI co-players are stupid. I don't know if its because of bugs but often they'll end up just about anywhere when given the orders to form different formations, and when they end up going in front of you into the killing fields and not taking cover and getting killed, well then it becomes annoying.

2. Your AI co-players will spot enemies 400 meters away while you will unlikely spot any farther away than 50 (unless your co-players hadn't spotted them first or the enemy fired at you, which they will long before you would have noticed them).

3. Its difficult. Alot of missions are hard for the sake of being hard. Often giving orders and using tactics doesnt make any difference. You might be placed 300 meters away from your enemy who is lined up behind fortifications with machineguns. Perhaps you can flank them but that would take like 20 minutes, and although realism is often positive it just becomes tedious keeping your forward-movement key pressed for that long while sitting back in your chair. Videogames are not real life and never will be.
Anyway, your only choice, (if you don't have art-support, which is awsome to watch) is to lie there and shoot back. If you don't want to lie there forever waiting for your teammates to use up all their ammo, you better start killing. In FP1 your teammates were good shots. Not here.

4. Lots of bugs.

5. Driving vehicles SUCK. you're locked at looking straight ahead and cant use the mouse to free-view! And the stearing is so sensitive that any sudden turn will make your vehicle spin. Didn't the creators test-play this game before it was released???

6. Shooting the assultrifles is boring and thats the kind of weapon you'll use most of the time. It's difficult to hit, and I guess thats positive (its not a shoot-em-up game) but if it was ""fun hard"" it wouldve been great! but its just hard, and boring. the enemy AI usually just stand around doing nothing, even when they fire and get fired upon.

7. All missions are timed which forces you to rush decisions instead of planning and playing safe, which I prefer. Very stressfull.

8. Sometimes checkpoints are too far between, and the reason I think people would want to have them closer together is not just because it takes time to replay, it's because its pretty BORING to replay alot of parts, which is basically why I give this game only 3 stars.

ps. Battlesounds are REALLY good. A disappointment"
3.0	Not a great game, but not so bad either. As a discount priced title, it's very playable-albeit a bit silly. But, if you love pirates, and have finished up assassins creed 4 and need a fix of salty dogs and swarthy swashbucklers, look no further! Plays like a classic RPG, decent graphics, and all the genre conventions one has come to expect from Western RPGs. It's no Dragon Age or Skyrim, but it has a story to tell and is entertaining. It's a solid 5 out of 10. There are fun moments to be sure. It can't compete with the witcher 3, but the middle of the Witcher 2 isn't all that much better. This a sleeper series and a game one can wrangle a decent time out of for sure. Back on the high seas!

3.0	Not as good of a game I thought it would be but its okay Three Stars
3.0	"Many people who hear ""Dante's Inferno"" and ""video game"" in the same sentence would probably assume a poorly put together, Hollywood-style rip-off that has little to do with the actual literary work.  Instead, ""Dante's Inferno"" (the game) does an excellent job of showing homage to the original material: we have a ""bonus material"" digital download of the ""Longfellow [translation of the] poem"" and the game world is an art-heavy graphic reproduction of the Hell depicted by Dante.  Unfortunately, this can also be like saying you're going to make ""Book of Revelation:  the Video Game"":  your source material is bizarre and disturbing, and you have to graphically paint what a reader heretofore could only imagine.

It's a tough task, but visually the developers of Dante's Inferno did well.  Throughout the game, every step of the way is fraught with horrid monsters, planes of torment, and the feel of a true struggle through hell.  Unfortunately, ""struggle"" is also a good way to describe the gameplay.  While the feel of the game is extremely similar to the God of War series, it misses out on a few of the more important elements that make God of War more appealing.  When you have the chance to do a ""finishing move"" on an enemy, you're given the choice to either ""Punish"" or ""Absolve"" them--either choice fills a kind of ""good/bad"" meter that will level up skills you buy in the Punish/Absolve skill trees. These power meters are more ornate than they are readable.  Quicktime events, the first time you hit them, aren't always clear as to exactly what you need to do.  I've adjusted the game's color settings, but the pink square and orange circle, when laid on a shining chrome background, isn't always easy to make out.  When you're in the midst of a frantic battle, having to take a moment to interpret the colors can mean the difference between ""win"" and ""reload...again"".

These are minor quibbles that simply add to your reload count, but then there are the bigger ones, such as first-time use instructions sometimes showing up right on cue, other times interrupting the heat of combat and freezing you, and still other times waiting until you've screwed up a few times to tell you that you were supposed to know about such-and-such button combination.  I don't need to have my hand held, but when I'm being given a new combination that's required for me to progress, I need to know about it when it is given to me and not some time later when everything else I knew to this point failed repeatedly.  I found levelling my skills unnerving because I worried that I might miss some sort of skill I was going to have to have later.

The graphics of Dante's Inferno are vivid and they are extremely detailed.  I've seen some reviewers mention ""constant"" nudity and/or sexual themes.  While not ""every ten seconds"" (as one reviewer suggests), at times it can certainly feel that way.  The original ""Inferno"" was written centuries ago and life was very different then--there certainly was no ESRB ratings system.  Lest you think the game is fraught with symbols or representative imagery, you should know that these depictions are very anatomically accurate and are often doing hideously unattractive and/or anatomically impossible things.  Dante's Inferno is 100% not appropriate for children and if you have kids, chances are you don't want them accidentally wandering into the room and it all coming out 20 years later in their therapy sessions.  We get some hint at this in the beginning, when our Christian Crusader is painfully sewing a cross into his flesh and spends some time slaughtering Kurds running at him with long knives, but that's the ""clean"" part of the game, before our descent even begins.

If you're looking for an interesting diversion from God of War, Dante's Inferno will please your eyes and chafe at your patience.  I truly wouldn't recommend paying a premium for this game, nor would I recommend it to someone new to this style of game:  while Dante's Inferno deserves credit for being artistically over-the-top, there are other games out there that are more fun to play.  The ""Punish/Absolve"" trick with the skill tree is different, but not in a way that I enjoyed.  I can't say whether having seen the animated video would have made the game more entertaining, but I can say that what I've seen of its look and feel in the cutscenes of the game don't give me that impression:  the somewhat cheap, gory 2D animation bears little resemblance to this game's eye-popping graphics. Infernal Labor of Love"
3.0	"Pretty cool game to pick up for $20-30 new. The bullet cam is great, and hopefully on future installments, you're given some control over it. Sort of like in Max Payne 3, how you can slow it down or speed it up.

Also, it would be fantastic if it didn't always cut to the X-ray view, and instead showed some crazy gore when you get a good shot. Currently, once you see the bullet enter in X-ray vision, you'll notice the actual character model has no damage once that animation is up. Again, to bring up Max Payne as an example, you got to see the bullet wounds hitting your target and the impact they made to the character models. Fun Game, Would Love Bullet Cam Options!"
3.0	confusing with the play mechanics. Three Stars
3.0	"I'm sure Q4 took a lot of work to make, but I find it a bit boring.  And I have a real nice machine.

Q4 isn't even as fun as Q3 or Q2, in my opinion.  It's just mostly running around or driving around shooting at stuff.

Well, you actually can't even run in Q4.  You can only move two way:  walk, or walk real slow.  The character you play is supposed to be a bad a**, but he can't move faster than a walk?

And the graphics are only decent.  Comparing the top 3 games, here is my order:

#1 - Half Life 2 (the best physics engine of all time)

#2 - Doom 3

#3 - Quake 4

Q4 isn't a bad game, but I want my money back. I'm not impressed"
3.0	"If you have ever played any of the Grand Theft Auto games on the Playstation 2, I'd probably recommend skipping this game.  It's plays exactly like the GTA series, but without the ""Mature (M)"" rating.  They've toned it down to get a ""Teen (T)"" rating, although it could've easily been spiced up for the Mature audience.

The gameplay is near identical to the GTA series; you have core missions that must be accomplished to ""beat"" the game, plus there are tons of little side missions that can be accomplished if you choose.  Also like GTA, there are hidden items that you find as you travel through the world; this is one aspect of the game that somewhat annoys me, inorder to find everyone of these little items you would basically need to buy the Game Guide, or have a walk-through tell you where each and every one is.  Too much hassle for me.

So, if you haven't play a GTA game yet, or you thought they were to violent for your kids (which they are), this is a great alternative, however it does have some violence, language and suggestive situations in it so pay attention to the ""Teen"" rating.  If you've played, and liked the GTA series, save your money, you'll most likely be bored with this title very quickly. New game or Grand Theft Auto Remake???"
3.0	"I was hoping for more, but it is an ok capcom fighter.  Nice seeing some of the old characters again.

Not the best balanced in characters, but still fun for a little while. Ok, capcom fighter"
3.0	"I  liked it when it was working, it has since quit working after my daughter pulled it out of the xbox. I might get another one eventually as i really did like it! i just wish it was a little more ""beefy""! Worked like a charm, sub-par construction"
3.0	"The game itself is a lot of fun if you're into matrix style jumping, sliding, walking on walls all while shooting your enemies.  If you're not, you likely won't enjoy this game at all.

When I think of this game I think of Kill Bill's Uma Thurman meets the Matrix's Neo.  That basically sums it all up.  It has a very Quentin Taratino feel to it, with the old style camera shooting, pulp fiction acting and of course the music.  For people like myself, it is a treat to experience all that unique quality in a video game.

You basically start off with samurai/gun slinger girl, who you can immediately identify as an assassin, who is trying to get back something of hers that was stolen in a shady deal that went wrong.  Without spoiling the story too much for you, you're more or less chasing around a guy trying to get a case back while killing dozens upon dozens of triad henchmen as they are flung at your like monkey poo.  There's high speed chases that require you to jump from car to car while shooting henchmen.  Obstacles that make you have to work at climbing walls whilst jumping from poles; and of course lots and lots of bloody gore as you both slide, jump and wall shoot your enemies or slice them apart with your sword.

The only thing that really killed me about the game was I found the controls to be a little jumpy.  Doing the simplest of tasks was sometimes impossible where as doing the impossible was easy.  You could wall climb, jump, jump, pole glide all while shooting enemies across three rooftops.  But getting up onto a crate so that you could jump to the balcony took 50 attempts.  It was almost painful at times.  This made the game still fun, but also very annoying.  Annoying to the point that there were times when I would put the controller down and consider just quitting for good.  Now normally a response like that to a game is typical and in the long run good.  Let's take Demon Soul's for example.  Two hours to get to a boss, just to make a mistake and have to start all over again.  Though you may go through two or three remotes, when you finish the game finally, you have this sense of accomplishment.  But spending 15 minutes trying to get onto a box or spending an hour of your night just doing the most mundane tasks, rewards no accomplishment.  It just keeps slapping you in the face that you could be spending this time playing other games.

The experience was overall satisfactory.  I loved the game style, the unique qualities that they brought from some of the best movies, and of course the main character.  However the minor deficiencies the game has did make it very frustrating and at times make me want to pack it in.  Have patience if you play the game and in the end you will enjoy it.  I would rate it 5 stars for fun, but 3.5 stars overall due to the problems mentioned above. Very intrigueing, fun with a twist but still lacking."
3.0	"I found this to be a fun open world 3DS game with lots of things to do and to unlock. I normally don't play LEGO video games, but this one really appealed to me because it gives the player a large city to explore, allowing you to play missions or just do whatever with the abilities you have unlocked. There are a lot of cars you can drive (including a UFO that hovers above the road), disguises for your character, and a story mode that uses humor to good effect. I don't own a WiiU and therefore haven't played that version, but I've read that the WiiU game is even better than this one, which should make it 5 stars instead of just 3.

I am giving this game only 3 stars because the missions are filled with a lot of the same repetitive gameplay actions. Many abilities require the player to simply find a specific object to interact with and then tap the A button until the task is completed. Also, combat in the game is rather repetitive and uninteresting after only a few battles. If the game had tried to enrich the gameplay more, I'm sure I would have given this game a full 5 stars.

So, if you are happy to simply have a game that's pretty relaxing and has a big city to wander around on your 3DS, I recommend this title. Load times are annoying (about 40 seconds each time you enter the load screen) but you can avoid this somewhat by simply staying in the city and exploring your current area instead of moving back and forth a lot among each section. Simple but fun game that kids should enjoy"
3.0	Actually leveled my main up to 79 and a half before realizing i wasn't having fun just sitting like a zombie going through the motions. Will say they at least included a storyline in this xpac but too little too late. Game has went down hill since it inception. BC was bad WOTLK is worse. Save some money and play some free trials (LOTRO, Warhammer and all SOE games offer them) and pick something worth your time. Finally Realized
3.0	"Story is compelling.
Art style and graphics are beautiful and amazing.
However, the game play seemed broken with the fact you have to use your Survivor instinct almost all the time, it gets annoying very quick One thumb up"
3.0	"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Matrix. I grew up on Philip K. Dick novels, and the whole Matrix concept is one I've always loved. I thought the movie's plot, characters and special effects were great. Also, I'm a big fan of Splinter Cell and played it many times. I've always loved the Bond style games where you work your way through a level, finding objectives and taking out the bad guys.

So while I really, really wanted to be blown away by Enter the Matrix, I just wasn't. It was a GOOD game, but not nearly as good as it should have been - not nearly as good as many other games that are out right now. I almost wonder if they rushed the game into production to match the timing of the movie, instead of finishing up some much-needed polishing.
First, the good parts. It was directed by the Wachowski brothers and features the quite talented actors and actresses from the movies. It really ties in to the movie and sort of 'immerses' you in the experience. So that is quite neat. They do have Matrix-time ""focus"", much like in Dead to Rights, where you can temporarily slow time and do cool moves. Just like in Dead to Rights, it seems cool at first and is hardly used in actual gameplay.
Gameplay is intriguing. You're given general objectives but then have to figure out how to get to them. So you're not exactly led by the nose. There are sometimes big rooms with lots of directions, lots of offices, lots of choices. Still, the game is about getting from Point A to Point B. I definitely miss Vice City's free-roam ability.
I was pretty disappointed by the graphics. There are many other games out right now with truly STELLAR graphics, and this isn't one of them. Objects vanish from the screen. The rendering just isn't very good, compared to other games we play quite a bit. The physics models are a bit bizarre. People slide like hockey pucks across the floor. You can leap on some things but not on others, apparently at random.
The sound has serious issues. My brand new CD right from the store started double-talking almost immediately in several scenes. Also, one of the hallmarks of a great game is that the sound is context sensitive - quiet and brooding at times, thundering at the exciting parts. But this game is ALWAYS thundering. It gets very monotonous after a while and completely destroys the atmosphere.
The load time is incredibly long, and many missions are incredibly short. There are times that you almost load longer than you get to play that mission area! With the instant-reheal-totally, the instant-restart-10-seconds-ago and the lack of challenging enemies to fight, most of the game is a cakewalk.
Add to that the quite annoying aspect that there are times that a door won't open until you kill all enemies in the room. So you go around and check the doors, but you have to slay everyone there before the ""special door"" will open up. Yes, some games use that technique. But this game in general is supposed to be a realistic adventure. In realistic adventures, doors don't sense when all enemies are dead and then spring open.
AI, one of THE most important parts of any game, is spotty at best. Sometimes the guards hide behind cover. Sometimes they stand in the open when cover is right next door. I've had cases where a guard stood pointing a gun at a door even though I was right behind him, pounding the stuffing out of 2 of his friends. He didn't even turn around until I bashed him in the head.
And finally, the camera is just plain annoying. Every friend I've had try this game says the same thing. They all play tons of adventure and action games. Somehow this game just does a bad job with positioning the camera anywhere useful.
The game really had a great deal of potential and I think with another month or two in QA testing it could have shone. But there are many, many areas that appear to have gotten through in a ""good enough"" state instead of a ""ready for prime time"" state.
Yes, I'll play the game. And yes, I'll see the movies many, many times and talk about them endlessly with my programmer / hacker friends. But I do feel let down that with all of the money and talent available to the Wachowski brothers, they didn't give this game the attention it merited. They focussed on the MOVIE aspect of the game, but not the GAME aspect. So Much Potential, So Many Issues"
3.0	It is OK the sound is fair nice Nice 7.1 headset
3.0	"G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA is a video game based upon the movie of the same name that is marketed as taking place after the movie. However, the storyline of the game actually has more of a lapover and the ending doesn't match up with the movie at all.  In the game you choose two G.I. Joe soldiers to fight with (or one each in co-op mode) as you battle your way through the Arctic, the desert, and a jungle to unravel what Cobra is doing and stop them from creating an ultimate weapon.  Along the way you can unlock battle files about characters and vehicles, rescue captured teammates that you can then later play, and short movie clips and PSAs from the 1980s G.I. JOE cartoons.  There are three levels of game play settings: casual, advanced, and hardcore. In casual a character doesn't die, in advanced they can die but regenerate at a checkpoint, and in hardcore they die and don't regenerate until after the end of a mission. Advanced is a good level to start out, but hardcore might be necessary for serious gamers.

The game play is pretty straight-forward and is reminded me of some old shoot-up games from the early 1990s, e.g. TEENAGE MUTANT TURTLES: THE ARCADE GAME.  The game is also a great 2-person co-op game. It's becoming more and more difficult to find a great 2-person co-op game.  Most games are either for one person play or are built around a multi-player online format.  There are very few good 2-person co-op games.  G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA is one of the better ones I have played in recent years.

The game does have some downsides.  The camera angles in the game are terrible.  Your Joe will be running around a corner and you can't see anything around the corner until about 5-10 seconds after they've already rounded the bend and sometimes by then you're under attack by a viscous enemy that almost leaves you dead. The path of the game is pretty easy to make out most of the time, but sometimes you'll follow a side path looking for an unlockable and end up getting stuck behind a rock or a tree.  Also, the best bonus characters (including all of the Cobra characters) aren't unlockable until either late in the game or until you've beaten the game.  The game is great fun playing once with a friend, but once you've beaten Cobra Commander towards the end and played the level using Cobra characters, there's really no joy or initiative to go back and replay the game.  It would have been nice to either have these characters unlocked earlier or to have two or three bonus levels than there are after the defeat of Cobra Commander.  Also, the final battle between Cobra Commander and G.I. Joe is really lame and not difficult at tall, just time-consuming.

Still, G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA is great fun for one-time play. It's also a wonderful 2-person co-op.  It's a video game that is far more entertaining and exciting than the movie it's based upon.  Recommended for fans of the movie and for those who enjoy old school 2-person co-op games. Better Than the Movie & Great Two-Person Co-Op Play!"
3.0	"First let's get the obvious out of the way.  This game is a shameless God of War ripoff.  Turning cranks while under attack, annoying flying imps, rotating bridges, button press minigames, very weak enemies that serve as fodder for your hack and slash attacks, orbs that lead to powering up your weapons, etc.  There's even an area where they blatantly had Typhon the Titan from GOW2 blowing wind at you in a cave.  If it was any worse it would border on copyright infringement.  However, I don't care how derivative a game is if it's good, so this is the last mention of those similarities.  BTW, I've never read Dante's Inferno so there will be no observations about how close this is to its source material.

Each circle of hell is themed with a different sin for which its inhabitants are being punished.  Unfortunately there are actually very few themed enemies in the game.  Most of your time is spent taking out standard undead soldiers and horned demons.  The stages themselves mostly feature black, nondescript backgrounds and very uninspired music.  The gluttony circle has mouths on everything, but most other levels were very drab.  The graphics are decent but look very unpolished, especially compared to other new PS3 games.  There's simply no attention to detail.  At no time did I ever feel nervous or like I was actually in hell.  The combat itself is really run of the mill, with individual scythe attacks having to be bought with the ""souls"" you collect.  Your projectile attacks stem from your cross, and I used those most of the game because at least they're a bit different from the standard fare.

Another issue in this game is the difficulty.  There were early times when it spiked as I was under siege from so many enemies, including some offscreen (how widescreen games in 2010 can have that issue is beyond me).  Most of the game I was able to use my powered up cross-themed projectile attacks to easily dispatch the waves of standard enemies from a distance.  A couple boss fights were frustrating as I tried to figure out what to do, while others were too easy.  I ended up beating the final boss on the first try, and that's always a very bad sign.

It's hard to believe that EA, the same company who made the bone-chilling Dead Space, could fail so spectacularly at setting the proper mood for this game.  The plot is razor thin, with Dante simply seeking to save the woman he betrayed.  There are some simplistic moments where his sins are brought up, but nothing that ever feels connected to the gameplay.  I always felt like I was simply dispatching foes to progress to the next bland area.  Cheap platforming deaths abound, with bad camera angles making it unclear where you need to land.  Then there was an area near the end which is icy (yes, ice in hell).  You have to walk slowly across an ice bridge, with sections shaking and breaking loose, dropping you to your death.  It was designed to make people throw their controllers in frustration, and is one more demonstration that people who hate gamers shouldn't be allowed to make games.

I never saw a single bug of any kind, and that's the most positive thing I can say about this game.  It only gets three stars because there was technically nothing wrong with it.  Without spoiling anything, they even had the nerve to directly hint at a sequel in the end.  This is a rental or bargain bin game at best, and even then only if you have nothing else to play first. I've been to the tenth circle: this tedious game"
3.0	It is a game for the Xbox One... I held my attention for a few hours. Three Stars
3.0	"This game is just, well, my title describes it. I would like to know exactly what these Croatians were on and where I can get some. Imagine your most bizarre dream (or drug trip) and combine it with Quake.
Yeah, Quake. This game really could have been made in 1996. Technically, it doesn't impress and could very well have been released as shareware.
But hey, it's cheap. I'd buy it just to see the guy with the pumpkin on his head and the chainsaw.
If you like ""Serious Sam"", also check out ""Will Rock"". INSANE!"
3.0	Not a WoW killer, but good graphics but good
3.0	"I will say that i do enjoy the games story, it is going without saying that this is thee worst Call Of Duty performance i have ever encountered on my PC.

Zombies and multiplayer are fine, holding a steady 60 fps but playing the story is a whole new nightmare.

During intense firefights, i will see the frame rates drop to a consent 10-25. When the battle is over, it's back to 50-60fps. Im at the end and i cant get through it due to all the low fps stutter.

how the developers can let this stay in this kind of performance is beyond me. But i will say again the multiplayer and zombies are solid.

I am running a i5-3470, gtx 970 with 16 gigs of ram. Zombies, Multiplayer good. Campaign performance is terrible."
3.0	The sound quality is superb but I cannot help but feel the device is overpriced. The capabilities the mixamp provides are incredibly unique, allowing me to receive audio from multiple devices at the same time in addition to broadcasting XBL party chat on my stream. Build quality is great, especially on the main dials which feel smooth and offer a nice resistance. My one big complaint is that when using party chat through the Xbox app for Windows my voice does echo at times which is frustrating. Despite all that the Mixamp Pro can do I believe the device is overpriced for what you get, especially since Astro once sold their current gen mixamps for $80 several years back, a price they now only offer for their older models. Build quality is great, especially on the main dials which feel smooth ...
3.0	It was alright but the buttons aren't switch based meaning they are lightly secured to a pcb board with a slab of rubber as the recoil mechanism to push the buttons back up. Inside, the gate for the joystick needed to be filed so I could hold down back diagonally reliably for Street Fighter V. Works best on pc with Xpadder or some keyboard to joystick mapper for compatability with most games. You get what you pay for. I recommend saving another $40 and getting the Qanba 360 stick for ~$80 instead. You get what you pay for.
3.0	regular Three Stars
3.0	this game is not nearly as good as nba 2k14 but for 20$ it is the best value for a basketball game on the xbox one bad game but good price
3.0	It is extremely satisfying to wield the proton pack.  The graphics in this game are incredible, and it is a lot of fun, but there are a few things that should have been improved.  My biggest problem with the game is that when you have the ghost-seeking goggles on, you can't shoot.  So, you need the goggles to find the ghosts, but then when you finally do, you are utterly defenseless until you remove the goggles by pressing Y, afterwhich it is already too late and the ghost has knocked you down or escaped. The training was also horrible in this game, and I am still confused about the grapple beam, and when to use it.  A lot of the time, it feels like you are doing absolutely no damage to the ghost, unless the other guys are aiming at the same ghost. There are also random prompts in the corner of the screen that have nothing to do with anything.  You will be trapping a ghost, and it will randomly prompt you to put the goggles on or something else that makes no sense, like press select. Could have been one of the greatest of all time
3.0	"I really liked this game from the start. If I had done a review after just a few hours of game play, I'd be tempted to give it 4 stars, but the AI is too week to make it compelling over time. I want to love it, but the initial 'this is a blast' feeling wears off about 7 hours into the game. I think its because the AI enemies have little variety in there attacks. So one tactic fits all.

It basically comes down to if the enemy swarms you with 3 or 4 units, you have to run away, until only 1 is chasing you. Then take out the 1st unit, go back to the camp and repeat. Taking out one at a time. This is the game tactic throughout for the most part, whether you play archer, mage,melee, or combo.

I do like the fact the monsters don't regenerate. About 5 hours in, it gets old facing packs of wolves. Some  groups of 4 will chase for about a scale mile of map. There isn't enough variety of monsters really. Technically, there are wolves, grey wolves, silver wolves, but in the end there all wolves. Just some are tougher than others. Same with grom and so on.

I like how you can stack multiple similar weapons to upgrade them and the magic system is nice. Tons of loot, but upgrading only works well if the AI is strong enough that you need upgrading. You really don't need to use the alchemy or too many skills to beat the AI. The AI is sluggish, a monster will often chase after you and then pause without striking. Allowing you to draw a bow right in its face and just keep doing quick draws and it will never hit you that way. The only thing that makes the AI tough at times, is by swarming you with 3 or 4 units. But a good AI has compelling one vs one engagements. That is what this game lacks most.

HORSES: I have yet to find a way to attack while on a horse, other than by bow and then only the first shot works, once the enemy swarms, being on foot is best. The horse is nice though just to relax and go for a ride on trails that have been cleared of monsters. It is also faster than foot. I believe it has 3 speeds, Just hit the W key once for slow, 2 for medium, 3 times for fast. Hitting the S key will drop the speed down 1 notch or stop the horse. The horse is also good for just blowing by wolves you don't want to fight. They cant catch you, and at some point you will get tired of seeing wolves in this game.

GRAPHICS: Decent and on par for 2007. The game is pretty, nice terrain, good models, not so good faces or animation.

PLUSES: -Amount of loot is impressive.
  -Spell system, simple and easy to manage boosters
  -Huge 32sq km game scale map is about 95% accessible. Only one town and some mountain ranges can't be navigated.
  -Fun hack and slash combat
  -No monster regen, so you get some quiet time to just hang out of ride a horse on cleared trails.
  -Lots of conveniant teleports

CONS: -All the different classes/builds don't really matter because except for very early, the AI is too easy.
  -Only 1 character type (Human Male)
  -While quests determine which factions you become popular with, has no real impact on main plot.
  -Managing all the loot is cumbersome. Plan on using several chests to store items.
  -While the map is huge, the terrain is almost identical most anywhere you travel.
  -You have to train before you can even add skill level 1 to certain spell branches, and finding the trainer is a pain.
  -Simple combat gets repetitive and old. A bit of a tease"
3.0	the game came fine, and it worked as well as it should. but one problem. it wouldn't hold a save file. and i tried to email the seller, but no response. that's right seller had no time for his customers. to be fair though, it was not really his fault that the game did not function fully, i found out later that these old gameboy color pokemon games hold a save as long as they have a running battery. so if you plan on buying a pokemon silver gold or crystal, you will also have to buy a nintendo screwdriver and a new CR2025 or CR2032 battery. so the product came as well as such an old game could come. but the main reason im not satisfied is because the seller in question did not respond to my emails. clearly has no time for his customers. warning.
3.0	Pretty cool. A little unrealistic because there is no way to heal, but it does make it challenging. Ok
3.0	Kid loves it Three Stars
3.0	It's a decent game for the most part. I didn't expect much from it. There's a few glitches here and there, the frame rate gets pretty choppy in the highspeed sections. The combat system is a bit clunky, but it's not too bad. I think the TV show is way better than the game. Don't Have Big Expectations For This Game.
3.0	"Almost perfect, but falls short in all around game.

Looks good
Easy to learn

Online is Good
A lot to do

Con's-
Gets a little hard as you progress
Way too many hard requirements
Old too fast

The game is still great, but after a few days the repetiveness and crazy things you have to do catches up. must rent game. If you like the hard stuff, this game is for you. Three point nine"
3.0	"I was quite surprised by the good reviews for this game. Overall, the game actually took a step back from Fight Night 2004.  My breakdown is as follows:

Graphics:  I paid $600 for a PS3 and expect high-definition graphics, but Fight Night has graphics I would expect on PS2, very disappointing.  There is nothing high definition about the graphics of this game.  The boxers are decent but the ring, the boxing venue and especially the crowd are awful.  The crowd is blurry and looks straight ahead although you may be on the other side of the ring and they repetitively do the same motion over and over regardless of what is happening in the fight.

Game Play:  The actual boxing is very similar to the last Fight Night (I agree with the ""if it ain't broke then don't fix it"" here).  However, the other parts of the game play have become worse.  In career mode, the options are very limited.  When you train, your boxer actually blocks a portion of the speed dummy so you cannot see what you are supposed to hit.  Also, there are no boxer rankings, rather a meter that tells you how popular you are.  Are you kidding me EA?  You randomly pick contracts (since there is no rankings you just pick randomly based on money).  This game is not very fun because there are no rankings and you have no idea how you are doing, who is the champion, or what you are ranked.  There is no pre or post fight commentary and no boxing magazine with articles.  Literally, you pick a random contract, train and then fight (over and over).  It gets boring and old after a while.  The only good thing about this game is the AI, the computer does figure out your boxing style and adjust.  The other bad part of this game is the store, there are not enough items and it costs $300,000 for a different color pair of shoes or trunks but you only make a few thousand dollars per fight.  You also have to pay for certain trainers but it doesn't help your boxing if you do.  In addition, they do not show the boxers walking into the venue as in the past, they miraculously about at the bottom of the ring.  There are only two winning celebrations and two reactions for knockdowns for your boxer.

Postiives:  The only good things about this game is the sound track (one of the best I have heard) and the AI.  Otherwise, go back to the drawing board with this one.

Recommendation:  No!  This title needs serious improvement.

EA Sports is 0 and 2 for PS3 games thus far.  What is going on?

And that is the word of D-Critique. DISAPPOINTING at best!!!"

3.0	"Okay I bought this with high hopes/ expectations typical with this series.  The results is a mixed bag but overall worth the purchase.

All review based on single player modes.

Pros
The story mode is compelling and finishing a stage generally treated you to some finely done cinemas, especially toward the end.

There's lots of extras scattered throughout each stage, some hidden well and others out in the open.  It begs for exploring.

The Skirmish mode is fun and can be challenging on the highest difficulty.

Playing the Convenent in Skirmish is like playing GOD mode.  Having multiple shields on your Convenent bases is very nasty.  Having two Scarabs is the ultimate case maker.  Giggle away as the UNSC sends thousands of troops to thier deaths.

Cons
The story mode is short and unlike other RTS games, you won't play the enemy side and see thier side of the story.  I even felt that the flood should have had some stages of thier own.  It doesn't seem like it would have been that hard for them to dream up a stage and put some challenges in it.  There didn't have to be cinema's with every stage and like the other RTS's something could have happened to cause the ultimate 'loss'.

The Skirmish Mode is horribly unbalanced.  I played for a month trying for 100% difficulty as UNSC (humans) and could only reach mid 80's.  On a whim one day I played Covenent and stomped the yard.  I had no difficulty making 100% difficulty and only use the one 'leader' unit to make this happen.

Skirmish base building is also very unbalanced.  For the human's starting base (at high difficulty level), I have to build two reactors, one of those needs to be upgraded, one field armory and a barracks (or vehicle depot) to the covenents one temple which is the all in one wonder.  4 UNSC base units versus 1 Covenent base unit!  I didn't include the Convenent Hall (barracks) or Foundry (depot) because the temple 'all in one wonder' pops out a leader automatically who can smack down much anything by himself.  At full strength (by researching things in this same temple) I've had him take on fields of tanks with nary a scratch to his shielding!

The 'every unit has an opposite unit' thing is crap.  I get 10 scorpion tanks on the field and nothing can stop me.  NOTHING.  Its just like StarCraft and the easy tank victories with it.  Even the Hunters, with thier very impressive plasma beams, which are supposed to be the Convenent vehicle killers, whimper and die by the thousands, crushed under my metal treads.  Convenent bases crumple like egg shells and retialation forces are mere gnats in the wind.

There is annoying things about the main menus.  When you go to Skirmish mode (which I play the most), the 'random' option doesn't really randomize very well at all.  Most of the time its the same over and over again.  The game always defaults with you playing the same side and the same guy, there isn't anything that keeps the options you choose so you have to set up a game every freaking time.  Also skirmish mode doesn't give you an option like 5 against you, which is super fun in Warcraft RTS, or 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1, another fun mode.

All together I got a lot of cons listed here, but I still enjoy the game, they did good with it and its canon now so get used to it kids :)  Perhaps downloads in the future will help elevate its class and style?

Mmmm....back to Fallout 3 I go.... Not the genre redefiner I was hoping for"
3.0	Three stars because it's kiss man. It's kiss . Kiss kiss kiss. -2 stars because it's an old computer game. Old old old old old. Doesn't work very well. But it's Kafkas. If you collect kiss stuff you want one. Keep the box and make sure it's prristine condition. If not return it and ask for a pristine one.  You can probably open it and play it, but it's not much fun. Other than the nostalgia factor to feel like it's 1997. But its  KISS ! ( Only downside is I do hate to give Gene Simmons anymore of my money after how he treated Ace and Peter ) not great But its KISS!
3.0	"Cartridge had a busted chip mount; Game chipset was loose. Not a hard fix but I can't imagine it occured during shipment.

Other than that, game works great. Quick shipment. game works great. Quick shipment"
3.0	My monitor has a couple of pixels out strait out of the box.  Probably could be packaged better.  Also the power cord is too short.  Works great otherwise.  It arrived in timely manner.  Price was no better or worse than any were else though I could not actually find one any were available so that was a plus. monitor issue
3.0	"Excellent and great looking controller overall but.......  The clear plastic on this controller and many other Xbox controllers is too brittle around the battery compartment and often cracks.  Though I treated this controller with care, the battery compartment cracked due to normal pressure if the battery pack.  I am not sure if this may be due to the battery packs putting too much pressure on the controller but only two of my many Xbox 360 controllers cracked like this and this was one that did. This may not be fair to ding this specific controller for a flaw that may be common to all Xbox 360 controlers but MS needs to be criticized for one of the very few flaws of the 360 design.

- DPad is mush
- Battery pack can crack due to brittle plastic and pressure on the pack.

But if you are just looking for a very good looking controller with the superior d-pad, this may work out well.  I would advice against using any battery packs (just use rechargeable batteries and the pack that comes with it). and you may find it will last a long time with no issues. And it is a nice looking controller with nice blue glow. Excellent controller overall but"
3.0	Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness is not as bad as they say but has got the be the weakest of all Lara Croft games. It is a good action adventure game but with big problems. The bad controls and odd camera angles are the major ones. The controls are quite different from the other games and will take some time to get used to. Lara has some new moves like punch and kick but they are useless because of the ugly controls. They do not cause much damage either. The AI is very bad. The enemies do not notice you when in stealth mode and it is better to use stealth than combat. The weapons are bad too, no pistols with unlimited ammo. The enemies also drop few ammo when killed. Lots of puzzles but easy compared to the others. We also get to play a new charecter Kurtis Trent in a couple of levels. Controls are the same but he is a total waste. There is not much about him, he has no story too. His boss level is the most frustrating level in the game. It will take you hours to get past and what happens after that is enough to drive you crazy. Graphics are far better. Lara is better detailed here. The story is quite good. Verner has been murdered and Lara has been framed for it and she is on the run, she must find out who did it and why. Except for two boss levels, the levels are well desinged. Tomb Raider VI is not a bad game, it is the controls and the camera angles that make it unplayable. Tomb Raider : The Angel of Darkness
3.0	this is a good tetris like game. I liked it enough but I bought it for my sister, who was a huge fan back when we were kids good time killer
3.0	Nice Three Stars
3.0	"This could be an interesting game if it had more options. There is no way to reset the screen or minimize it so I can put it in the background while taking a break . Everything is taken over by the full screen, including my clock, weather, etc. plus there is no way to pause it when I want to open another program. I have to exit and thereby lose all my points and progress unless I finish a level, which can take some time if playing in the ""untimed mode"". I like to play a half an hour or so in the morning while I have my coffee, but I never get to the point where anything was saved. I have to restart from the very beginning every time I start the game back up. Very tiring. I prefer a game like ""Around the World in 80 Days"" or the ""Atlantis"" games where I have the option to save my progress when exiting if I need my computer for something else. It seems the only options for this game are chosing a different cursor or adjusting the sound levels.
The graphics are very nice, big and bold. The moving screen is a twist from the traditional 3-match games but it gets tiring very qyickly. Discovering the items is kind of fun in the beginning but then starts to get boring as it's more or less the same over and over. Not much of a challenge but I guess it all depends what your taste in 3-match games is. If you like to try something new, go ahead and try the download. It's cheap enough on Amazon and worth a try. Game gets boring quickly!"
3.0	My son tried it and found that it was a co-op game & if you don't like those types of games like my son doesn't then this game is not 4 you. Not 4 a single player person.
3.0	"In this game, you take control of a cop called Leon Scott Kennedy, who is in his first day of job; and a woman named Claire Redfield looking for her brother Chris Redfield (one of the main character of the original game). Unfortunately, they're both unlucky. The whole Raccoon City is infected by a new virus, who turn people into zombies, dogs into monstruous creatures, and other horrendous monsters. Considered by many the best Resident Evil charpter ever, it's finally on the Nintendo GameCube... Let's check out what's it all about:
- Graphics: Ok, this is the worse part in here, but it's not that bad. Do you notice any differences in this graphics and PSOne's, talking about this game? Yes, you do.. But it's not a big difference, not a thing to notice at first. In the GameCube version, the characters' and monsters' faces can be seen clearly, unlike in the PSOne versions. Background is the same as PSOne's. So, if you were expecting a graphic evolution like from PSOne's Resident Evil to GameCube's, then I'm sorry.. You'll be disappointed in the graphical part.
- Sound: There is not a difference between this version and PSOne's if you're talking about sound. Sometimes the music can be too loud when characters are speaking, so you won't understand wha they're saying. But that's no problem. Just ajust the sound effects and you're done. The soundtrack is scary and classical, voice acting is not bad either.
- Fun: It's such a great thing to play this fine Resident Evil charpter with the awesome GameCube controller. It feels like a new game. Even though I've played (and beaten) this game before in the PSOne, I must say that I was still scared of those weird corridors with that scary soundtrack. The game story is really good. Overall, this game is really fun if you're a Resident Evil fan. You have to beat the game twice with every character, because both have 2 scenarios, and you will not know the whole story if you don't finnish the game's four scenaries. Plus there are three mini-games. One of them is called Extreme Battle. In this one, you'll have to take and plant bombs all around the RPD, but time is limited so you have to hurry. This game can be played with many characters, incluiding Chris Redfield. Another one is called Hunk - The 4th Survivor. In this mini-game, you must get to the helicopter room, so they will rescue you (you are Hunk, the only one who survived trying to take the G-Virus from William Birkin), but it's not that easily because they have really few items and lots of zombies. The other mode is almost the same thing, except that the difficulty is extreme and you play as To-Fu (a cheese, yes), and the mini-game is called Tofu- The Survivor. Still, it's far from being my favorite Resident Evil charpter.
- Educative: Ok, this game is not educative, not at all.. Lots of blood, violence, body parts falling down zombies, heads cut off and all this kind of thing, that you'll see in nearly every Resident Evil game. But there is no cussing in this game. So, parents... you should only buy this game if your children have played this kind of games before and if they do not get scared easily, unless they'll have nightmares, lots of 'em...
The veredict: Resident Evil 2 i very cool game, it's in the Top 10 of the Best PSOne Games Ever. So it can't be bad... If you've played Resident Evil 2 before and you own an authentic copy for another plataform (PSOne, Dreamcast, Nintendo64 or PC), I don't think you should buy this game unless you want the whole series in the GameCube console (which is my case, because I bought the GameCube to play the whole Resident Evil series in it). If you've never played it or if you do not own this game for other plataform, it is a must-buy. One of the best Survival Horror games ever. In this game, if the suspense doesn't kill you... something else will. A fine port"
3.0	The hardware was very nice. More hard ware Wii.
3.0	OK game; more for a teen than a kid. Teen hero game
3.0	so maybe this is jsut because I outgrew teh pokemon rangers series, but it ididn't seem to be as fun as hwen i plaeyd pokemon ranger shadows of almia Didn't like it as much as shadows of almia,
3.0	"The left control stick wore out in like 2 months...

But I guess they make them like that so I keep on spending 45-60 on a controller again and again and again and again.
Freaking gaming companies and their controllers. This is the oldest trick in the book. Meh, wore out pretty quick."
3.0	"Updated 3-21-13: The original Civ 5 was really buggy, and later in the game, it would hang just from zooming the screen in and out.  I thought this was fixed with this updated version, but I just had another such hang this evening.  The game is still buggy.  And, this is on my brand new system which is very up to date with software and gear.  The problem is in the game, not the computer, as NOTHING else I play hangs, ever.

If you've read my review of the original Civ 5 it was not very glowing.  It was missing something, and much of what it was missing was added with this first official add-on for the game.  It adds religion which certainly adds another dimension to the game (something that prior versions of Civ had, but the authors dropped from Civ 5.)  It also brings back espionage, which is pretty cool.  Now you can have spies that can do all sorts of things from rigging elections in City-States, to seeing what the competition has as regards technology that you can learn they have and may even be able to steal it.  Of course, that brings counter-espionage, and so you have to build structures to protect each and every city from spies.  In addition, the add-on adds several civilizations that really were needed to flesh out playing possibilities, (as well as several more city-states).

I think all these things really begin to make this now a superior product over Civ 4, which many people I know had chosen to stay with due to the not-so-good reviews on Civ 5.

I've only run into two problems that now happen with the add-on in place, that did not happen before.  One is that sometimes when you move a unit, the game will freeze, with the unit moved, but the circle that shows where it moved from stays on the screen.  It appears the game is deciding something, but what, I cannot know.

The other problem is that when you click on next turn, the game will stop and you will usually think it's just ""thinking"" while it's doing the other moves for the rest of the civilizations on the map.  But then you will notice that it found another unit (or more) that still has to be moved.  The only indication is the message that appears in one small window, indicating you need to take action.  I think if they added a sound clue to alert you that you aren't done yet, that would resolve the issue.  Either that, or make the message blink to draw your eye to it.

All in all, I love the game even better now though with these additions.

Oh, I want to add more more comment... this product is serviced by STEAM, an on-line service that assists you with patches automatically, as well as gives you all sorts of information about this game as well as related games.  I really hated having to use STEAM in the beginning as the original Civ 5 was my first game managed by them.  What's my point?  It is that when I loaded the CD I got from Amazon, it seamlessly loaded the software, with no indication of ANY issues with STEAM.  Then when I went to play the new game, STEAM already automatically noticed my upgrade, and it all worked flawlessly.  This is the way an installation SHOULD work.  It's obvious that the game manufacturer verified their installation process in such a way that there were zero issues with the STEAM interface.  (This is NOT always the case with some other game manufacturers that have contracted with STEAM for support purposes)  Bottom line: This case was a 5 star rating because it worked perfectly and silently.  That is, it was GREAT! This is a MUCH improved add-on for the original CIV 5 - updated"
3.0	it works Three Stars
3.0	"Starcraft II is a good game, but does it live up to its predecessor?

Comared to the original Starcraft and Brood War, Starcraft II's single player gameplay is more interactive and has additional features such as upgrades, not-completely-linear mission progression, and achievments. However, the storyline is not nearly as complex as SC and BW, which can be seen as a good or bad thing depending on one's taste.

The 1v1 gameplay is very intense. There is no ""down-time"". In order to be the best, you have to constantly be building, upgrading, expanding, scouting, etc... The continuous thinking and clicking can be too much. 1v1 is NOT for casual gamers! Team play can take some of the pressure off, but it can be annoying when your teammates refuse to attack with you or help you defend.

Starcarft II requires a lot of time to be spent inside of one's base, building tons of buildings, purchasing upgrades, training loads of harvesters etc... In other words, it is a MACRO-based game.

An optimal base needs 30 workers. So if you have two expansions running at full capacity, plus your original base, that's 90 workers. Compare that to Warcraft 3, where you might only need about twelve for your first base, and five for any additional bases.

Starcraft II is not very micro-intensive. The combat is so fast paced that by the time you can click the unit to run it away from attack, it is dead.

The custom maps are my favorite part of Starcraft 2. However, the system for hosting or joining online custom games is terrible compared to Starcraft and Warcraft 3. In Warcraft 3 you can host a game and have it appear first on the list, for a few seconds, until it is replaced by more a recently hosted games. This gave every map a chance to be played. You could also give your game a title when you hosted it.

In Starcraft II, you click on ""Join a Game"" and you are presented with a list of the most popular maps. If a map is not popular, it probably will never be popular, because no one will ever see it unless they scroll through several pages of popular maps. And if they do finally find the less popular map and join the game, no one else will join, so it will never rise in popularity.

There is hope, though, for new maps. The other way to view the map list while joining a custom game is by ""Newest"". You will see all the most recently published maps. However, if a map doesn't become popular right away, it is screwed.

This concludes my review of Starcraft II. I hope you found it helpful.

P.S. I can't wait until the first Starcraft II third-person-shooter comes out. Then I can finally say ""Hell, it's about time!"" Starcraft II - Core Game is Fun - Some Disappointment"
3.0	The few items you get could have been included in some other bundle. What is in there is quite fun to use, and helps your sims mood, and romance. I bought it for the hot tubs. Could have been better deal
3.0	Kid enjoys it Three Stars
3.0	Strong average game personally it's keeps me from getting bored but I never come home looking forward to play my opinion personally do not like such slow paced games. Average Game
3.0	It feels cheap, and the base keeps falling off. It is also easily knocked over. It is also easily knocked over
3.0	It kind of feels weird on the hand.  Hand feels like it's going to slip right off.  Besides that the response is very nice. Hand feels like it's going to slip right off
3.0	"Let me start by saying I love the movies...well the first two movies.  The third is just not as good.  But we're here to discuss the PS1 game based on the first movie, not the third movie.  To put it simply, the game is like a watered down Tomb Raider.  Now we go into the more detailed review.  First, the graphics aren't very good.  The PlayStation is certainly capable of better.  But then, this game was made back in the nineties, so I won't hold the graphics against it too much. Also, the actors did not come back to voice their characters.

Next, the game play.  Rick has tank like controls, where moving up on the control stick moves him forward, left and right moves him in those directions, and down makes him walk backwards.  While this is awkward at first, especially in the narrow areas of the game, it's nothing you can't get used to, and when you do, you'll be gliding through even the narrowest sections like a pro.  The controls are okay, but if you don't like them, you have the option to adjust them.  The issue is that the custom control scheme doesn't save, so you must rework the controls every time you play, but it is only a minor gripe.

Rick is able to jump, attack, block, sprint, cycle his weapons (more on those later), interact with objects, put away/take out his weapons, look around, and spin around one hundred eighty degrees.  Given the games tank controls, the ability to turn around quickly is good to have.  Its a good tool if you gotta make a hasty retreat from a fight.

Now, the game does have a good selection of weapons.  Here's a brief breakdown of said weapons.

Fists: Punching doesn't do much damage, but it does fast damage and works on the weaker enemies.  But stronger enemies will shrug this off.

Duel Pistols: Have good firing rate and range, but are not as strong as the other guns.  Good for picking off weaker enemies at a distance, especially when you're cornered.

Machete: A weapon that is only for close quarters combat.  Stronger than the fists, and doesn't take ammo, so you don't need to rely on punching (unless you want to)

Shotgun: A strong weapon, but does not have a long range.  Good for dealing with enemies that are in your face.

Machine Gun: Arguably the best gun in the game.  Good range, powerful, and fast firing rate.  A good crowd control weapon when you're outnumbered and cornered.

Dynamite: A thrown explosive that does a lot of damage, but it can also hurt Rick, so don't be in the blast radius.

Torch: Not so much a weapon as it is a tool.  The torch can be lit by open flames to illuminate dark areas and activate Ra panels, which give Rick an extra life for every eight that he activates.  However, the torch only stays lit for twenty seconds, so don't lollygag.  The torch can be used as a weapon, which is good, because swapping weapons makes Rick put the torch out, so allowing you to hit enemies with it, even while lit, was a smart move on Konamis part.

Amulets: A magical version of the Dynamite, a thrown explosive that is powerful.  Dont waste them, as some enemies can only be killed with magical weapons.

Golden Sword: A mystical weapon, no more powerful than the Machete but does kill magical enemies very handily.

The guns are useful, and there is ammo lying around, but personally it is better to hold off on using guns and reserve them for the trickier fights.  Along the way, Rick must collect golden keys to progress through the levels, each key switch *activated by finding the key* marking the end of a zone.  Some levels have more than others.  Also, there are Perfect Zone Gems that are used to unlock bonuses, like cheats and a secret level.  The gems are collected by killing all enemies, breaking all jars, collecting all objects (artifacts, ammo, and health) and by activating all Ra tiles.  If the key is collected before this goal is met, the gem cannot be obtained, but levels can be replayed to gather the missed gems.

The game does have some flaws, such as the slippery jumping.  I over shot a jump on multiple occasions, usually leading to a death.  I have accidentally walked off ledges, also leading to death, and sometimes the game glitches, for example I once fell through a bridge and died.  However, despite the occasional glitch induced death, the game is not broken, and these glitches are rare.

So what is the final verdict? Well, if you are looking for a PlayStation classic that is challenging and rewarding, you're not going to get it.  But there are worse games in the PlayStations library, and there is some fun to be had here.  Who can this game be recommended to? Well, if you liked the movie and have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket, are some PlayStation Completionist who must get their grubby mitts on as many PS games as possible, or had this game as a kid and want to rebuild your childhood PlayStation collection, I say go for it.

Overall, its not awful, but not great.  Its not going to amaze you, but you shouldnt be too disappointed.  In my opinion, five bucks or less is a reasonable price, anything between five and ten would be pushing it, and anything over ten bucks is too high.  Just don't expect Tomb Raider quality. There are worse games to spend money on."
3.0	Unity, would be a five star game if it wasn't for all of the bugs. I recently brought this game for like $8 and to be honest I am glad I didn't pay more. The story is really good, so is the level of customization, the graphics looks beautiful  (better than Syndicate). The controls take some time to get used to. The co-op mission is a nice addition (even though I am solo gamer for the most part). They should release this in an updated version with all the bugs fixed. Could have been five stars
3.0	"I paid a little less than 6 dollars for this camera. It does not have Sony's name on it as described. BUT it does work perfectly well. It is my very first camera. I bought it so that I can play the Just Dance games. It seems to work fine. All the commands are being met and it is good quality. The reason I didn't give it 5 out of 5 is because, 1. The item came with nothing at all. No instructions (although it was simple to use) no installation discs. Nothing. 2. It came in a box that made the whole thing look used, as if I bought a second hand product. I have to say though, that this thing didn't look used. But the box it came it made the whole thing look used. and 3. It was advertised as being Sony, and it isn't.
I do not plan on returning it because it is serving its purpose and I am having a great time using it. Does What I Needed It To Do"
3.0	"this game 'feels' a lot like an older and very good game called Darkstone, which came out in between Diablo and Diablo2 and was in a 3D environment,lets you change camera angles, download different skins for your character, etc... probably in the bargin bins if you want to try it.
anyway, DS's character models are rendered nicely (you can choose from different faces, bodies, tec) but it's really the environments that stands out; outdoors can snowing, have fog, etc. in the dungeon you can light the torches and look for levers on the wall -- all done with enough detail so it's not distracting from the gameplay but very discernable.
the game seems mostly bug free and the pathing AI is ok. aiming isn't the best especially since the screen centers on the character (you have have up to 8 in a party) you have selected -- the screen jumps a bit when you want to micro manage a big confrontation. you can set different reactions like an abbrevated version of Baldur's Gate's combat scripting.
the advancement of skill level and attribute is strictly tied into how you use your character(s). have someone always use a bow and their dex and ranged skill level will advance quicker. use prodominently spells (there are 2 schools, nature and combat magic that you can choose between) and the intelligence and magic (nature or combat) levels will advance faster. so there are no points you need to manually distribute once a character gains enough experience.
the plot itself is very linear (not necessarily a bad thing) with some subplots and very little in puzzle solving (up to chapter four where i am at the moment)...
all in all a good game... i know that 3 stars looks low but excepting for the multi-character party, if you've played Darkstone, you'd probably see this as a progressively better game but not revoluntionary nor a big leap over Diablo2. good dungeon crawl"
3.0	Great Product Great Seller Three Stars
3.0	"This game is very exciting.  Almost like you are taken back in time to their era.  The graphics are really some of the best I've seen.  The tasks are smart and ""deadly"".  You really have to think during this game in order to survive.  You'll find yourself playing this and trying to master it to get to other levels.  My son loves it.  This is not the type game he is usually drawn to, but this one does it for him.  Yeah, you'll feel like an Assassin Exciting and engaging"
3.0	I've been a long-time fan of RTS and RT tactics game designs and was pleased to get WIC. I've admired MASSIVE's approach to this genre through both Ground Control and GC2. Visually, this game is quite appealing but the problem is its overly frenetic pace. It is fully scalable so one can pull back to a global map or drill down to an individual unit. This was always the lure with GC and GC2 because the game was very exciting down close (the explosions, tanks rumbling, etc). The problem with WIC is the pace is so fast and so much is going on simultaneously that you almost always have to stay in the pulled back (global) view and that pretty much squashes the fun factor of an otherwise descent game. I would rather have it slowed down and bit and hoof it through the woods with an infantry squad once in a while. A Pretty Good Game BUT...
3.0	"Wario Land shake it is a 2d platformer released back on the original wii in 2008 and is the 5th (or 6 if you count the ds one) in the Wario land series. I'm a huge fan of the original Wario land games expecilly the 1st on back on the original gameboy. I would say behind the Mario and sonic games there some of the best platformers ever made.

Shake it however just feels a little off for some reason. Theirs only a few enemy types, half of them can't even hurt you besides just getting in the way a little bit. The levels are designed well for exploration but theirs not many obstacles/pitfalls to stop you.  I believe its more or less aimed more towards younger gamers compared to the other Wario land games because it is really easy to beat the game. Now getting all the collectibles in this game is a different story as in all the Wario games its very challenging to get some of them and it will take moderate skill to 100% the game. Theres also a few wii remote functions you have to do like shaking treasure bags and throwing stuff to hit a object. It feels kinda gimicky but it could have been a lot worse so its not enough to hurt the game.

I will give this game some credit for the graphics. Its almost like playing a Saturday morning cartoon and I wish the would bring this style to make a 2d Mario or to bring it back on the next Wario land game whatever platform it may be. The only problem with the graphics is that during most of the game there's a large useless bar on both sides of the screen that pretty much restricts widescreen play with this game. The music isn't bad not the best I've heard from a Nintendo game but its not the worst either. There is a few good tracks here and there though. That's really all to say about the sound other than the occasional WARRRIOOOOOO sounds

In general I would say compared to other 2d or 3d platformers on the system (new mario bros, dk country returns) this one is a little bit of a step down but it is more relaxing so if you have played a lot of new Mario bros and dk country on the Wii and want something a little less stressful, if you want a game for your kids or a younger gamer  then I would recommend it if you can get it cheap. However if you have a gameboy I would recommend playing the 1st 4 Wario land games as I found them to be a lot more fun. not the greatest game ever but its ok"
3.0	"SquareEnix(formerly SquareSoft)  was often the leader in creating top of the line role-playing games.  Not only were a majority of the games beautiful in their graphics,  but the music and plot were superior to most other games in the genre.  While Square still does well in the graphics department, all other aspects have dropped off considerably.

  The original talent that made so many of the early Final Fantasies left after FFX and formed there own company.(There new company made Lost Odyssey for the Xbox360)  The plot in FF12 is erratic to put it nicely.  While the start of the game has a promising introduction, the plot takes a vacation about 5 hours into the game.  For the remaining majority of the game you will be wandering around doing a lot of fighting and searching with very little plot advancement.  While the plot does pick up again in the last 5 hours or so it is still very poorly developed.

  Perhaps the weakness in the plot would have been less noticeable if the character development had been better.  To be honest,  I never grew to care about the characters in the 60+ hours I slogged threw the game.  FFX didn't have the best plot either but the character development was top notch.  You definitely cared about Yuna and Tidus.

  I know many others have complained about the battle system but I didn't find it that bad.  I liked how the gambits could speed the game up, yet you could turn them off if you wanted more control in the battle.  The main complaint I have is the lack of different enemies.  The game rewards you by dropping better loot if you kill the same type of enemy over and over.  Since selling loot is the best way to get the hard to get gil in this game, you will be constantly killing the same enemies to get the chain reactions.  I will admit, killing 50 wolves in a row is rather boring.

  FF games are usually known for the decent variety of side quests they offer.  FF12 has a huge monster hunting side quest game.  You can read posts on bulletin boards and then you find the petitioner who tells you the monster they need killed.  This is a fairly decent diversion, unfortunately some of them are so difficult that you need a strategy guide to tell you how to find the mark.  I did enjoy the past FF card games and even Blitzball in FF10 more so than this.

  One last thing before I break down individual scores for the game.  Either get the Prima guide for this game or check out the FAQ sections on gamefaqs for help.  In order to get the best weapon in the game you can't open certain treasure chests in the game.( whoever came up with this idea should be banned from making games)

  While FF12 is a decent game,  it is far from perfect.  In many ways I believe the series is heading in the wrong direction.

Graphics:  10/10  For a Ps2 game they are top notch
Sound:  7/10  Decent music but not as good as other FF games
Story:  5/10  Starts well, but has huge pacing issues.  Little character development
Fun Factor  6/10  Battles are fun but repetitive.  Didn't have same charm as past FF games.
Replay Val  3/10  Perhaps if you didn't hunt many monsters the first time you played.

Overall:  6/10  Not a bad game, but I find it hard to believe most ""pro"" critics gave it perfect or near perfect scores.  I wonder if it didn't have Final Fantasy on the title if it would have received the same praise?  For those that love Role-playing games I say rent it to see if its your cup of tea.  The ps2 has many games in this genre.  To me, FF12 is somewhere in the middle of the pack. I just killed 50 wolves in a row.  How exciting"
3.0	I personally don't like this controller cuz i have big hands, but almost everyone i know loves it. I am used to the big controller, so when i got the small controller i just let my friends or brother use it. This review applies to the Japanese version but I think the only real difference is the color. For kids
3.0	"This is precisely the sort of sequel expected from the Red Alert franchise.

First I should say that I read early regarding development, and heard that the game would ""play up the silliness"" in design.

That immediately turned me off from it, as Red Alert was so blunt, unpolished, bleak, and gritty as to be a frightening game for its time with the mix of a shockingly realistic Joseph Stalin in cutscenes, and a seemingly brutal AI in a game that never allowed for cheating or difficulty adjustment beyond that at the start of the campaign.

Red Alert 2, in comparison, upped the ""silliness"" to a point of complete cheeseballs, and was a huge disappointment to many fans.

At the very least, stupid cartoonyness aside, I thought Red Alert 2 was great.

And so Red Alert 3 manages not to go overboard with playing up the ""silliness"", but it does come off as a cartoony sort of game in Red Alert 2 style.  The video cutscenes are of course sharp and beautifully acted, and while at first I was disappointed in the choice of well-known actors (Tim Curry in particular), I've found that they produce some of the best characters for the game.

Tim Curry is the first believable Russian Premier of the series, holding little of the terrifying dread of Joseph Stalin, or the Russian-style ""engrish"" and goofball antics of Alexei Romanov in Red Alert 2, but making his own Russian Premier, a clear-cut and defined character who could be a legitimately real person.  George Takei has clear authority and gravitas as the Emperor, and his grand declaration on the Russians of Japan's divine mandate to conquer is overwhelming.

The gameplay itself is nothing really special, something much of the same sorts as seen in Command and Conquer Generals (I haven't played C&C 3 so I can't judge there), with a vast improvement in graphics since Generals, but still a sense of slower-moving action (not just from graphics overload).

The gameplay as well is very much a balanced sort of cartoonishness which at one moment even managed to convince me that it was normal to see Russian conscripts marching alongside a trained scout bear and a series of tanks that walk like spiders (Soviet Stingrays) to attack Japanese samurai with lightsaber-like swords.

While the game itself is terribly average, and barely an improvement from Command & Conquer: Generals, the mere presentation of it---the menu design, the epic soundtrack by Frank Klepacki, the cutscenes and acting---manage to hook me and keep me wanting to hear and see more in between each mission.

UPDATE: Storyline.

I won't post any spoilers and any details on it save for one.

Like I mentioned on an ignored discussion page here, the game brings up a highly interesting plot element involving Dr. Zelinski contacting the player in all three campaigns, mentioning the Soviet Premier having travelled back in time to change the future/present.  In the Soviet campaign, he randomly disappears for no reason after telling you this.  In the Allied campaign, no one cares except when he tells them about a Soviet base on Cuba.  Only in the Japanese campaign does anyone seem to care about what Zelinski is saying, and by the end it doesn't even matter anymore.

Zelinski's message involves a supposed 'break-down' of the time-space continuum.  And yet after all the campaigns, not only is this idea not expanded on in the least, it is practically completely ignored.  If anyone remembers Yuri's Revenge, a 'break-down' of the time-space continuum caused by Einstein lead to a ""merging"" of the two timelines, causing Yuri to be destroyed and General Carville to come back to life in the ""true"" timeline.

Another highly interesting plot point completely ignored is Yuriko.  Absolutely no backstory is provided on her, nor is she given a FMV actor to portray her.  There is a clear distinction between her, Yuriko the Japanese Psychic in Red Alert 3, and Yuri the Soviet Psychic in Red Alert 2, and yet this is not explored in the least in Red Alert 3.  The storyline, while on its own interesting, is a colossal disappointment in context with Red Alert and Red Alert 2.

Solidly 3/5, perhaps at best 3.5/5.

Oh yeah, and SECUROM~!!!!!111  RUINS THE GAME! DRM aside... (2)"
3.0	PlanetSide 2 is more difficult than the older games released in the early 2000s.  The tutorial is going to take awhile.  Even the tutorial reports you will need quite a bit of experience in the game before becoming proficient.  Otherwise, the game is above average in maintaining one's interest and the graphics are quite good.  The story and role playing having a variety of alternatives to make the game flexible and a combative adventure.  Perhaps later, when I become proficient, my rating will go up.  For beginners this is a challenging game that will result in a slower learning curve.  Good luck.  If you know someone that is familiar with the game you will benefit from them helping you learn the game. A DIFFICULT BUT REWARDING SYFY GAME
3.0	I must admit I have never been a huge Mortal Kombat fan, I obtained this game from my brother not working when he was moving.  I got it working and played it at bit to my surprise no blood!  I personally could care less about this because honestly I never cared about the gore factor anyway.  Aside from that and I know for some this is a major buzz kill, the game looks great and moves are easy to pull off just like another reviewer said.  However two major down flaws your character's walks and jumps aren't very fluent.  Also it seems kind of slow I remember this game being a bit faster, the game looks wise is amazing however (given the time context and the original arcade version).  To be honest tho I remember this game in the arcades and not being a fan really I say this one is the best.  I have 2 and 3 on an arcade classic pack for Gamecube and the controls are pretty bad as well and the matches end fast.  So all and all if you have the patients for this game and you don't mind the no blood and some what shoty movements you will want this game.  As for me I mark it as just your average fighting game for it's time.  I would suggest over this game Street Fighter Turbo! This game is ok, and just ok!
3.0	ok Three Stars
3.0	The X-Men are back (Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine and Rouge) on a quest to discover who has destroyed the mutant's mansion! It is of course Apocalypse, if you could not tell from the title, a huge mechanized alien bent on destroying humanity. Anyway, this is a 3D beat them up game, which is reminiscent of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, because you have to fight countless robots. Unfortunately these countless robots all look the same, which makes for a boring game. Until you find the leader of each level, such as the Blob, Cable and Apocalypse himself. The game is pretty boring because of lack of different enemies, so it's a good thing that there is a battery save function. The graphics are stupendous, there are lots of moves and combinations, and the animations look like they came straight out of a comic book. The button configuration is unique, but a good one, R button is jump, L button is a mutant power, the B button is a fierce attack and the A button is a quick attack. 3D beat em up against 100s of robots
3.0	"The Terrible:  When you log in you have 5-10 offline messages, all from people whom want to sell you their in game money or their power leveling services.  Ignore doesn't work  against it because they create new characters multiple times per day.  This game was supposed to be the first MMO designed for DX 10...  I have yet to see that, and yes I have a DX10 capable video card.

The Bad:  The User Interface is probably one of the worst I've ever used.  Hardly any ""HotKeys"" and most of the ones that are there, require you to hold shift.  Even the ""Trader"" (the place where you go to buy items from other players) has a horrible search system.

The Good:  Combat is fun, and challenging.  Unlike most other games, you get a sense of accomplishment for having better than normal items.  The graphics are great even when you're stuck with DX 9.

Overall, this is a pretty good game for something that just came out.  The devs of the game need to get rid of the gold spammers.  They need to get DX 10 up.  And they need to re-do the GUI. The Good, the bad, and the terrible"
3.0	I got this free with my Wii (obvs), and I played it for a while... I liked the baseball, but I almost always either got a home run or a foul ball. Bowling was fun too, but however I threw the ball, it curved the wrong way. I really did like boxing though, and tennis when I had a friend around. It's fun and everything, but Wii Sports Resort is a lot better. If you're like me and you got a Wii early, well, sorry but you'll have to spend $50 just to play the better version; another $20 to play with another person. If you somehow don't have either game, don't buy this one. Save up for Resort! It's much better. Not much more than what you'd expect out of a free game.
3.0	If you only want to play through the first two Hobbit movies, go ahead and add this to your cart. But if you haven't researched this one yet, do so. They released this game to coincide with the release of one of the movies and didn't put the final chapter in the game. Nor did they release it later. I didn't know this until I got to the end of the second movie and there was no where to go. You are left in an abandoned and unfinished Middle Earth. Too bad. I was enjoying it until I hit that progress in the game. Poor, poor decision by LEGO. Game only goes through the 2nd movie!
3.0	I recently picked this up along with another game and think that this Ninja Gaiden game is decent but not great,as for the graphics they are ok but nothing phenomenal,the combat is fierce which i like and for the price it is good. I also like that there is a female character that you can play as that has a different set of moves than ryu (which mixes things up)and i like that you can gain new skills throughout the game...now on to what i don't like: The blood in this game is in my opinion overkill it is all over the place and excessive. I also don't like fighting guys on the ground and having other enemies hovering above or on a platform blasting me with rocket launchers or whatever weapons they us while i'm swarmed with enemies on the ground, its annoying getting constantly blasted while trying to defeat all of the enemies that are thrown at you,i also found it strange that they would add creatures who look like aliens and a boss who is a dinosaur into the mix..Isn't this a ninja game?.In ending i will say that i feel that the creators of this game just tried doing too much with it and that this game is simply...Over the Top. Over The Top
3.0	Once again, the Just Dance series presents a game with innovative and fun dance moves.  Literally, you can spend hours dancing and having fun. The reason I gave this only 3 stars is simply the song selection. I found myself skipping more songs of this 2014 edition than the 2012 and 2014 Kids editions that we have. Great dance game, not the best song selection
3.0	Dont let the low rating confuse you i like the product and it works 3 stars becuase MICROSOFT SHOULD HAVE THIS FROM THE SATRT you shouldve seen my face when i saw batteries ib the xbox one box are you kidding me xbox nearly a decade after you made a battery powered controller you gonna pull this again ps3 had this 10 years ago and now your gonna force me to pay extra for a recharable controller even wiiu controllers don't use batteries come on microsoft they are lucky i love halo otherwise i would never support this nonsence should be included from the start
3.0	I thought you got more than one but I only got one :(
3.0	"Hello, I bought this game for get-togethers and I must say that it is a decent package and serves its purpose. It has appeal for both kids, folks in my age group(mid-twenties to mid-thirties) and the 'grandparents' crew. The games are sort of a mixed bag.

The first thing to say is the choice of 'character' avatars that each person get's to choose. There's lots of funny-looking characters that are good for laughs to pick from. The second thing that this game has going for it is a pretty decent 'sound-track'. The beats are definitely party sounding; mind you not loud boisterous bru-ha-ha, but rather more of the bob your head while your waiting for your turn. The graphics aren't top-notch, but not to be expected from this type of game.

Now as far as the games go, I'll start with Ping Cup. A difficult game, in that the Wii maneuver for this one was awkward. It did however draw laughs for trying.

The Hoop Shoot is okay, not too difficult.  The Wii movements are easy enough.

Table Hockey is also okay, however the Wii movements are Very awkward- holding the remote at a side angle leaves you with a sore wrist after only a minute or two of gameplay.

Trivia is an alright laugh with the group.

Skill Ball is also okay, although its similarity to Bowling from Wii sports takes away from its uniqueness but its fun nonetheless.

And the last two games' are Darts and Shuffle board. These are pretty much the makers of the game as they offer a more competitive feel than any of the other ones, mostly because its four-players (unlike the Table Hockey) and because the movements are bearable and easy enough. The Darts is alot of fun, especially once one player figures out 'where' they should aim, repeatedly, given where they are sitting, standing, ... leaning, lying down, slouching, etc. The Shuffle board has the 'oooooohhhh factor'; in that you watch the puck slowly, slowly...slowly approach its edge, saying 'ooooooooooohhh' and hoping it stops the furthest for yourself and not for anyone else.

So overall the game is definitely geared towards a medium-sized group setting, even though you have only a maximum of 4-people playing at once. The Dart, Shuffle Board to Skill ball make the game, and the feel is competitive enough in these games, coupled with the music, the pop-up scoring is good for laughs and 'in-your-face' gloating.

Overall its a decent and fun game, not something you'd play unless you've got a bunch of folks to hang with, and certainly not something you would play daily. Decent"
3.0	Productsreview was way better than the game play good game, not great
3.0	"This is the second Tomb Raider game I've played.  I guess I'm playing backwards, as I started with Underworld, and enjoyed that mostly.  I was looking forward to playing Anniversary, as many Tomb Raider diehards really liked it.  But ultimately, the controls and camera take away from the great story, terrific puzzles and riddles, and amazing artwork and scenery.

3rd person view games usually are frustrating for me, as the camera controls are difficult to keep consistent.  It just hammers my eyes sometimes, and makes it hard to focus, especially when the character gets jammed in a corner and you cannot see anything.  Anniversary had so many instances when I simply could not see what was going on, that after a while, I just had to stop playing, and come back to it another day (something which my video game addiction usually never requires!)

I also found the controls totally inconsistent.  Sometimes, you can jump up onto a column, then jump to a handhold just fine, and play through till you die.  Then, when you go back to repeat the whole sequence again, you jump onto the column, jump for the handhold and just fall down and miss.  Same exact sequence of commands, but they only work 50% of the time.  Very very frustrating.

Anniversary also had some scenes where the whole process was so massively confusing, that I also had to walk away.  Even the gunplay was awkward and imprecise, whereby you aim right at the enemy's head, and hammer away with a shotgun, but nothing happens.  A good example of spastic controls would be the T Rex part in the early portion of the game, where no matter what I did, I simply could not get the dumb beast to crash into the things that are supposed to kill it. I ended up standing in a corner and putting 500 rounds into it over the course of 20 minutes (which many people seem to have done)

There are so many wonderful things about this game, from the tightly coupled checkpoint system, to the mind blowing artwork and scenery, that its too bad the controls made it so hard to play.

I think I've become hooked on these Tomb Raider games (thanks to Stella at [...]), and I will continue to play these games.  But I hope that there is continued refinement in the controls and camera as we move forward.  All in all, Tomb Raider Anniversary has everything to make it a classic, except rational playability and consistency. Frustrating and painful, somewhat fun, and nearly impossible to control"
3.0	"You know, I feel like my old Xbox 360 controllers are tanks. You can practically run one over with a car and keep playing. I'm exaggerating, of course. But the fact is, I've never had one break on me... and I've got three large dogs with tails just the right height to sweep things off the coffee table and send them crashing to the hard wood floors.

But these Xbox One controllers? Man, I feel like you just look at them wrong and they stop working. I honestly don't even know how many of them I've gone through now... it's almost enough to make me jump ship from the Xbox.

And it's not like I'm unreasonably hard on my controllers, either. (Other than, like I said, the occasional dog mishap.)

When they are working, however, they are good controllers. The differences from the old 360 controllers are mostly subtle, but enough to be noticeable. It's more comfortable in the hand, and the buttons generally feel more responsive.

Too bad I feel like I have to cover them in bubble wrap to protect them from the big bad living room. A delicate little flower"
3.0	It's not a bad game but just SSX Tricky is far better game play imho ehhhh
3.0	I'm used to the action replay cartridge, so I have been spoiled by being able to cut and paste code into the code manager and then transfer it to my AR.  Xploder takes more effort and persistance if the codes you want aren't preloaded.  They have to be entered manually, and you can't mix codesets with different master codes--so you might end up with more than one group of codes that can't be activated simultaneously.  I got this to use with Gen3 pokemon, and I have at least 2 codesets for each game.  It got me the event pokemon and so forth eventually, but it took quite a bit of work. Works but takes some effort
3.0	It is exactly as described Three Stars
3.0	"This is a game that is the best in some area's and the worst in others.
(All of these ratings are out of 5.0)
Gameplay
Good idea, but it is to hard, to annoying and there aren't any bonuses like shortcuts or special areas or different routes.  It's all race like this and nothing else.  Strategy has no effect in this game, which is probably the worste part.
Rating 0.5
Graphics
Wonderful graphics.  If every area was as good as that this would be my favorite game in the world.  It is taking advantage of everything Xbox has to offer.
Rating 5.0
Sound
Wonderful.  Over 30 songs, plus you can create your own soundtrack.  Wonderful!
Rating 4.9
Variety
This game lacks variety a lot.  I mean GT Racing 2002 has over 120 cars while this only has just more than 20.  The tracks are hard which makes it hard to enjoy the big lot of tracks it has to offer.
Rating 1.0
Total
2 Good things.  2 Bad things.  Should be right around the middle (which is not good when it comes to games.)
Rating 2.8
So in the end I rounded it up to 3 which is not good for a game like this. Lots of Ups, and Lots of Downs"
3.0	Do not expect much diversity in game play, all planes fire same rockets and drop the same bombs, it's just a matter of how much they carry.  There is some difference in machine guns.  You can't customize anything.  Some stealth missions, but mostly it's the classic kill everything that moves deal, which is comprised of turning left or right to flank the other plane long enough to hit him with your guns, there is not complexity in maneuvers.  The bullet time feature does make it a bit more interesting. This game is LONG and the story will begin to bore you, I was also a little pissed that there were no American planes in the game.  In fact this game follows the entire war and does not even mention America so if you are hoping to hop into a P-51 and eat Luftwaffe for dinner you'll need to find a different title.  I did enjoy the game for what it is, and if you can pick it up under 10 bucks like I did go for it. Fairly Fun
3.0	The game is ok gets a bit repetitive after a while It's ok
3.0	Kids like it. Lego has really figured out how to get the most money out of its customers with these add on sets and figures. You will pay over $300 if you buy everything for this game. That's ridiculous, but I knew that coming in to it, so I can't hold it against them I don't suppose. Here we are a month after Christmas and the kids haven't played in a couple of weeks. That's probably just their ADHD kicking in and nothing negative against Lego Dimensions. Low starting fee, high add on fees
3.0	"I picked this up down the street used for around 6 bucks.  That's about what it's worth.  It's just a boring shooter.  I mean, back in the day, when 3-D graphics were new, ""Quake"" was just awesome.  It was the game to beat.  But these days - with every single game being some form of 3-D immersion, the coolness of Quake has long since vanished.
-
It's a boring shooter.  I didn't think any of the weapons, or their subsequent upgrades, were that good.  I rarely used the top gun - that dark matter one - it's just weak.  So many other games have had so many cooler and better weapons.  The graphics are fine - but what game isn't these days?  I felt the game was far too difficult.  There are so few health paks around, you die all the time.  I got pretty frustrated with it and looked up the cheat codes online and blew through it in under a week.  It just wasn't engaging or rewarding enough to fight through waves of aliens or zombie-people or whatever to play it as-is.  It did have a bit of a dark side to it, which was neat.  But this game is, at the outset, utterly forgettable. Just a mind-numbing boring shooter."
3.0	"I am a serious gamer and really enjoy getting into my games. yknow getting lost in the story and characters and really immersing myself in it. So I stayed away from this one due to the awful rep. of comic book and movie adaptions. But after reading nothing but good stuff about it and how the critics raved it to be a must have, I went and got it. I was very excited to wear the cape and be the most iconic superhero to ever grace our imaginations. And at first all seemed well, then I got to see the first cut-scene, bats and jokes look okay but the rest are all SURPRISED or something, I mean I know these are only filler characters but it is really annoying to me, I mean how could you put out a serious game with all your characters looking like they just put their finger in a light socket?  So I was gonna let that slide, then the boredom set in, I made it about halfway through until I just couldn't stay awake anymore. The game tries to throw some interesting things your way, but you can see it coming a mile away, and for a prison there sure isn't much in ""finding"" a route to some unreachable place, there is always a heating duct to get in, and all of these are the same.  The boss battles even worse, they look nice but are easy and uneventful. This feels to me like a straight run through beat `em up and move on. I really feel it deserved more attention to almost every level, and there should have been more to do then just run around looking for the next heating duct. The fighting system is okay but that gets boring pretty quick too, you can only press the same button so many times before you say, well is there something more? I still don't understand why it is toted so high, I would say pass or buy very cheap if you are a mature gamer like me. Batman, soaring in bored."
3.0	Its ok. Was expecting a better game but recieved a crappy DBZ ripoff. The Story mode sucked and the characthers are crap. I sold this game to a pawn shop because it was horrible.even the graphics blow Well
3.0	"Pariah started out with a lot of promise.  The storyline seemed like it was headed towards something great.  The weapons and scenery started out unique.

However, once I got to the final level, I realized that there was very little storyline.  After beating the game, I realized that I wasted several hours of my life.

The scenery looks nice at first, but they you realize that there are only 4 different types of scenery that was being constantly recycled.

The weapons too seemed very similar and without much change between them.  There were basic weapons such as a machine gun, shotgun, and sniper rifle... but nothing truly unique or interesting (especially for being a sci-fi game).

One good thing I can say about this game is that it was not too short and not too long.  It seemed to be a good balance as far as that goes. Decent game, lacking story, and repetitive fighting"
3.0	Robin was in perfect condition but the box looked like it had been through a typhoon. It was terrible and I feared Robin would be ruined too because so much water damage to the box but he was LUCKILY OK. Robin was in perfect condition but the box looked like it had been ...
3.0	Amusing the first couple of times we played it, but got dull fast. I am grateful I didn't pay much for this game, because it was worth what I paid for it. Cheap game, worth the money I paid for it which wasn't much.
3.0	Nice game Three Stars
3.0	"plays both SFC and SNES games! Works very well. However it doesn't work will all SNES games. My copy of Shaq-fu won't work in this and I've tried multiple copies.  It also cannot read NES games. The cables feel a little fragile but overall this is highly recommend. Especially if you want to import SFC games!

Edit: The lack of eject button on this is scary. My F-zero copy got bent pulling it out. Famicom games seem to come out all right. Awesome for SFC games!"
3.0	According to wikipedia, MS switched their solder to lead-free (from what they were using before) at the last minute for all consoles to meet EU standards.  This actually makes a lot of sense because I was able to get it to work but then it broke again. Worked for about 1 month
3.0	Fun game! I paid less than $10 for this and played it for hours. Even if you don't follow the Warhammer universe this game will keep most people engaged. Fun times
3.0	Not as good as some of the others I have played but not the worst either. There are a few things I wish they would have done differently with building your own terrain and I am not real crazy about the way building highways works either. Other than that it is a typical sim city. My favorite so far is still sim city 2000 though. SIM CIty
3.0	The design looks good and allows all the LEDs to show, but the dock would be better if it had some weight. Taking the 3DS out requires two hands sometimes. Plugging in also isn't effortless like the old dock; you actually have to push the 3DS into the dock which feels like wedging plastic. Charge and Display your 3DS
3.0	"Well, whenever someone sees ""James Bond"" on a game, its probably gonne be picked up. Well, I was walking around at blockbuster, and that exact same phenomenon happend to me. I took it home, popped it in, and began the first mission. I was at parts amazed, at parts extremely disapointed while playing ""007: Agent Under Fire."" (by EA Games).
1. Gameplay: Okay...but not very good in a lot of parts. First, it just feels too easy. You go around shooting people who don't usually shoot back. The game is based on AUTO-AIM, which really kills gameplay.  The people don't look half as good as they should, and the missions overall are short and easy. There isn't much of a variety of guns. There is hardly any ammo, and for that case, what you come with isn't very much. The guns aren't very creative either. Just a handgun, maybe a rifle here or there.
Vehicles: You normally control just one or two every 5 levels. One time you get to control a car with a ton of weaponry, but it's gets old after awhile. The ability though, when you have an assistant in the car, to shoot from the headroof was extremely COOL. That was one of the few places you got all kinds of guns. Vehicles are here, they're just not that common.
Story: Pretty good; it actually has one at least. You must save a hostage, escape the terrorists, take out people in stealth, break into the room, etc... It actually went by a story line, but the crappy part was Jame's girlfriend gets...
2. Graphics: Decent, but not good. People's hands don't have 5 fingers, the backgrounds and guards and such don't have faces. Bullet marks disapear after going into the wall. No weather factors, collapsing buildings, etc... The graphics here were, once again, good, NOT GREAT!
3. Sound: Probably the best part of the game. The voice acting (while people's mouths don't move when they talk) is excellent. The sounds of gun shells falling to the floor after re-loading brings the gameplay alive! The cars squel when they start fast, explosions rock the screen. Overall, it's pretty good. The music in the background is...BOND, of course. The sound was the best part of the game in my opinion, that and:
Multiplayer: Very fun! The levels are fairly large, and the variety of weapons is huge! From jump packs, canons, bazukas, shot guns, snipers, handguns, etc...there are tons of guns. The game keeps score, and you can work as a team in 4-player; 2 on 2 combat! There are life vests to keep your health up, and the overall gameplay is good. I loved only one part of this game. it was the multiplayer!
This game, overall, is a good game in terms of how much is costs (a twenty should cover it at most stores). Persounally, I'd buy it for the multiplayer, not the story mode. Something to chill on the couch and play with yours buds in multiplayer, or even watch someone breeze through the story in a matter of an hour or two. This game is a blast in some ways, and a MAJOR disapointment in others. I plan on buying it...maybe (after renting it for a week).
Thx! A good game, but defenantly NOT great!"
3.0	"Calling this a Tomb Raider game is not at all appropriate. Square Enix took everything that made Tomb Raider fun and threw it out the window. It's a survival game, not at all an adventure game. None of the clever puzzles, none of the light, upbeat fun. Just dark, mature themes like you'd see in a zombie game. None of the Prince of Persia style climbing and acrobatics. I'm 7% into the game and just want to explore the terrain like you used to be able to do with relative ease. But I can't because as soon as I start walking around, I get attacked by packs of wolves. And only have a lame ass bow and arrow to try to fend them off. And if I do fend them off, they just send more and I just die. No freedom. No fun. Just constant running from stuff and trying not to die. Then throw in stupid stealth challenges and I just give up.

Unless they go back to the roots, I'll never buy another game in this franchise. God, I hate Square Enix. They've ruined Laura Croft. Why did they feel like she needed a ""reboot"" and reimaging? What was wrong with big boobed and witty? Or casual, upbeat fun? Why this frazzled, tragic character? Why this completely different style of survivalist, dark gameplay? THAT'S NOT LAURA! What a tragic end to an awesome legacy. Even at the $20 I paid, I feel totally scammed and ripped off. I won't even bother trying to finish it.

I'm generously giving it 3 stars only because the game itself is well crafted and looks fantastic. I'm sure many hardcore gamers would love it. I just don't because as I've said, it's not a Tomb Raider game. And this style of game is nothing I've ever enjoyed. Not a Laura Croft game at all"
3.0	Kids got bored quick. Not sure if its just my kids taste Vs the actual game itself. kids got bored
3.0	"Pros: Good Graphics, Great Music, Original battle style...
Cons: all the JRPG cliches are present in this game, the story was above the average, why? Because it had this feeling of ""I've seen this before, but when I saw it, it was better"", therefore I can say that the plot of this game even though that it is strongly focused on Chopin's last moments *spoiler*, is not original, we have the classic damsel in distress, the evil villian who wants to destroy everything,The guy that wants to be the hero at any cost, the chessy love triangle, a war between kingdoms and the annoying children characters... all the things you'd probably seen in a Final Fantasy or other JRPG's, therefore there's nothing innovative with this Videogame.
The cinematics boring as hell, and somewhat unnecessary, (Really, the enging takes about 45 minutes, and there's nothing special of it, because if you are an RPG fan, you'll know how this game is going to end). And the gameplay especially the battle system, that in the beginning is fun, but it turns frustraiting when you need to do a serious level up in order to not to get killed by the Boss at the end of the Level, a very BORING task.
The characters are dull, full of cliches (as I mentioned before) and some of them are really annoying and unnecessary for this plot.
This game could have been AMAZING, but this Eternal Sonata is a dissonant piece, give it a chance only if you already played all the great RPG's that PS3 has like Star Ocean or Final Fantasy XIII and XIII-2. Eternal So-Boring"
3.0	"I received this product recently and was surprised to see it only came with 1 CABLE.
The bulk packaging I received weighs 7 oz NOT 3 lbs. (I weighed the package on my postal scale since I am a online seller I thought since the description said 3 lbs there would be 2 Cables. WRONG)
The contacts are NOT GOLD AS STATED in the description they are silver tone metal.
If I knew it was only for 1 cable I would have looked somewhere else since I have multiple consoles.
Descriptions need to be accurate, for the buyer sake! It is very unfair that I didn't get what I thought I was going to receive.
The seller needs to be more specific about this item for the simple fact that it is not true, dimension wise the cable is 5 ft 10 inches long.
Not happy. Live and learn! Only 1 Cable Not 2 as Pictured or Described."
3.0	meh Three Stars
3.0	Its an ok product for what it is, a bluetooth device that allows catching without touching your phone.  Don't expect to multitask though, the game will restart and disconnect from the device if you decide to use another app.  Will also disconnect randomly for no reason so it becomes a hassle to constantly reconnect it. WIll work most of the time
3.0	"I see a lot of value in this earpiece. You can use it on your Xbox, then switch it over to Bluetooth mode and take it with you for use with your phone (or any other Bluetooth device).

However, after wearing it for a couple of minutes, I did not like the feel of it on my ear. I tried all the included hooks and earbuds, but it always felt like the headset was going to fall off my ear. It never actually did, but it felt like it. Perhaps all headsets like this feel that way, but regardless this is just not for me.

I do encourage you to give this a try, especially if you are comfortable with other Bluetooth headsets like this. There is some great technology here. Great technology, but not for my ear."
3.0	"Graphics: 9
Gameplay: 9
Story: 6
Ending: 7
Length: 3

Fun, but never hits you or really climaxes in any way, the ending just kind of happens to you, I didn't even get the sense I was on the last mission. Fairly good"
3.0	"Singularity, for the most part is a great game.  It came out in during a time when shooters had flooded the market.  Everyone was trying to capitalize on COD's success.  Some were more successful than others and Singularity should have probably made a bigger dent than it did. But that's what happens when you're trying to infiltrate a crowded market.

Why three stars?  There's one game-breaking sequence that has made me rage quite dozens of times.  I don't know what genius thought the sewer sequence when you're bombarded by these god-forsaken exploding ticks was a good idea.  It seriously the worst sequence of any game I have ever played - ever.  They come at you by the dozens, are somehow impervious to shotgun shells, slow your running and then kill you.  I honestly hated this part more than anything I have ever hated in a video game.  The first time I played this game, I died two dozen times before completely giving up on it for three or four years.  It was that terrible an experience.

It's a real shame because the rest of the game is fantastic.  It has some fun mechanics, good gunplay, fun story and while linear, is still a lot of fun.

And it was completely ruined by one stupid sequence. Great game, One unforgiveable sequence"
3.0	i found gameplay a bit tedious and the story line only fair its ok
3.0	"Maybe I am just getting old, but I am tired of seeing smooth, air-brushed, cutesy graphics in many games these days. Perhaps they are designing them for pre-teens, but as an adult gamer I want a grittier, more realistic style of graphics. If they do this to Diablo III I will not play it.

I tried playing the demo of this game and made it through the couple hours of play included in the demo. I couldn't help noticing the similarity to screenshots I've seen of World of Warcraft. KoA:R is perhaps better looking but it just looks like where WoW is going to be in a few years.

Oh well...just not my style. I prefer the look of games like The Witcher, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age and I don't want soft, cartoonish graphics.

*****************************************

Updated after playing several hours of full game...

I have to say that I am enjoying this game in spite of the art style. There are enough other elements which are included that make it fun for an old school RPG gamer. First, there are plenty of customization options as you level up whether you choose melee, range or magic. Second, if you are a completest (the gamer who has to solve every quest and cover all of the map) there is a ton to do with main quests and a variety of secondary and faction quests. On the other hand, if you want to just stick to the main plot and quest lines, you could do that as well. Third, there is enough story, lore, and background information to make it interesting if you like to have a deeper experience. Of course if you are not into that aspect, you could instead hack and slash your way through without worrying about minor story lines.

So, I just wanted to update my review to give credit where I felt credit was due. I still don't like the WoW type visuals, but I am glad I purchased the game and gave it a thorough chance to capture my interest. It did. Raised my rating after sticking with it. 3.5 stars"
3.0	If you have played the original, Batman Arkham Asylum you may enjoy this game. It is set before the events at the asylum take place with Batman donning the mask to become the superhero we know and love. Batman is at it again
3.0	Allow me to try and write a review based upon countless hours of play and analyzing the layout and structure.  First, this is a 4x, DEEP strategy title.  When first starting the game, leaving the help hints on and seriously reading them can help you better understand the workings.  The manual; I use only to look up a reference if something is confusing me (a.k.a. what Casus Belle was).  If you try to understand the game by reading it cover to cover you won't succeed.  It takes TIME to understand how the game manages the A.I - and YES, you WILL be using the A.I. in LOTS of cases.  The programmers wanted the gamer to feel like he's the leader/president/emperor of a galactic civilization, not a viceroy of a particular planet or solar system, therefor micro managing is definitely out of the question.  Looking back over your systems from time to time to fine tune is what will get you ahead, not working out each detail of each planet each turn.  Another part of the game - shipyard construction, can be very confusing if you don't know how each style of ship can be used.  The only way to decide is to play, create ships, and see what happens.  It's now second nature to me to create fleets and ship types, but it took many hours of understanding before I could finally do it `on the fly'.  This review may sound cryptic, but really the only way to understand the game is to dedicate and play, with an open mind and a willingness to use your imagination.  I personally believe that the A.I. could have been fine - tuned to balance ship and troop construction (It seems to build too much of a certain type).  The game is slow, but consuming.  I recommend it for anyone who loves deep strategy and has a willingness to learn.  It could have been better though.  Try to borrow or rent before you buy ^_^;; Trying to be fair on all aspecs of this title....
3.0	Kind of a pain to apply and didn't include any directions. Three Stars
3.0	"There's a cannon at the top of the screen and loads of blue & orange balls/pegs all over the place. Aim, shoot, and try to clear all the orange bits before you run out of shots. There's some skill involved in how you aim and time the shot, but mostly it just depends on luck.

I'd recommend trying the free 60 minute version before buying (on the Pop Cap website). This isn't a relaxing, mindless game like Bejeweled or Plants vs. Zombies. It will kill a lot of time for sure, but I wouldn't put it in the fun category like other Pop Cap games. I guess if you really got into figuring out the scoring then it might give you a goal with this game. Otherwise it's just the same thing over & over, with the only change being the configuration of the pegs. A large part of the game is left up to chance & luck, so it can get pretty frustrating. When you fail at a level the orange pegs move around on the next try, so you aren't able to 'learn' how to beat a level.

The graphics are nice, and the only real downside to the setup is that when you *finally* clear a level (after dozens of tries), you have to sit through the fireworks show while your points tally up. It's the same show each time, so it gets repetitive (and annoying). Demented Pinball"
3.0	bueno Three Stars
3.0	"This game definitely wins in the graphics department, but if you're looking for SSX type gameplay (except with an ATV) you're going to be disappointed. Before you can even begin to deal in the real races, you have to be able to pass 5 ""simple"" tests. The first four are no problem, but then you have to run a lap in under 30 seconds, and the only way to do so is to pull off tricks. Rather than a simple ""X"" or ""O"" button mashing system, you have to use the stick to pop your ATV into a trick at the right time and then push a button in air to execute a trick. It takes a while to get used to this, but it can be done.

There are a lot of fun things about this game. You can customize you ATV from the ground up in color and such, but you have to win races to get money to do so.

A casual gamer will probably not find this game very fun, but if you are willing to invest the time and get into it, you'll enjoy this experience. As I said before, the graphics are amazing, and you really can feel like you're riding the off-road trails. Great graphics, but sometimes frustrating gameplay"

3.0	"For the most part it is Dark Souls 2, but I would wait for the walk-through guides to be updated before playing.  I am a game completionist, I collect everything.

I loved Dark Souls 1, played it 7+ times, but imagine if some of the soul farming was removed (Hence the bonfire near the stone gate outside the Dark Forest).  Well, this version of Dark Souls 2 (In my opinion) is really a marketing ploy to get those that already played Dark Souls 2 to purchase this version.

For Example, In the first area (Things Betwixt) the walk-throughs talk of a 3rd training area/ Fog Gate.  In this version you can't immediately gain access to that area because there is a stone statue in the way & the AI behind that door has changed.  OK fine, but none of the walk-throughs were up to date, I wasted an hour combing through chat rooms trying to get other peoples opinion of why I couldn't access the area.  It appears the area was used for farming and the developers put a stop to it. Alternative Dark Souls 2 Version, Beware of Walk-through Variations"
3.0	"This is my first encounter with the Sid Meier's Civilization games. From What I know, Beyond Earth follows the formate of the previous games. Its very intelligent and complex game with many options and many possible outcomes.

This is preliminary as I have not finished a 500 turn senario of the game.

There are 8 groups to choose from and 3 development paths to seek. Victory is basically determined by which path you seek in 500 turns, and I didn't like how victory happens.

Development is very complex with random events occurring. One decision effect another event or influences the other colonists that land later. As in the other games diplomacy is a big deal.

I basically liked the game but have some issues with the interface and games choices.

You can choose which colonist group or sponsor to be with but each group is tied to a specific leader.

Bringing up the Buildings list is cumbersome and I wish they had a better popup on that.

The extended manual does not cover things completely. For instance, you have the option of installing a city defense called Tacjet. The thing nags you every turn to do a sweep or attack, even when theres nothing to attack. So if you put it to sleep I was unable to recall it up later when one of those big earth worms came close to a development. There wasn't even any alert option like some of the ground unites have!

I think some of the technology is quirky. Like orbital platforms used to clear miasma, some sort of malignancy. A rover or worker could do that. And orbital platforms cant be move once placed and have this nag screen on what to do after every turn- need to automate that. Air unites are limited to drones. And when the upgrade has been done many ground unites can travel over water when in real life a transport would have been better- quicker.

Planet aliens seem to be limited to some sort of bug, worm and fish lifeforms, not very intelligent.

I would have liked to see more encounter screens and more intrigue with aliens, how about a little adventure to mix it up with the sratagy and diplomacy. As it is the game is conducted with icons on a map. I think this game needs some more intelligence and thinking. There could be addons to enhance the game.

Another thing I hated about the game is it didn't come complete on the disk. I had to do over 3 gigabytes of download though their online interface program, Steam. I had to go to a Starbucks store and it took me 7 hours to complete due to the irregular bandwidth of the WIFI there. I left with a very sore butt from thier hard chairs. Im new to WIFI so I couldn't tell you why it varied from 150-kbs to zilch kbs at a rated speed of 180-kbs. It would be nice if I could have at least been able to use a downloader for the files in separate install packages but they may be trying to prevent unauthorized distribution of the game. I would have paid extra to get the downloads on disk.

The basic interface window is OK but even on my 22 LCD screen the top info bar was tiny. Navigation was OK, but I wish I had the option of taking back an unintended move.

I recommend a fast computer, Icore 5 at least with 6 MB of memory, a beefy graphics card and a SSD of at least 128 GB and a large monitor screen of at least 20~22

When you first play the game, interface with it for 200 turns and then get the extended manual, youll need it. Use the advisor/guide AI to help you learn how to play and interact. You most likely will never tire of the game for months and its very absorbing for a strategy game. Challenging to Play, Needs Improvements"

3.0	"I rated this as a 3 because the campaign is so inappropriate, I don't like the stealing and all the nasty stuff, just the Dodge Charger blown over and the Camaro or Firebird they have, Except no copyright, so they don't actually call them that, just not quite what I was looking for when it comes to ""HOT RODS"". My friends said there were hot rods, and it turned out to be muscle cars, which I love, but I wanted multiplayer free roam with 49 Mercury or Chevy, pickups, and other things, not just a Charger, which I am not so fond of compared to pickups or Chevelles, but still a great game for the multiplayer activities and shinanigans you can get into by blowing up friends when they have their favorite cars with an RPG. I like the multiplayer a lot"
3.0	neat game, not a halo or gears of war, but fun, the time warp device is cool to turn stuff old to new (on allowable items) just got it so I quit shorty after and rated, besides vampire diaries is back on and I wanted to recap of the last episode before I watched the new one.  the game is fun though, monsters are really scary, no joke, kind of like that movie with will smith scary.  so have fun worth the six bucks it cost me and that included shipping. pretty cool
3.0	"I bought this just for the guitar(it was cheaper than buying a single guitar).

To keep it short and simple, the Aerosmith songs on the game disc suck. Im just not into that kind of music. I bought GH3 later and it was SO much better 5 stars for GH3, 1 star for Aerosmith. The bundle gets two more stars for the guitar, which is just fine. Aerosmith isn't for the ""rocker"" generation..."
3.0	"The game itself is difficult, and if you want realistic difficult poker this is the game. There is no way to skip through the tournaments and they usually take like 1-2 hours to complete. The PSP game doesnt offer much customization as I hoped. And once you beat the one tournament (the main event) you basically are done. I played the main event and placed 130 in it, In order to compete in it again I had to create a new profile and new person. The presentation is nice and The WI-FI play lets you set up private custom games with your friends which is nice. Maybe the upcoming WPT game will be better. This one didn't strike gold but its worth a rent, and if your a hardcore poker player looking for some TOUGH training get this.

3 stars for Presentation, On-line play, and very high difficulty.

3.0	"Single player is not that great. There are only a few planes to fly. The missions are heavy on the player doing the work (example, in the Hiryu Midway mission you have to shoot down about 15 Zeroes. In reality, the Japanese could only launch a TOTAL of about 15 Zeroes, so why does the player, in an SBD, have to fight ALL of THEM?!?!?!

Mechanics are not bad. Planes fly well. I was expecting more missions with different aircraft since the review states there are many aircraft to fly. However, most of the aircraft are only for multiplayer. Birds of Steel"

3.0	"Overall the idea of this gaming mouse is great! I have very large hands and customizing this Mouse to my hands was easy and very effective. The pinky rest is GREAT and gave me more precision when gaming.

My biggest complain is the software driver for MAC. The drivers for this mouse does not work as expected. If you want to map the side buttons to actual keys it uses macros instead of button assignment designation and so games like Starcraft 2 will not recognize the mapping.

For instance I map my Shift and Control buttons to those side buttons for easy assigning of groups. Does not get recognized in Starcraft 2 while my Razr mouse does. Talked to support to no avail.

If that's not an issue to you then the mouse is worth it for its transformer like flexibility and awesome features! Flexible mouse but software driver has some issues."

3.0	"Being a Star Wars fan can be an expensive way to live your life- there are literally thousands of books, games, comics, and toys to choose from, and if you're on a limited budget like I am, you have to be choosey. There was a time when Star Wars games were the pinnacle of video games- back during the original X-wing, TIE Fighter and the first two Dark Forces games, Lucas Arts produced superb quality adventures with great stories. I think Episode I changed all that as the mad rush to cash in on new Star Wars movies opened the door to mediocrity. Instead of producing only a few titles, the flood gates were open.
Jedi Starfighter is very much a middle of the road kind of game. It is for sure heads and tales above `Battle For Naboo', but a far cry from TIE Fighter. The sequel to the initial Starfighter game, Jedi Starfighter incorporates a new story and the Delta-7 ship that Obi-Wan flew in `Attack of the Clones'. The story is ironically topical with modern day real life- the Trade Federation is in cahoots with a warlord named Captain Toth to produce bioweapons, leading Jedi Master Adi Gallia to investigate. The game also brings back the Fiorin Nym and his sidekicks from the original.
Game play is pretty basic- fly around and shoot things while accomplishing mission goals. Since you can fly several craft, you get a host of weapons other than lasers, but also swarmer missiles, depth charges, cruise missiles and little guided attack ships that surround your target and shoot at it. When you fly as Adi in the Jedi Starfighter, you gain the addition of Force Powers that you can use against enemy ships. A neat idea, but the execution doesn't really pay off and the abilities are not as good as the other ship's weapons. As an added bonus, when you progress you can unlock other ships like an X-wing, a TIE fighter and Slave 1.
Where it falls down is that the game is too easy. I could have finished it entirely in my first sitting had I not had other things to do. Even on Hard it wasn't all that tough, plus if I died, it was usually because I crashed into something and not because I got shot down. The challenge just wasn't there. It also became frustrating sometimes during missions because of the in-game chatter between pilots that moved the story along could not be overridden so that you could issue orders to wingmen. You would have to wait till they stopped yammering before you could order someone to attack or protect your target.
The graphics are so-so by Playstation 2 standards and decidedly sub-par for the PC. However, it rarely suffers from a low frame rate because of too much action o the screen, plus it's very colorful. Everything is well detailed, with well designed models. Explosions, like so many other games, are kind of lifeless. The sound is quite good, though Slave 1's weapons and engine noise are nothing like they were in Episode II. Also on the upside are a mess of extras that come with it like concept art and commentaries by the programmers, always a plus. This game is best bought as a Greatest Hits and not at full price. Ho-Hum..."
3.0	"Background: I have played most of the Final Fantasies, including FFVI (released as III on SNES in the US), which definitely showed that 16 bit RPGs can mix excellent gameplay and a compelling story. I did not play this one when it came out as Final Fantasy II.

The gameplay for this FF is your usual RPG fare of random battles and an ATB bar. However the ATB system is broken. There were many times in battle where my characters were completely skipped over, so their bars would just refill. Even more often, I would enter a command and the game would either take awhile to execute the action (after I entered in commands for others and they acted before the first character) or just completely skip the action that I entered. Always in battle, the game does not respond right away to buttons being pressed, so commands are even more delayed.

The story was alright. I did not find myself really caring about any of the characters (as I have in most). There was no loving relationship between any of them either (a kind of Cloud/Aeris or Squall/Rinoa relationship). The ending seemed to just have that ""slapped together at the last minute"" feeling.

I did enjoy acquiring the summons and ultimate weapons (for the few characters that had them). However, once getting them and having the characters at 50+ levels, the final boss is incredibly easy compared to most of the monsters found in the final dungeon. And the game is still very short after all that. I find no incentive to do the Lunar Ruins.

If this was your first FF back in the SNES days, then I understand why you like this one so much, but after VI-X (well VI-IX really) the bar for an excellent RPG has been significantly raised. An OK Fantasy"
3.0	Well, you have to play first of all The Force Unleashed (I mean the first game) in order to understand the plot of this one, there is no much diference from the first one in reference on the gameplay, the end is good, but the story mode ends just in a couple of hours, it could have been longer I am still waiting for the best Star Wars game ever
3.0	"Dragon Age: Origins being a lovely homage to classic Infinity Engine role-playing games was a great surprise and a light in the darkness of mid-2000's PC gaming, where it seemed everything was console-focused. Dragon Age 2, while deeply flawed, at least maintained that tactical PC style combat at the heart of it. Now, in an age where indie studios, Kickstarter and digital distribution have opened the gates to numerous classic PC style RPGs, where does the third Dragon Age game come out? Firmly in the console action game camp, sadly.

There are a few immediate aspects to Inquisition you need to know. First, the areas and quests and extremely MMO-like in how they play. This is an offline WoW game with action combat, very similar to Kingdoms of Amalur, which I reviewed a couple years ago. Quest dialog is very rare and very simple when it happens. Most quests will be started by letters or discovering them on your war room map. None of them have cinematic or dialog tree moments, all of them play just like an MMO quest would. There are many ""collect 10 of these for the villagers"" quests. There are many enemy bases that are nothing but several rooms of enemies and a boss who attacks on-sight. There are even fairly obvious respawns should you turn around for any reason!

Secondly, this game controls like a port of a gamepad action game. That's not to say the PC version controls ""badly"" necessarily, as for a standard WASD action game I think it controls about normal. The lack of click-to-move and click-to-attack and such is a fundamental game decision, not a control issue. You play this game running around the fields and mashing your attack buttons when you stumble on an enemy. You run up to things and press 'E' to interact with them. It's a third-person action game in control and design, not a PC style RPG, and that's the core control ""issue."" If you like games like Witcher 2 or Kingdoms of Amalur you'll be okay here.

Lastly, the tactical combat is rare. Ninety percent of your combat experience will be in the field with trash mobs, just like an MMO. Every once in a while you will fight a boss or other set-piece, which could be considered roughly the equivalent of Dragon Age: Origins' designed tactical battles. However even in these confrontations you'll mostly be playing it action style. There are less abilities and your companions spam them appropriately, so there is little reason to switch to them and look at an empty hotbar. The game is designed to control your main character in action game fashion and anything else is superfluous. You might pause here and there to ensure someone takes a potion or gets out of dodge (on hard mode) but otherwise even in these ""tactical battles"" you can just run around and spam your abilities appropriately.

These complaints and changes aside, graphics and story are up to the usual Bioware standard. I'm playing on an older PC with a mix of medium and high settings and it still looks amazing, well above the two previous games in both scope and detail. The visual design is mostly fabulous, though it reminds you constantly that it's all for show and nothing is really happening in these great areas. While a great lighthouse can be found through exploring a beautiful swamp, once you get there all you can do is plant a flag for yet another collect-a-thon sidequest. No one lives there, no real quest goes there, it's just art for art's sake.

The main quest is very good however. I am in the final act and it goes through a lot of religious, social and personal themes that most games wouldn't touch. You can be Jesus or Judas, or you can be a frustrated atheist struggling to deal with all of it. That comes across quite well. On average the main quests are better designed than the MMO filler side-content, and offer unique dungeons and areas that feel more in tune with Dragon Age's previous. It's almost like two different games, and I wish the main quest game were the one we got everywhere else.

All in all if you like MMO quest design and action combat you will find a lot to like here. I'm still not sure as an action experience it can really top dedicated action games, but it does an okay job and the exploring and great story will be all a lot of people want or expect from it. If you're looking for a PC RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins however, you will not find it here, and you will be filled with disappointment and not a small amount of resentment as a result. Know what you're getting into going in and Inquisition might be a thrilling experience. An Offline MMO That Disappoints Dragon Age Fans, Yet Has Its Own Charms"
3.0	"I have been a Tomb Raider fan since the original. I enjoyed the previous version, which continues the story of Lara searching for her mother. But like the previous game, it was entirely too short. The original series could have you gaming for weeks. The last two series have been beaten simply in a matter of 1-2 days. The graphics are incredible. Lara has never looked better. Even with all the incredible graphics, there had to be some problems, right? The MOST annoying thing in the game is the automatic camera angle. No matter how you wanted the camera to face, it would roll back to an angle that was, at times, impossible to view. If you had a short jump with your back against the wall, the camera would zoom in so close to Lara that you couldn't see the edge from where you needed to jump...causing several untimely deaths. There are points where you can jump from wall to wall to climb higher. At one point, Lara jumped through a wall and fell into a black hole to her death. Uh, ok I guess. There are also times where she will get stuck walking around and it takes a minute for you to regain control. One of the most basic features in earlier games was left out...the opportunity to control Lara with a slow walk to the edge before performing a jump or drop to grab a ledge. In this game, Lara typically grabs the edge if you don't intend to drop, but that's not always the case.
Overall, the game is not bad at all. But if you are looking for another follow-up Tomb Raider, the ending doesn't leave any openings for one. That is somewhat disappointing. Graphics are fantastic, but that is the only thing that gets a 10 in this game. Too many bugs with camera angles and overall controls. And again, way too short for typical Tomb Raider fans. Fun, interesting, but still full of bugs."
3.0	"I haven't played an EA NHL game in close to ten years, so I decided to pick up NHL 14 when I heard about the addition of the '94 game play mode.  Really, I probably should not have bought into that gimmick.  Not having played in a while, I found the controls to be a little tricky to pick up.  Getting used to using the triggers, bumpers, and right stick for everything was an interesting learning curve to say the least.

The graphics are about the best part of the game.  It looks great when you're playing and when there are highlights.  The game play, once I got used to the controls, was okay.  Seemed about on par with what I expect from a hockey video game.  Some sports seem to lend themselves to a video game better than others and hockey just always has that 'bit of luck' feel to it.

The Enforcer Engine has to be the worst introduction ever.  While it may be true that some hockey fans want to see more fighting, it's a bit ridiculous that putting a big hit on an opposing player spawns a fight just about every game.  There's no way to skip over them either, so that's been frustrating.

I've mostly been playing the Live the Life mode which is fun at first.  After a while, though, in game expectations seem more likely to happen based on luck than player skill.  The game scores tend to be something ridiculous.  I've had several games where the npcs are so bad that it's a lopsided 5+ to 1 or 2 by the start of the third period.  The experience of playing other modes has not been overly different at times.

Basically, realistic as the game looks, it's just not realistic in relation to anything else.  Here's to hoping another vg maker gets in the game and starts giving EA some competition because this offering was nothing to get that excited about. Looks Nice, Plays Not so Nice"
3.0	I feel like this game reached its height of fun with Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2.  Since then its gone down hill.  At least you can play with more chars in your group in NWN2 and have more control over them than NWN.  However, even though NWN2 has taken some power away from the fighter types compared to NWN (no more devastating critical), it still seems like magic is MUCH less important in these games than in BG.  Also, to me a lot of the fun comes from controlling the leveling of several different kinds of characters, but there are many limits on this in NWN2 (limited number of custom characters, few choices on classes to level chars to, etc.).  If you haven't played BG,  get that at a bargain price instead. Not an improvement over NWN, not as fun as BG
3.0	Let me get this out of the way, DoA is GORGEOUS! Moving on, DoA is a good buy for your X-Box, if not for the fighting, at least for the graphics! If you have never played a DoA game before and are expecting anything close to Soul Calibur or Virtua Fighter, be warned. While DoA is a great game for button mashers and first-time players, it leaves little for the TRUE fighting game enthusiasts to bite on. After the initial shock of the eye-melting visuals subsides, you are not left with much. The fighters are hollow and don't have nearly as much attacks as other fighting games. That said, the game's reversal system is extremely smooth and satisfying, though much too easy when it comes to timing the counters. The reversal system is based more on luck than actual skill, decreasing the game's longterm value. The sound is equally hollow and is made up of lifeless grunts and yells. Being the fighting game player that I am, I am very strict about how complex I want games to be and my  expectations are high. But for the casual fighting game players, add another star to my score and buy the game. The graphics alone are reason enough to purchase this game and show your friends why X-Box is the UNDESPUTED champion when compared to the other consoles! Not The Deepest Fighter, But It Sure Is Pretty!
3.0	I played this and I think that it's pretty bad.  The charachters are very  blocky but otherwise the graphics are pretty good.  I think that if you  want a fighting game get Mortal Kombat.  Dark Rift is alright but not  great. Just another fighting game
3.0	These are stick extenters. They are as described. I have not been able to adjust to them. I thought I would give them a try. I have decided to play without them. These are stick extenters. They are as described. ...
3.0	This works fine.  The only problem is how far apart the squares are.  Not good for us short people. This is OK.
3.0	"Crysis 2 isn't a bad game by any means.  It just didn't resonate with me the way the original did.  It's highly polished, gorgeous, and plays well.  Using your Nano Suit's powers can also be very satisfying in a lot of situations.  The story isn't anything to write home about, but it does what it sets out to do and keeps the ball rolling for the most part.  The game is what I would describe as ""openly linear"" meaning you can choose certain paths to take but you only get about a football field's worth of discretion in these decisions.  I had fun on my play through but, to be honest, by the end of the game I was more than ready for it to end.  I could see myself playing through the game again down the road, but I have no interest in doing that anytime soon.  I spent about ten hours in the multiplayer and wasn't really impressed.  You can have some fun there, but what I experienced was so-so considering the wide variety of games in this genre there are to choose from.  If you're interested I would recommend trying it, just don't expect to be blown away. Preferred the Original"
3.0	GOOD Three Stars
3.0	Not sold on this yet. Never really get used to the touchpads IMO. Three Stars
3.0	"I had great expectations about this game, especially after reading the 5-star reviews here and the 9/10 mark from gaming sites. I bought the game and played it, only to be disappointed. Essentially, this game is MOO2 with good and bad modifications, but overall worse than MOO2 and with uneven performance in terms of features.

PROS

1) More flexibility in ship design and look. This is almost a minigame in itself and can be quite fun.
2) Starbases can now be designed almost like ships through upgrades and can be placed almost anywhere.
3) There are now resource locations to be mined.
4) Trade routes are now actual ships you can design, build, manage, and attack.
5) What a ship can do in a turn is based on its speed. Faster transports can shuttle more population per turn, especially between close locations.

CONS

Even more annoying economic system. To make things ""easier"", now you have central control of percentage spending, which might be great for running huge galaxies with hundreds of worlds, but is really annoying and inefficient for players like me who prefer a small, cosy, well-managed galaxy with only a dozen worlds to worry about. At the least, there should have been an option to turn off the centralized socialism and allow individual planets to be managed very differently. Right now, the system is unwieldly and gives a big advantage to the computer.

The interface is cluttered, opposite to what other reviewers said (then again almost anything is an improvement over MOO3). A lot of the space on the screen is wasted on flavor text and borders, as opposed to giving you the info you need fast and easily.

Tiling in the world screen is not that meaningful, except for occasional bonuses. It seems like a waste of space. All I need to know is how many slots I still have in that planet and what I can build there. At least MOO2 did that for you automatically and you did not have to spend time on it and it was drawn far more beautifully than just Dune-type slabs that look 10 years old.

Combat system is primitive compared to MOO2, and even to MOO1 (which is over 10 years old now). It is also idiotic. So, if I have 100 lasers on a ship, each having 2 beam attack, my minimal damage is still 1? You must be joking! Also, one of the great features of the MOO series was that you could fight cleverly with inferior ships and still win. Guess what, you cannot here, because combat is automated. You get to watch the video and cannot do anything. Good job, guys, you really nailed it. Grrr.

The tech tree is unnecessarily cross-linked. Why would an advance in a remote field have to be a pre-requisite for an advance that you want? What if my playing style essentially ignores certain applications? Why do I have to research all this worthless junk before I am allowed to research what I want? MOO1 did a fantastic job in decoupling the research directions. As a result, MOO1 has some amazing games where you would have to really change stategy to compensate for tech tree randomization, e.g. having your superdreadnoughts still crawl at warp 1 because nobody in the galaxy was offered advanced engines. That was a big addition to replayability because individual games could differ enormously. Here, you do not get that and tech advances would be the same all the time.

Furthermore, tech tree does not tell you simple things like:""What do I have to research to get medium hulls?"" If you have a system of research prerequisites, you also have to put in a system that allows the player to answer questions like that quickly and easily. Instead, there is a big tech tree screen that cannot be scrolled quickly and cannot be zoomed out, and where tech is shown as a single-word box with no description. You have to do a lot of clicking back and forth before you can eek out the info you need, if you are patient enough. Way to shoot yourselves in the foot, developers. How about a decoupled system like MOO1? In addition, your huge empire can research only one thing at a time. Why? Why? WHY? Different does not mean better.

What is the point of borders, if at any time anyone can cross them without going to war? MOO1 and MOO2 did a far better job in that.

Morale is poorly implemented and makes little sense. If you are fighting for your very survival, I find it hard to believe your population will be that concerned with entertainment networks. To my knowledge, there is no 4X game that has tried and succeeded in implementing morale properly. So, the better games are the ones that leave it out of the equation, e.g. MOO1.

Why are growth rates set at 0.2b/week regardless of population size and type of planet? How does this make any sense whatsoever? A lot of strategic element is lost as a result.

Why implement a system of logistics points? Why limit the size of a fleet by them? Do the developers seriously believe that N scattered ships are easier to supply than the same ships grouped in a single fleet? That system may be true for a Napoleonic foraging army but makes no sense for space-age races. It is an unnecessary senseless irritant.

Under the economic system, you actually pay for your production. Yes, that's right, the beautiful factories you constructed and pay to maintain also charge you ""conversion"" fees in credits for producing. Same is true for research. Somebody explain to me why. I thought that was the point of maintenance. Also, under imperial dictatorships, why would you pay for something you own already? Pay whom?

After awhile, all the Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, cowboy, etc. references grow annoying. Playing a sci-fi 4X game is about atmosphere to some extent at least. Don't break it with sophomoric humor and obvious reminders that the developers are all human and have seen the same movies as the player. After all, this is supposed to be a different universe that does not contain Capt Kirk and Picard.

The political system is silly and so is the constant moralizing about good and evil. Guess what, this is a 4X sci-fi game, not sunday school. Ethics is a silly addition to this game, especially since the ""good guys"" are far more dangerous and insidious that the ""bad guys"".

United Nations resolutions are a good joke for a short while, but get really annoying real fast. Somebody explain to me why ""evil"" empires would vote FOR limiting the capacity of their military installations. We have all these different space races and cultures; why would they even consider holding such meetings and discussing socialist crap, like giving money to ""war victims""? The developers basically want to poke fun at our own UN. Fine, but not in 4X sci-fi. Basically, keep your own politics out of designing a game that is meant to be fun for everyone.

The game mechanics makes small empires very inefficient while large empires take forever to manage. Contrary to what the developers say in their tutorial, it takes more than one afternoon to finish a smallest galaxy. This is a general problem with later games in the genre, because developers refuse to acknowledge that MOO1's mechanics was nearly perfect and that people these days cannot afford to spend 12 hours on a finishing a single game. So, they continue making mechanics unwieldly and turning everybody off. That is why MOO3 and GalCiv2:DL are worse than MOO2, which is worse than MOO1 in this respect. Giving players the option to control 100 worlds is not as rewarding or important or even practical as giving them the opportunity to control a dozen worlds really well. So, the real issue is one of design philosophy, rather than technology or particular mechanics. So long as developers do not understand that, they will produce flops like MOO3 and GalCiv2:DL.

CONCLUSIONS

Overall, this game has a great potential and could have been even better than MOO1 and MOO2, but the above shortcomings made it fail. I shelled out 40 dollars for it and wish I could get my money back. I give it 3 stars only because of the improvements mentioned above and because it might be fun for a very select group of gamers with a lot of time on their hands and a big sense of humor.

IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!!

I tried to return the game to the games shop where I bought it and they refused to take it back! They said that because of the online activation feature, they cannot resell it to other customers, while the publisher refuses to accept back an open box! So, I am stuck with it and cannot get my 40 bucks back or even get store credit for it!

This is the last game I buy from UbiSoft, and am also considering boycotting EA as well due to their 25% share in this piece-of-garbage company of thieves.

Amazon should be ashamed that neither of their ""spotlight"" reviews mention this ""feature"" at all. With all these negative reviews, both spotlights are 5/5. Even half a brain can figure out why. Company fo thieves"
3.0	"I have own many madden games in the past. I will say I am not a online gamer though. I don't see any difference between this years and last years. I paid the extra money for the anniversary addition for the Sunday ticket and the card packs. The code for the Sunday ticket worked just fine and I am ready for football season. But the codes for the card packs cannot be used unless I pay for Xbox live gold membership. Like i said earlier, I am not a online gamer so I don't need gold. Kinda wish that was listed somewhere. The biggest disappointment to me was the fact that I cannot even do roster updates unless I get gold membership. None of the other sports games I have require you to upgrade. That's why I give 3 stars.

Recap: not much change from Madden 13 and requires you to upgrade to gold for features to work. If you are into online gaming and play other people around the world then this is for you. For the non-online gamers like me there is no need to pay the extra money unless you want the Sunday ticket deal. Just another Madden game to me"
3.0	"I wanted to get at least 20 hours under my belt before I wrote a review. Usually I am very generous with my review or VERY harsh. But for Overwatch?...

Meh.

Yeah, just meh. It's ok. Here's the breakdown.

Pros:
1. Addictive as anything! Wow this game makes you ALWAYS want more and more. Even when I have a crappy run of games I keep coming back hours later.
2. The character balancing is pretty good IMHO. Yeah I have not playing anywhere near the VERY competitive people that are awesome at it (i'm only 25) but for the most part, if you got the skills, and a balanced team, you stand a good chance.
3. The maps are POLISHED. VERY POLISHED and I personally have not found any errors. Let me know if you have.
4. The time limits seem to work, but are sometimes unforgiving if you have the wrong team mojo. If you switch fast, you can sometimes compensate but not usually on the single control point to 100% ones.

Cons.. and ohh man are they brutal.

1. Anyone else freaking bored out of their ---- minds?!?! WHERE'S MORE META. This game is seriously the MOST addicting game and yet the most boring frustrating repetitive game I HAVE EVER PLAYED. 6v6. omg. wth were they thinking. Mostly because it causes problem #2 which is...
2. Balancing. OMG. I am either getting ROFL stomped to dust, or Steamrolling choo choo train. Every 6 games I get one that's a nailbiter. BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE 6 v 6. YES. It WILL cause problems. Trust me. TRUST ME. It's a heck of a lot harder to Steamroll or get rolled if they had 10v10...... but then that's the problem, they can't or their maps would be too small.
3. The issue of Leavers vs stayers. Are they going for a casual quick play style game? or do they want a hardcore salty community MOBA style cutthroat game. A place where people who comment (no I am not kidding) ""They should institute temp bans for leaving a game early too often"".... Now. I am not here to debate that issue. I agree that you don't want people leaving, so you institute a 75% exp reduction, and sure who cares about exp if you just want to have fun. but AGAIN. with a 6v6 YOU SCREW yourself because 1 leaver collapses the game experience for everyone else.

4. This is my personal rant for 4. *sigh* It's nowhere NEAR as good as TF2. TF2 stands as the greatest casual, fun, play with a few friends or enjoy yourself game out of these two for the simple fact it can't compete in several MASSIVE areas. Yeah, it doesn't have so many classes and it's not moba, but it had plenty of custom fun maps from the community. and that's the main thing. Community. That's what makes a breaks a game sometimes. TF2 has custom maps, custom servers, custom rules, custom skins, and although less classes, WAYYYY more choices with the MASSIVE weapon selection it has.

Conclusion: Overwatch is fun and addictive, but VERY VERY unsatisfying. Every time I play it, it makes me happy and angry. It makes me wonder why TF2 doesn't still have more people playing it (it's really getting dead in there). Yeah sure overwatch will be around for the next 10 years, but i have already questioned how long I will be playing it.

and that is the saddest statement about this review. Hope you enjoyed something in this rant. Sorry for the TERRIBLE punctuation. No one likes English anyway. MOST addictive and MOST unsatisfying game ever."
3.0	"What's the difference between $15 and $30?  Not much to someone who spent $400-$500 on a video game system.  A few dollars won't make or break most people looking to purchase a game.  However, looking at this from purely an entertainment standpoint, the value just isn't there with this ""demo"".  I highly recommend waiting a month or two for the price to drop before buying this product.

I am an avid fan of this series, going back to 1987, and I do truly enjoy this latest release.  I have collected all the trophies and have achieved a 100% completion.  This took me about a week to accomplish.  Even still, I cannot recommend this game at its current price.  This is essentially a demo game under the guise of a ""prologue"" to the main game expected to come out sometime in early 2015.

The game play itself is excellent.  But, the main story can be completed in about 2 hours even by gamers new to this franchise.  There are some unlockable content and additional missions available.  They are fun to play, but playing side quests and fetching optional goodies shouldn't be sold as a game experience.  They're just easter eggs and should be treated as such.

If you're a hard-core fan of the series, spending a few extra dollars won't sway your decision to purchase this game.  If you're new to the series, you're better off (MUCH better off) waiting a while for a price drop. They played us like a d--- FIDDLE"
3.0	The game is okay.  It's clearly a console port.  It suffers from poor PC optimization.  I got it on sale so can't really complain. It's Okay
3.0	"+PROS: I love the Megaman games! I've been playing them since I was a kid. The X series is my favorite but it started to decline with Megaman X5. This game is a little better than X5 because you aren't forced to listen to Alia's messages that frequently halted the flow of Megaman X5's gameplay, and I really like the Shadow armor which finally lets Megaman conquer his greatest foe of all: SPIKES!
-CONS: Unfortunately there still are no anime cutscenes like the ones in the outstanding Megaman X4, and the storyline is weak. There's so much more that could be done with this series, but they're just not putting the effort into it anymore. I don't think Capcom really knows where they're going with the story. What we need is a serious game with a decent budget and some freash ideas. All the bosses don't have to be animals (or plants) and Sigma doesn't have to always be the final boss. I'm sick to death of Sigma! They need to finally reveal EVERYTHING about the origins of X and Zero and whatever ties they may have to the original Megaman series and perhaps the Legends/Dash series, then they should conclude the story. Unfortunately Megaman X7 jumps even further off track with the storyline but I'll stick with the series till they get it right again.
Megaman X6 is an O.K. game but if you're just getting into Megaman I'd reccomend the Megaman Collection coming out in May and Megaman X4 first. This one's just for Megaman X loyalists. Not as bad as five but..."
3.0	"I thought this game would be a lot more entertaining and challenging than it is.  I was somewhat disappointed in this one. Only ""ok"""
3.0	Good for fans, but not as good as Fall of Cybertron. Multilayer is Co op and plays well, the game does have some fun and interesting times with optional ways to beat areas, but fails to capture the epic story of the last game, trying to instead merge the Cybertron and movie genres together. Not bad and worth a look for any fan. Could have been great but not the worst.
3.0	bought this as a present for my son. he likes shooting games but this he only played a few times and didn't seem to enjoy it. okay game
3.0	"This game is kind of hard if you think of it in terms of platforming. This is a puzzle game, much like Tetris and the right approach is needed to succeed. That said, I found it hard to control. Story is the best part though; it's funny and sexy. The special edition items are... meh. The soundtrack is cool, the art book is tiny, the shorts are funny, the pizza box is cheap and the pillow case is, lets say, a bit rough. Don't use it as a pillow, either for sleeping or for any ""other"" purpose. Hard game, meh extras"
3.0	"Relic and THQ's first Xbox 360 game, The Outfit, has a simple concept that is stuck between a confused classification: Green vs. Tan, just like the Army Men days, with gameplay that jumps between real-time strategy and all-out action. This genre confusion, as well as other gameplay annoyances and disappointing visuals, make me wish that Relic took a little more time whipping The Outfit into shape, because in too many places, this soldier is way out of line.

The 12 single-player missions take you on a cartoon-like trip through World War II, playing as three eccentric soldiers who hope to assist the French Resistance against the pressing Nazi forces. None of the characters in the entire game ever captivated me to care about the story, which is told in laughable cut-scenes between each level. The only reason I say the story is laughable is because it's so over-the-top and opposite of what other games try to capture in a WWII setting. Brothers in Arms and Call of Duty 2 capture the drama and the hardships of war, while The Outfit seems to make a joke of it with clich&eacute;d voice-overs and absurd dialogue.

As I mentioned before, the missions themselves are a kick-back to the Army Men days, where the goal is to capture as many different locations as possible while putting your guys against their guys. Do you remember how the Green and Tan soldiers were exactly the same, only a different color? This is basically the same idea here. Both the Allied and Nazi sides have a machine gun nest that can be dropped into action. Both sides have a speedy transport of some kind, armed with a light machine gun. Both sides have a tank that serves as the iron fist of every battle. Even the grunt soldiers are the same with a different uniform.

You might have noticed that I've said ""drop in"" about three times throughout this review, and that's the novelty of The Outfit. The ""Destruction on Demand"" system that Relic has used is a flex of their real-time strategy muscle. It allows you to call up a small menu, select a unit that you wish to use in your current position and press a button to have the unit air-dropped into battle. In other words, if you're itching for a tank to blow up that pesky Nazi rocket wagon, it's only a button press away. If you need to plant a pillbox in front of one of your strategic points, it's extremely simple to do so. Using Field Units, or FU's (interesting acronym), the player can set up entire armies or defense systems with relative ease. To earn FU's, you simply kill Nazis, blow up their defenses, or complete objectives. It's simple enough and it's entertaining to boot.

Unfortunately, controlling The Outfit's vehicles and shooting weapons in the game is a little difficult thanks to an awkward control style and a confused targeting reticle. Though I've never done so in real life, driving a tank can't really be this difficult. I actually watched helplessly on multiple occasions as my 4X4 Rocket Jeep would cruise right up the side of a cliff and get stuck about half-way up while I was trying to simply drive down the path in front of me. With similar frustration I'd shoot tank shells at pesky infantry units and watch them miss completely, blowing up buildings in the background. This game has, without a doubt, the worst targeting system I've ever seen in a video game. I'd clearly point my targeting reticle at a unit, press the fire button, and watch something ten feet to the right of my point explode.

Just as ugly are the visuals, which remind me of a high-resolution Xbox game that still doesn't look anywhere near as good as Halo 2 or Splinter Cell. The cartoon-like story is accompanied by ridiculous character models that animate like real plastic Army Men. There's a running animation, which is the same as the strafing animation, which is the same as the shooting animation. I know this because the enemies use all three at the same time and nothing else. They don't duck and cover, they don't dive out of the way of incoming vehicles, and they definitely don't do anything interesting in terms of animation. The explosions look alright, but every other effect in-between is pretty pathetic. Other than holes blown through buildings, the environmental destruction is pathetic, with set animations for fences and walls blowing up, buildings crumbling, and the like. There isn't a level of ""oomph"" that I felt this game should have had. The sound effects are also pretty bad, and lack the ""oomph"" as well. Where Call of Duty 2 had me listening in all directions and then covering my ears in fear of my surroundings, Outfit had me turning on my Xbox 360 custom soundtrack so I had a distraction from dull weapon effects, annoying voice-overs, and bad background music.

While I have to praise The Outfit for its interesting concept and entertaining multiplayer possibilities, I have to criticize it for Xbox visuals, the dumb-as-a-brick storyline and miserable targeting system. (...)If you want a good Nazi-killing experience and you've already played through Call of Duty 2 five times, I'm afraid that you're out of luck until EA drops in this November with Medal of Honor: Airborne or play Call of Duty 2 five more times. The Outfit misses its mark...literally"

3.0	"I really enjoy the Grand theft auto series, and I've actually been playing it since the original titles.  Whereas it is completely true that this game is ground-breaking in almost every way, these games have some major setbacks too.

I bought the double pack almost immediately when it came out, because I had played GTA3 before and I desperately wanted to play Vice City.  The game was absolutely phenomenal.  The new freedoms were amazing--the helicopters are fun, the motorcycles are amazing--and all the new gameplay elements contribute to your feeling of taking over the town.

I had some problems with the graphics--most of the time they are nice, but occasionally clipping or other glitches became too much.  The areas are also too crowded, you never got much opportunity to just unleash that engine and fly around town.  It was fun buying property--but there are bugs in the game on some of them.  Some save points don't work right, and some safe houses are useless.

The most annoying factors occur when you desire a certain car:  it just seems like the game knows what car you want and purposefully hides it from you.  My BIGGEST beef with the game is this:  after putting in well over 20 hours of gameplay--my game just became corrupted.  I saved in the mansion on Shellfish Island (which is a small island between the 2 larger ones), and every time I tried to leave that island, the game froze and made an annoying noise.  I thought maybe my disc was damaged, but when I tried another copy I was dismayed to learn that it had to be my save.

The game is too long to rent, so my recommendation is to buy it for another system or don't pay much for it.  I've also heard that using codes and then saving corrupts your save as well. Great game, but has pitfalls"

3.0	"Not that often, video games can really be very strong at the sea. Most of the time, there often misplaced, or even forgotten. Just like most racing games, they all seem to be exactly the same like yesterday's newspaper. In the case of Wave Race, it is a little bit different than meets the eye. Since the late 80's, jet skis became a popular kind of sport at sea. Nevertheless, it continues to inspire some of the most interesting games ever.
Wave Race 64, was the very first racing game made for the Nintendo 64, in 1996. The game remains a classic, featuring over 8 different race courses by sea. The courses range from a simple pond, to a frozen course called Glacier Bay. As you win each cup, the races get increasingly difficult. Although the game lacks some value, with only four racers to choose from, it still remains a staple for any N64 gamer.
While many people stopped buying Nintendo 64 games for quite a long time, due to the Gamecube, and Playstation 2, it does run up a faster time than most video game that require CD-ROM technology. Get this one, and start wave running away. Waves Up!"

The one thing that puts me off is I just don't do good in MMO type games. Since I'm the type of player who gets killed off over an over just learning how to play, these games don't usually fill my bill. I did install the game and after that I was prompted the create a ""payment setup"" and that's where I really sort of decided to just see.

3.0	"At first glance, Ultimate Mortal Kombat is an arcade-perfect port of the original game.  But as with most handheld fighters, it reveals itself to only be a visual achievement and a technological anomaly.

What sets UMK apart from other DS fighters is that instead of onscreen buttons that activate your character's special moves, the touch screen provides a very specific command list for that character.  The problem with this is if you mess with the button configurations to suit your own style, and if your attack buttons don't match those on the command list, you'll miss even the simplest techniques while getting pummeled by the game's unforgiving AI.  You'd think the programmers would list a special move as ending with HP or HK instead of A or B.

Unlocking the game's hidden goodies isn't a picnic either.  First you end the game after losing a whole match and then enter the cheat code using a weird slot system within 10 seconds.  But most of the unlockables are just arenas, so no biggie.

Also ported from Mortal Kombat: Deception, Puzzle Kombat is an easy-to-play-hard-to-master mini game in the same vein as Super Puzzle Fighter, but with Midway's personal touches all over it.  I actually see myself playing this as much as, if not more than UMK; not a good sign.

3.0	"Mass Effect was billed as a combination FPS/RPG game.  I usually play FPS games and thought this would be something different.  Well, it was that.  I don't know how RPGs usually play out, but the role playing in this game was painfully boring.  Conversations that plod along, endless elevator rides, running around trying to find bits and pieces.  I was expecting an FPS with a strong story and ended up mostly bored.

But the biggest nit?  Not being able to save during combat.  A couple of the battles were tough and I hated making it most of the way through only to have to start all over again.  And the final battle against the Big Boss was impossible.  I've only ever used cheats on 2 games and this was one of them.  I had to give myself the SuperGun to kill the guy.  That's always unsatisfying, but it was either that or give up.

Basically, this was a boring and occasionally frustrating game, although the storyline was excellent.  However, I doubt I'll try Mass Effect 2. Good, but no FPS"

3.0	"(Having never owned ""Links 386"" -the first installment of the critically-acclaimed Links series- Links LS (1996) was the first Links golf game that I ever purchased and when I did it totally blew me away: I was in awe of the awesome photorealistic graphics and the incredibly-realistic ball flight and ball-surface physics. The golfers were also photorealistic digital images. The game was a die-hard sim, yet extremely fun and accessible at the same time. I was instantly hooked on LS and as a result I've played more hours of this game and its sequels than all other computer games combined, by far.
Up until several days ago, LS 99 was my current version of Links. I was unable to upgrade to LS 2000 (I was out of the country) or Links 2001. Which brings me to my first ""upgrade"" in four years -Links 2003. After having played the game extensively for several days now, I have very mixed feelings about this newest installment. In some ways it seems significantly improved over LS 99, but in just as many ways it seems to be substantially inferior. Because I wish to expound upon every component in this dissertation, I've decided to simply list the Pros and Cons.
PROS
1. The graphics are more 3D and much more detailed than LS's: The shrubbery and foilage around trees and roughs is very detailed, photorealistic, and very dense. With a close-up view of your golfer, you can now see detailed blades of grass in fairways and greens. Sand bunkers look great.
2. The addition of the APCD (Arnold Palmer Course Designer) is huge: From my understanding, although it's very complicated and not beginner-oriented, it's hands-down the most powerful course designer in any golf game.
3. The addition of the real-time swing: I've sampled this feature in other golf games and liked the concept but not the implementation. Likewise, I've had little luck with Link's implementation as well and have found it tedious and extraordinarily difficult.
4. A plethora of golf courses: Betwixt the 6 2003 courses, the 20 Championship courses, user courses(from Links 2001 made with the APCD), and my converted LS courses, I have 60 altogether!
5. Options galore: As with LS 99 there are simply smorgasbords of options.
6. Excellent in-flight and ball-surface physics: Links has always been the benchmark in this category and this year is no different. No other game comes close.
CONS
1. No Virtual Tournament: This was a huge reason why I played LS so much.
2. Fairways, greens, and roughs are ""too"" clean looking -to the point of being ""spartan""- and look like artificial turf. The ball even bounces and rolls off roughs like it's a thick layer of artificial turf. It even ""sounds"" like it.
3. Big, cluttered menu interface: The condensed and organized interface of LS 99 makes 2003's look like a homecrafted Kindergarten design.
4. Extremely ponderous load times: On my 1.7 Ghz processor, screen redraws take forever, adding another camera view on the main window slows the framerate down to a nil, and even jumping from one pregame menu to another takes a long time. Totally unacceptable.
5. Polygonal golfers: I actually prefer digital golfers. These polygonal ones look cartoonish and clash with Link's otherwise photorealism. A motley combination.
6. Unrealistically adept A.I. golfers: Real-life A.I. counterparts such as Sergio Garcia and Parnevik hit every drive straight and birdie every hole. Microsoft did a shamefully-poor job in this area. Even when I created a new computer golfer and set his skill level to the lowest possible, he was still a decent golfer.
Overall, Links 2003 is very mixed baggage. In several ways it seems to be a (close copy) rehash of ""Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge"": The fairways, greens, and roughs are more cartoony-looking, the golfers are polygonal and cartoonish (while Links LS's were digital), and most notably, some surface and tree striking sounds are now less realistic and cheesier -similar to Jack Nicklaus 6. The swing meter and other features even seem inferior and (close copy) from JN6.
All things considered, Links 2003 is a very good golf game on its own merits and still the best golf SIM, but with its major shortcomings and horrendously-implemented real-time swing I'm still ambivalent as to whether this latest installment is an ""upgrade"" or a ""downgrade."" Very mixed baggage and no longer the undisputed champion."

3.0	Not a bad version just not as good as other versions. It plays well but I noticed the sprites are scaled down and missing frames of animation compared to the arcade and saturn versions. This goes for pretty much every 2d fighting or 2d sprite based game. It still is a classic fighter even in this form. I got it for a buck fifty, I'm not exactly sure were these sellers are thinking charging in the hundreds for games that sell for  south of a 20 used. A good version just not as good as other versions on other platforms
3.0	"When i first played this game it was pretty exciting i liked the new controls, the upgradable weapons but as time went on playing it felt more like a combat game rather then a survival horror game. It's like playing a Texas Chainsaw Massacre game instead of trying to avoid slow moving/mindless zombies that attack you when you get too close to them.

In reality this game was fun, but it did get long & boring. The story seemed to diminish as you went along so it seemed like Capcom worked its hardest during the beginning. If you played RE-RE3 you would notice the differences easily. Code Veronica wasn't even that great of a game, but even i liked that game a bit more then this one. I never finished this game mostly due to the fact it just didn't seem like a regular RE game. No Umbrella corporation & Capcom seemed too quick to shut them down. Not only that instead of the games being fairly moderate in difficulty, this game seems impossible. I couldn't get past various points in the game without giving up & going to something else. Even with a strategy guide it seemed wayy to difficult. There is no auto aim but you do get a laser aim. Controls are a bit easier to understand though & reloading ammo is more realistic.. would have been cool if there were mindless zombies walking around but it seems that most people prefer action over strategy.

I like this game, but it doesn't feel like a RE game & its not as scary as the older games were. I might go back to this game someday but for now im sticking with the original RE! =) No Zombies!? Wha...."
3.0	"This game was definitely a disappointment for me. Except for the opening hour or so, I spent most of my time in this game shooting bloodthirsty screaming dudes (and ladies) in the face while walking down paths and streets. Except for one, singular part, the environments are merely hallways where you shoot dudes, leading to battle arenas where you shoot dudes from above on ""skyrails"".  Only once did the gameplay vary from, ""walk forward while shooting dudes"" where it asked you to ""walk in a circle and collect audiologs, while shooting dudes."" However, if you breeze through the game on easy, you're boredom might be reduced an replaced by enjoyment of the fantastic sci-fi story this game tells.

I personally would have preferred this game as a book, but the visuals are nice, and the story is worth the overall experience. I would recommend this game to people, but only if played on easy, otherwise they might be bogged down by boring, generic shooter gameplay. Boring gameplay, but a great story!"
3.0	"Let's get the audio out of the way: it's awesome. Cannot level any complaints there. If you're looking for a crystal clear gaming audio experience with your PS4, Mac or PC, then you get that part of your money's worth with these headphones.

But I want to address some of the drawbacks that should make you think twice before buying these...

Despite this being a very comfortable headset, I agree with other reviewers for this model (and other models) that they do not adjust well to larger heads. My partner's head is on the larger size (a touch smaller than a size 8) he noted that the adjustable band on the inside was maxed out in order to have the headphones sit properly.

Though these are marketed to the gaming crowd, it's surprising that they are limited to only USB compatible gaming devices. If you're going to drop $150 on headphones, you might want them to be more on-the-go. I searched high and low for some kind of audio adapter that would allow this headset to work with my Apple or Android devices and I had no luck. Most of the adapters are limited to data transfer. What I did find were a ton of adapters that would allow a headset with one or two traditional plugs to work with a USB port. But where the heck is something the adapts this USB plug to a micro plug or Apple plug?

I mean what's the point of the LED illumination if you're stuck at home, alone playing? Pointless perk. Sure you can take your computer to a coffee shop, but really, I'm not sure the designers of this headset truly thought about the desires of the group their marketing too.

One more point that isn't listed on the product page anywhere: the cord is  5ft long. Okay, this isn't a deal breaker if you're on your computer or you plug the headphones into the PS4 controller, but it just seems like info a consumer might want to know.

Oh, and did I mention there's no volume control on the headset. Again, this doesn't matter to some, but it might to others.

Overall, this is a VERY good headset for a VERY specific and limited use. If you have a VERY  specific need that aligns with what this headset offers, then you'll be happy...as long as your head isn't too big. If they meet all of your needs then they are great...otherwise limited"

3.0	"I am a long time fan of Mahjong, been playing it for years. I picked up this game, popped it in my 3DS and started playing it and I thought it was awesome!!! After a while the levels got harder and I noticed they were timed. I went into the options to turn off the timed feature and found out you cannot turn off the timed feature until after you beat the level, that did it for me!!!

I am a casual player and to me Mahjong has always been a casual game to relax with. Knowing that it is timed and having to rush to beat the clock really killed this game for me!! Why not make it the gamer's choice to play it timed or not. Having it set so you can take it off the timed feature after you beat it, does not make sense to me. Good luck first timers!

3.0	I bought this game as one of my first Wii experiences.  I knew not to expect any experiences that were similar to other Tony Hawk games.  That was fine with me.  It has been the over complexity of other Hawk games that has kept me from getting to engrossed in them.  When I first started playing this game I realized the title made a lot of sense.  The general intent of this game is to race downhill.  You have the ability to do some simple skating moves like grinding and making trick jumps.  This game began to remind me of a downgraded SSX and not of a skating title.  It was hard to really get into the game since the controls are so simple and the courses seem very short.  I began to realize this game is mainly intended for children.  Not eleven or twelve year old children but children who are probably between five and eight.  The simple moves and easy play make this a good title for younger children.  The soundtrack in this game is decent but that is about the only excellent thing I can say.  The graphics are lackluster and some of the animations are silly.  I would have to say if you like simple games or have younger children this should be a good title. Lacking in many things except simplicity

3.0	"Disclaimer: for those of you who think a review for this game is meaningful and helpful when it consists of one line of ""Great game"", ""Arrived on time"", ""My grandson loves playing it"", etc, and nothing more, then this review is not for you.

This review is for those who like to buy sports videogames to play through a season with their favorite team, playing against the CPU, and for the occasional game head-to head with a friend. So this will only deal with playing The Show 2016 in franchise/season mode vs: the CPU, emphasizing gameplay pros and cons, and comparing the 2016 version to previous years- I have offered similar reviews every year for this game series since it first came out many years ago, and I buy it to play through a full season (Spring training games, regular season , and hopefully playoffs) with my hometown Chicago White Sox, playing solitaire vs: the CPU. This review will therefore also not comment on any of the other game modes available for this game, and this review is also only for the game on the PS3 version (careful to note that, as a lot of comments lauding this game out there only refer to the PS4 version).

First, the good things about the 2016 game for the PS3- both old and new:

1- graphics: always have been stellar, and remain that way again. They create a very nice ballpark atmosphere, with beautiful weather/lighting changes as a game progresses, reasonable varied crowd animations and noises/hometown chants, and fairly spot-on individual player models and player animations- many distinctive player batting stances and pitching motions are recreated, and add to the enjoyment of the game. I can't really say that much LOOKS different again this year (see below, however, for how it PLAYS out), as the graphical aspects of this game have always been stellar, and haven't needed any tinkering with or improvement for many years. Suffice it to say, you don't need to upgrade to a PS4, if all you want is great graphics- the PS3 version is just fine that way.

2- Editability: once again, you can create and edit just about any aspect of players that you would like- including their ratings for a number of aspects of performance (ie: contact abilities, power ratings, speed, base-stealing prowess, pitcher's repetoires and pitch speeds, ad infinitum)- but you might want to take a close look at many of the ratings that come with the game out-of-the-box, as once again, many of the given player ratings in various performance categories are way off, from the real player's career stats. Another nice feature, present in every year's game (which for some unknown reason, not all sports videogames have) is the ability to save any game in progress, to play later, as well as a fast-forwarding option that allows you to move to any future inning at your whim. And when you are getting hammered in a game where the CPU has taken over (see below), it's worth your while to just forward ahead to the end of the game: trust me, it will save you a lot of aggravation. The game again has a number of options for levels of difficulty, numerous options for gameplay controls for hitting, fielding, and pitching (you can again mix-and-match these options, so you can pitch on one level, hit on another, etc), and a large selection of sliders to tweak numerous things to affect gameplay (some seem to have more impact than others), such as human and CPU hitting sliders for contact, power, solid hits, foul balls, etc, and sliders to alter pitch speed, pitcher control and consistency, base-runner speeds and stealing abilities, and fielding/throwing/reaction times. All of this is basically unchanged from last year, however, though they have now split pitch speed sliders into fastball and off-speed pitches, so you can tweak the speed independently for both (the pitch speed for fastballs, even with slider settings set for this to be slow, is still plenty quick).

3- They finally have fixed a couple of the more ridiculous gameplay flaws that have been in this game for many years, and IMO, this alone makes this year's game much more fun to play than last year: they seem to have eliminated the wild pick-off throw to first-base, where the pitcher used to sail the ball into the stands behind first-base (and they did that A LOT), and they have also now brought back the human player's ability to pick a CPU runner off a base (TOTALLY absent last year). WHY it took then so long (years) to fix these simple things, however, remains a mystery- as you know people had complained, a lot.

Unfortunately, after having now played about 80+ games so far this year, that is about the extent of the positives, compared to previous game versions. The negatives, both old and new, remain legion, as follows: I am not offering a personal opinion here, mind you, but just describing gameplay events that I have seen many times already- I'll leave it to the reader to decide whether you think the following things allow anyone to give this game a 5-star rating:

1- MULTIPLE random freezes, way more than any previous game version. The most annoying of which is, most often during the second of a three game series, and ALWAYS after one out is made in the bottom of the fourth inning, when a screen pops up to show you the pitching matchups for the next game, the screen will freeze: you will see the players moving about normally on the screen, but you will be unable to exit this screen in any way- you cannot save it at this point and start again, and you cannot even exit this screen. Your only option is to exit the game, and start the game all over again. My only other way of dealing with this is to save the game before the bottom of the fourth inning starts, and then start it again, and just have to fast-forward to the top of the fifth inning. So you lose control of the game for the bottom of the fourth (under CPU control with the fast-forward), but at least you can then resume the game in the top of the fifth, and the rest of the game will play without incident. REALLY annoying, though-I suppose someone may patch this, but as I do not use on-line features, it won't help me any.

There are also many minor transient freezes within any game- the most common of which is after a batter first makes contact hitting a ground ball: there will be a brief freeze as the ball leaves the bat, but fortunately it doesn't seem to affect the rest of the play- just a visual glitch. I have a friend who just told me he had the game randomly freeze on him during another inning, right after he had hit a home run to take a lead- and all he could do was quit the game and start over. Great.

2- Super-fast catchers still: on any ball chopped in front of the plate, ANY catcher (no matter how slow) will be out of his crouch and fielding/throwing the ball in a microsecond, and often is able to do that AND tag the hitter as he is leaving the box to run to first- RIGHT! You see that ALL the time in real MLB games, don't you????? Also, once these amazingly quick catchers field the ball, they now ALL are routinely able to get off an equally lightning-quick throw to any base, from any body position- and this is not just from the elite fielding catchers in the MLB, but ANY and ALL catchers. Last year, they usually did the double-pump thing (see outfielder double-pump, below), so many chops in front of the plate went for ""hits"", due to the slow throws to the base. Not anymore- now any catcher can make a throw off balance, on one foot, falling away from the base, etc, etc...... Once again, it's all or nothing- seems to be the SOP for how the game developers make ""changes"" to the gameplay.

3-Outfielders routinely will double-clutch after fielding a ball, before you can make them throw to a base. This one will frequently cost you runs, too, as you are trying to get off a quick throw to nail a runner trying to advance to a base, but NOTHING you do with the gamepad will make the guy throw any quicker than what the program allows, which is REAL SLOW. I have found that the only way to get a throw off faster is to take a couple of quick running steps towards the infield, as soon as you field the ball- this will then allow the OFer to throw without the silly double-clutch thing. And BTW, ANY outfielder, even the elite ones, will do this, A LOT.

Another outfielder animation has been ""fixed"" this year, but this one didn't affect gameplay, and still doesn't, but it still looks pretty silly: last year, on routine throws back into second base, after a hit to the outfield, where no runner was trying to advance to second base, the routine throws would usually pull the guy taking the throw 15 feet off the base, and he'd have to lunge just to keep the throw from sailing away wildly. So how did they choose to ""fix"" this this year? Now ALL these throws, from ANY outfielder, from ANY spot on the field (even from the warning track) are ALWAYS right on the base, about one foot off the ground, usually on only 1-2 bounces, EVERY time. Again, since it doesn't affect the outcome of the play at all, it is no big deal, but it sure looks ridiculous. The common denominator in all this? They just didn't want to spend any time in making these animations varied at all: one throw fits all (see announcing, below).

4-Catchers will still just MISS pitches that are not wild, with the ball either caroming off various parts of the catcher's body, or just totally whiffs, sometimes on a pitch that is chest high, and not far out of the strike zone. It gets scored as a ""passed ball"". Right. This is another ridiculous thing, also in the game last year, btw, which will cost you runs.

5-Infielders will still often try to make a bare-handed pickup and throw of a slow chopper, even when there is no discernible need to do so- and this also is NOT under the human player's control. See how much you enjoy THAT, when it leads to an error that allows runs to score, when the hitter was going to be out by 20 feet anyway.

6-Very broken base-running controls, STILL (this hasn't improved in years, maybe never). The worst of which is the L1-L2 buttons, to either advance or retreat a base-runner, are incredibly unresponsive- you will be mashing on the button to get a guy to either advance or get back to a base, but he will not do so in any reasonable length of time- and guess what? This ALSO will cost you runs. Annoying also in this regard is when you can see that a ball hit will drop for a hit, and you want to advance your base-runner immediately, but the CPU default is often to have the runner either hold, or even move back to the base first, and NOTHING you do with your gamepad can over-ride this. Very dumb.

7- they have unfortunately brought back the OLE! move on balls hit hard at the first or third basemen- where even what should be routine outs will whistle past your fielder, and the guy acts like he is mainly just trying to get out of the way. AGAIN, nothing you can do to prevent this, and it will cost you runs.

8- a new base-running glitch this year (as if they needed more in that category): baserunners will not infrequently try to advance a base, when you have given NO such command to do so with your gamepad. The guy is usually out by a mile, of course, and how about this? it will cost you runs.

9-Still no collision graphics, so you can run fielders into walls to catch fly balls and pop-ups with impunity, and no fear of player injury, either. However, when any fielder gets a ball running towards a wall, it will take the guy FOREVER to be able to recover enough to make a throw. More runs.

10-Though the pick-off mechanism is better (see above), it is still WAY to easy to steal second base vs: the CPU, even with slider adjustments to make stealing harder. All you need do is not take any extra lead (pick-offs happen only when you try that), then push the L2/advance a base button, so your runner will break as the pitcher starts his motion to home. So far in 45 season/franchise games with the White Sox, I have stolen 62 bases, with a success rate of about 88%. The only way to make this somewhat more realistic is to turn the sliders for runner speed and base-stealing ability way, way down. Oh, and though they HAVE made it possible again to pick a runner off a base, especially first base, they now have the CPU runner respond in ONLY one way: by trying for second base, so all you have to do is have your first-baseman get it to second after he catches the pick-off throw, and the guy is usually out by a mile. I haven't yet seen a CPU runner picked off first in the way that you usually seen in the real MLB: by diving back into first. Another new thing in the stealing department is the CPU catcher will now frequently just hold the ball, and not even attempt a throw, sometimes when it isn't all that obvious that the base will be stolen, too.

11- WAY to many errors- I have ALL the sliders for errors, for both human and CPU, set to ZERO, and there still are random throwing and fielding errors, and it's not just the bad fielders again, either. I've had Austin Jackson, an above-average outfielder, already just plain DROP 4 routine fly balls, in only about 30 games he's been in.

12- WAY too frequent injuries, with the slider for this at default levels- I'd recommend turning this one WAY down, unless you want to play most of your season with your minor leaguers.

13-As many other have already noted, VERY SMALL fonts in all the presentation screens. They should include a set of binoculars with each game disc, for what they charge for this game.

14- A new silly outfielder animation this year: routine fly ball outs, the outfielder will act like the sun is in his eyes, and he'll catch the ball all right, but off to one side, at his feet, just an inch or two above the ground. Why they thought this was an essential gameplay animation (you will see it A LOT) is beyond my understanding, and it adds nothing to the game.

They have also unfortunately also left an infielder animation intact, where when a hard-hit ball is fielded cleanly, and there is plenty of time to make a throw to first base, the fielder will ridiculously hold the ball for a long time, then make a very leisurely wind-up before making the throw, so the runner is out by only a few feet: I haven't yet see this result in the runner being safe, so it doesn't affect the outcome of the play, but it sure looks silly, as you would never see this from a real MLB infielder, ever. It would be a classic case of showboating, and the guy would likely find himself on the bench pretty quickly.

However, there are times when a ground ball is hit to deep short, and it's clear that a quick throw will be needed to make the out at first, but the SS (and again ANY SS, even the best of them) will take his time to wind-up before making the throw, and in this case, the runner IS almost always safe. Very silly.

15-STILL some of the worst, most stale and repetitive gameplay announcing in any sports videogame, and STILL way too obvious times within any game when the CPU program just takes over, and you will realize you have little to no control over the next few hitters, on either side of the ball. Too many examples of this to put here, so I will again add these observations in the comments section, though I think I've already seen enough of it to comment here. Only those who are REALLY interested in the gameplay faults should read my examples in the comments section of this review.

I think that's it, for now.

To summarize: MLB The Show 2016 for the PS3 has a few gameplay improvements, that overall DO make it more enjoyable to play since last year, especially for those who play A LOT of game each year (ie: a full MLB season), and it is STILL clearly the best baseball videogame on the market, though it has clearly also benefitted from lack of any serious competition, for many, many years. For baseball junkies (like me), I'd say it's worth the purchase again this year, and it will certainly satisfy those who don't play it that often, or who are satisfied with beautiful graphics, and aren't real picky about MLB realism in gameplay, or playing on what is frequently a rather uneven field, against the CPU.

MLB The Show 2016 for the PS3 is like the Emperor's new clothes- and the many 5-star reviews submitted every year are again mainly from those who seem to be able to see clothes that aren't really there. MLB The Show 2016 for the PS3: The Emperor's New Clothes"
3.0	What can I say?  This title was pretty good.  It is for sure a strong three, maybe a 4, but I have lost interest in the game.  If I wrote this when I bought it, It would have been a 4.  It looks really good, plays well, and sounds creepy.  It seemed a tad short and I was left wishing for another disk like in Resident Evil 2.  Rent this game and check it out.  It did not dissapoint, but it didn't blow me away either. Didnt rock me like the others did

3.0	"The game is nothing to brag about at time its mysterious but after couple hrs its the same old routine over and over. If you played farcry4 this is the same with different scenery and of course you have zombies in this one. I have many disagreements with this game and the people who made it :
1. If this game is based in some Arab country how come none of the zombies are wearing the traditional clothing and the women zombies are wearing white bras? Now I don't know about you but the Arabs I saw so far are covered up to the head.
2.  If this game is based in some Arab country why everyone has a Russian accent?? What not enough Arabs in the USA to have them use their accent?
3. Why the Zombies all look the same same faces same people what they all married their cousins and now look alike.
4. Whats up with the character being stuck in a dead zone while playing the game, by that I mean if you jump to a building you might get stuck half way and star walking in the Air like in space..
The maker of this game didn't pay too much attention to details and I am not going to waste my time to find out who they were either as I resold the game back on Amazon. Buy it if you want to waste money."
3.0	fun game Three Stars
3.0	I've always embraced the new generations of the series, however this one was a little lacklustre. The designs and the premise of the story felt like a little overused. Classic pokemon formula at play here but I feel like some parts of the the appeal of the old pokemon is a little lost with the depth this game is trying or seemingly trying to accomplish. Still a fan, cannot wait for future games especially on the 3DS. Am I getting too old?
3.0	Thought it was 2 player, but my grandson has fun with it. but my grandson has fun with it
3.0	"I'm torn with this game. It delivers a great backstory that connects to the movie ""The Matrix Reloaded"". It also has about an hour worth of footage that was shot just for the game. It has a great little mini mission that lets you hack into the game and unlock several different things, such as cheats for the game and a multiplayer mode. There's even a trailer for the third Matrix movie ""The Matrix Revolutions"". But even with all these things going for it (and a girl-on-girl kiss between Jada Pinkett and Monica Belluci), its really a pretty [bad] game. You can slow down time with the bullet mode feature, but this gets old pretty fast. Games that ripped this feature from the first Matrix movie (i.e. Max Payne) use it in a much better way. The combat consist of about two buttons which again, gets tiring REALY,REALY FAST! Its also obvious that the developer didn't take the time to polish the graphics, they just rushed it out so the release date would coincide with the movie. There are alot of glitches in the game,such as getting stuck in walls and the game freezing (it didn't happen that often with me, but I've heard it happen to other people). It's also pretty short. I beat it within a weekend. An added bonus though, you can play as both Niobi and Ghost. I just don't see the point of putting Ghost in. He doesn't have ONE line in the entire movie!!! Yet he is the main character of the game? I don't get that. I, like many Matrix fans, would have rather played as Neo or Morpheous or Trinity. But as much as I trash this game I've gotta say, if your a Matrix fan, as I am, you will eat up every minute of the extras. If not, I wouldn't pick this one up. There's rumor of another Matrix game that is connected with the third movie and an online PC game (soon to be XBOX game) called ""The Matrix Online"". Look at this as a bonus interactive DVD. DEFINETLY flawed, but great for Matrix fans"
3.0	ok Three Stars
3.0	"Sonic the Hedgehog and disappointment go hand in hand these days. Anyone who played the abysmal Sonic 4 when released in late 2010 will know what I mean. No matter how many times they crank out another Sonic game Sega just don't seem to learn what makes the game great and what makes the game bad. This self-congratulatory 20th-Anniversary pastiche of his so-called 'best bits' transports across all of Sonic's strengths and, unfortunately, all of his crippling weaknesses.

The story has Robotnik/Eggman ravage Sonic's world with a time vortex, leaving him stuck in a Limbo that only high speeds through various levels can repair. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Sonic just does NOT belong in a 3D world. His best stuff is 2D. Sega have had many chances at getting the 3D presentation right but they just don't get it. It's incredibly difficult to keep control of Sonic, as a weird inertia pulls him in directions you don't want him to go, and if you get the timing wrong just once you'll pretty much have to quit the level and start over as you're always being judged on speed; something that this game consistently prevents you from achieving. Even with the 2D sections in this game they don't seem to understand that hurtling the character down a declination at a furious speed, the screen unable to keep up with him, only to hit an unforeseeable dead end, is ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING!

My biggest complaint is one which ALL Sonic fans will be familiar with. The one where Sonic is on an ever-so-slight inclination but just cannot get up it because he needs to build up speed. This character, this hedgehog, is sold on speed. GIVE US SPEED! Stop giving us dead ends and cement shoes! What don't they understand? And can anybody, anybody at all, explain to me the purpose in giving us tokens that knock 5 seconds off the counter when it takes about 10 seconds to reach and collect said token? Is it no more than a sick joke at our expense.

Graphically, the game is very intense, and it may take a while for you to get used to it. The soundtrack is, as usual, absolutely brilliant and features many unlockable classics from Sonic's history, but I think they really missed a trick by not including the Lava Reef Zone theme (undoubtedly the best Sonic tune), Bridge Zone, or even a new version of 'A New Venture' from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-Rush-Adventure/dp/B000PTYKSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic Rush Adventure</a>. The games they chose to pay homage to are a curious assortment too. I expect reincarnations of stages from Sonic 1, Sonic 2, and Sonic & Knuckles but why give us re-hashed levels from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-the-Hedgehog/dp/B000G0HJ3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-Unleashed/dp/B00178AT00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic Unleashed</a>&nbsp;- games that were universally hated and practically disowned by Sega. They should be ashamed of those titles, not referencing them. The Sonic Advance games were far better, as was Sonic Rush. Why were they not remade instead?

The game also features 50 trophies, but there's no way I'm going for the Platinum, I've got better things to do with my time than play the same levels over and over and over and over. I got to 52% and I'm happy with that.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-Adventure-DX-Director-s-Cut/dp/B00008URUB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut</a>, despite it's flaws, was a better game, which is quite sad it's 12 years older than Generations. I really wish Sega would initiate stricter quality control with their mascot. The one thing that brings Sonic down again and again is the controls (and frequent agonizing slowness).

Pros:

Lots of sunshine, blue skies.
Brilliant soundtrack by Jun Senoue.

Cons:

Unresponsive, sluggish controls.
Lots of slow sections.

3.0	"They lead you to beleive that this game is a combination of boardwalk games (wack a mole..toss a ball) and ""rides"" you can go on.  There are five ""themes"" to the park. you play games (at each theme..one is always free) you do well enough and you are awarded tickets to play at other games.  the goal is to ""Purchase"" all the toys at the themes vender unlocking the ""Ride"" which turns into yet another competition game.  Like I said, its ok. but not great. ok but not great"
3.0	The left joystick broke on the one that came with my system. I had a PS3 for over 5 years, and never had an issue with the controller. Not happy that you have to purchase a rechargeable battery either. Not happy that you have to purchase a rechargeable battery either
3.0	"It's hard to say how far I actually am in this game.  But I think I've played it enough to make some comments.

The first thing I noticed is the BioShock similarity.  By that I mean, you get this fancy hand device which does a number of fantastical things the more you progress.  Just like Plasmids.  You spend a lot of time walking around listening to audio recordings like BioShock.  You collect E99 Tech like dollars in BioShock so you can upgrade your weapons at weapon lockers which remind me a lot of the ""Power to the People"" weapon upgraders in BioShock.  Add to that, the fact that you have intermittent radio communication with a Soviet doctor who seems a little to anxious to help, and this feels like the whole Atlas/Fontane double cross in BioShock.  I haven't figured out if this doctor is actually going to double cross me, but I've found of graffiti that suggests he will, and that too reminds me of graffiti I saw in BioShock.  So.  Yeah.

Bottom line, if you like BioShock, you will probably like Singularity.  But be prepared to choke on the similarities.  It even runs the same Unreal Engine that BioShock runs.

Also, the control scheme seems more convoluted than Bioshock, and that's definitely not a good thing.

It's still a good buy now, since you can get it on the cheap. If you like Bioshock..."
3.0	"single player is ok and graphics are stunning.
though game is buggy at times.
multiplayer has alot of issues but still fun to play.
I would wait for OFP2 instead of ARMA2. ARMA2 review"
3.0	I found the 3DS controls difficult at some parts.  The game is overall fun in general but the Ps Vita version is definitely superior than to this. The game is overall fun in general but the Ps Vita version is definitely ...
3.0	Ships with the 2006 driver. Download the latest drivers for Windows then manually apply the Wireless Receiver adapter for it to work. I thought mine was busted at first. Took quite a bit of troubleshooting to get it to work but it works perfectly now. Hope you're tech savy
3.0	"Well, I have to agree with the other reviewer Mr. Liam Craig here....

While I DO like this game, the graphics are quite nice, and it's a fun game for a while, but the overall game play is a bit one-sided and unrealistic, and the term ""one sided"" being in favor of the enemies. It does feature some realism, like cars blowing up while you're trying to hide behind them (nice touch), but, you find yourself sometimes going up against TONS of bad guys with literally no end in sight. I mean, shooting at 90 bad guys in one room is a bit of a reach, and they just keep coming!!! Same with some of the other levels. I found some areas incredibly hard, while other areas, were very easy. Sometimes you're killed and you don't even know why, who did it, or where it came from!!!

There is one area where you have to reach a helicopter at the ""LZ"", and you have 3 minutes to do so.....Well, that's all fine and dandy, and you even have air support to do it.....EVEN BETTER! Well, what I found totally stupid was, when you call for air support, tons of bombs are being dropped right on TOP of the bad guys, yet, 79 bad guys are still running around!!! COME OOOOOOOONNNN!!!!!! Are you kidding me?????? Or the bombs miss the bad guys entirely, and hit YOU!!! And this entire review was based on the EASIEST SETTING!

Now, as much as I found some of the bits of this game V-E-R-Y unrealistic, I suppose it's got it's ""fun factor"", and it did have some great moments, but, I still find myself going back to my old favorites: Sniper Elite, and the SOCOM series I, II, 3 & 4 for my military gaming fun. They're still better and (to me) they offer more realism than this game offers!

PROS: I love that you can use walls, cars, buildings, for cover, shooting through wood crates & thin metal walls to kill a person (which is very realistic), the ability to throw grenades back to the bad guys, the weapons are quite realistic, sniping is fun...etc...

CONS: Many areas could have been improved on. Way too many bad guys in many areas, certain sections were just way too hard, yet, others were quite easy. If you set a game on ""Easy"" or ""Hard"" it should be the same throughout the entire game. Not INCREDIBLY hard, and easy at the same time.

Now, I can not review the online game play, since I do not use any of my PS systems for online play, (I just don't have the time) hehe

I would however, like to see a new PS3 version of SOCOM (please!) and bring back the ""blood"", please!!!!!! I guess until that happens, I'll keep playing my original SOCOM games for my military game addiction.....I guess I really love the slow, stealthiness, that you need in SOCOM, to complete missions. Maybe, this game is a bit too fast paced for me? Who knows....

Again, this was a fun & decent game, worth the money, great graphics, some areas were awesome, some areas were realistic, and some were definitely NOT! Really good game overall, but on the easiest setting, this game should not have been this hard to beat. However, even with all the things I did not like about it, I do feel that it was worth the money, and it's still a fun game to play, but I feel that it could have been improved upon a bit more before it was released.

Just my .02c worth! Not bad, but not great"
3.0	Ultimate alliance was great. Forza 2 is really hard to get used to if you're used to playing Forza 4. not the best games
3.0	"Thank you for having this available for purchase.
This product was installed with no problems.
Great battery replacement for the original. Great Product..."
3.0	"this game is verry limeted only few missions most of them are u gotta defend againts the arostats or the spiders nd few terminators at the end of the the good weapons are avalible but mostly just stick with the shotgun cause its the only gun with power nd plentifull ammo by the way theres only 6 guns 2 of which are grnade or rocket launcher nd cannot get ammo for them so its either the m4 with shotgun or saw nd shotgun.
this game gives away trophies after every mission if u complt it on hard u get all with a platnum troph.

this game is good but was put together to quikly nd rushed out to the people. if this ame was  worked on a lil more it be better. its better than nothing"
3.0	On one hand, pretty much all the characters in Mortal Kombat history is available on arcade mode, each with their own fighting styles and special moves. Also, the Kreate-A-Fighter is great for players who rather make their own fighter. But on the other hand, konquest isn't really as great as it was in Deception when the player is able to explore the realms and do side missions. Also, the individual fatalies are gone. After the millionth time of doing the same button combos for fatalies, for any character, it gets boring. it's okay i guess
3.0	Not one of the greatest open world action games, but cheap enough to be picked up and enjoyed for what it is worth. Good for some cheap thrills.
3.0	"The game has a lot of strong points, the first that comes to mind being the amazing graphics.
But beware that the game is for a lack of better words, communist.
There are no real endgame weapons (only advantage is legendaries is the looks) when you reach the max lvl (80) all lvl80 weps of the same class are the same.

Also PvP is rather tame there is no real risk like losing items (or getting them) when you die/kill someone. Also the personal stories are a bit bland and lame, specially human you literally have 3 choices for your biggest regret:

1. Orphan
2. Never found your sister's dead body
3. Did not join the circus (Yes.. I know)

Also a good portion of the human story's beginning revolves around centaurs killing people and being overall dicks just cuz.

All in all the game is decent-ish It is good but not THAT good."
3.0	"I didn't play the first Fable but I was excited about Fable 2. I really enjoy action RPG style games.

Overall Fable 2 is a fun game to play that feels like it's trying to scale to something great but falls short. It's limiting, buggy and frankly starts to feel small about halfway through the game when you realize there's really only one major city.

Fable 2 has many issues. Here are a few:
1. Graphic glitches, pop-in, strange lines running through some textures.
2. Lockups, sometimes full console crash but mostly just game lockups.
3. The story is pretty bad but not as bad as some JRPGs I've played.
4. The pet is very limited, it won't tank and has no combat commands.
5. Camera in 2 player mode is awful. In fact, 2 player mode is awful.

That last item brings me to multiplayer. Basically multiplayer is extremely dissapointing. My wife and I wanted to play this together and realized on of us has to be a ""henchman"". We can't even use our individual characters at the same time. The online multiplayer uses the same camera shared screen technique as the offline which is awful.

Ok, so that sounds like I hate the game but not really. I like some things about it:
1. The combat is simple but elegant.
2. Many of the enviroments look great.
3. The narrators voice of work is good.
4. Even though the pet is limited it's still nice to have.
5. I love this style of game.
6. The fact you can buy/sell/customize house is all very cool.

Overall it's a game I recommend to people who really enjoy this genre. As much as I was dissapointed with the multiplayer aspect it's still a good single player game. Worth playing but could be much better"

3.0	"INTRO:
This game is the sequel to the much better Saturday Night Speedway PS2 game(which was the sequel to World of Outlaws:Sprint Cars 2002-also,on PS2).All three games use virtually the SAME game engine. However,Saturday Night Speedway(S.N.S.) has  more colorful cars(though fewer cars to choose from),more detailed tracks and slightly better graphics,as well as a Championship mode that lets you save after any race,and has a more even(difficulty-wise) career mode(though they both are set up exactly the same way,and both provide enough overall challenge).

Do NOT buy this game unless you already tried Saturday Night Speedway and enjoyed it,or you like to play the Time Trial mode,(like in Toca Race Driver 2 and 3) and POST your Passwords to an Online Leaderboard(sprintcarsthegame).Just regular dialup is needed to post them. I'm only addicted to the time trial mode because you get a password that you can enter online at (sprintcarsthegame) and compare your times with everyone else. You can't actually race online,though.

Take one look at the online leaderboard,and you'll see why I'm hooked. You can organize it in so many ways,it's amazing. The only thing it's missing is what country everyone's from. All you do is enter in the 10 digit password(and your user name) and it automatically knows what game system you used(PS2 or Pc).

IMPORTANT LEADERBOARD NOTE:Currently(August 24,2006),for some reason,if you want to search for the posted lap times by a specific User Name on this Online Leaderboard,you must put a single apostrophe,both in front of and after the user name you're searching for in the User Name box. For example: 'Poker Face'
If you just type in the user name(Poker Face or whatever),without the apostrophe's,you'll usually get an error message. It wasn't like this when it first appeared online,so maybe someone is trying to hack into the site. That's why sometimes when you post your password,it now shows you a syntax error page,rather than going to a page that shows all your previous posted lap times. The passwords you enter will still be saved to the site's Leaderboard,even if you see the syntax error page(if you enter that same password again it will say don't enter the same password,so that's how you can quickly tell it was accepted previously).However,if you do get sent to the syntax error page(eventually they'll probably fix it), just go back to the previous page and click Leaderboard. Then you can search as usual for various track times,etc. Seems complicated,but this only recently started happening,and everything still works anyway.

If you like arcade  style racing games(though both games allow lots of tuning choices), but have NO desire to post your best lap times to the online leaderboard,then you should just buy Saturday Night Speedway(has 19 tracks-only 5 of which are not in the Sprint Car game).Saturday Night Speedway only has Pro Stock,Midget and Late Model car classes,but the cars are more colorful,and all the modes(except for time trial)are better than the Sprint Cars:Road to Knoxville game! It has 5 tracks that Sprint Cars doesn't have and it has all the same 6 fantasy tracks(they only changed  the track names) in better color! Sprint Cars:Road to Knoxville has 21 tracks,but only 7 of them(all ovals) are NOT in  the Saturday Night Speedway game(most of the track names were changed,so don't be fooled).

Both games have a bumper  and  OK cockpit view,but the two behind and above the car views are CLOSER and thus better in the S.N.S. game, than those same views in the Sprint Car game. So again,S.N.S. is the winner. The extra  6 vehicles(both TRUCK vehicles are easy to win with,even from last place-so useless) are OK(but no cockpit view is available for them), but if you have an Action Replay cheat device,use the online codes to unlock these bonus vehicles right away, like I did. Otherwise you have to win many careers and a Championship mode that doesn't let you save after you finish any of the 15 races-how Dumb!

So if you haven't played Saturday Night Speedway,get it instead! It's a fun arcade racer and if you enter your name as mudeater (all in lower case) in the career mode,it will unlock eveything in the game. There's no such code for the Sprint Car game as of yet(so just use the Action Replay codes-only the Infinite Cash code DOESN""T seem to work at the moment).

I absolutely LOVE the FAST loading of both games!!!!It takes only about 35 seconds to choose your car and track and start racing. What a pleasure not to have to stare at a loading screen for what seems like several minutes for Ea's Nascar games,etc.

Only in the Sprint Cars game can you smash into the other cars and get them ANGRY(similar to Nascar 2004,but less aggressive).The Modifieds and 3/4 Midgets drive slower,so they're less exciting than the slippery and faster winged Sprint cars,but since all the Cpu cars are soft to bump into,it takes a lot of bumping and banging before you damage your tires or engine etc.(or you could turn Off the damage if you want-though NOT in career mode).The Sprint cars are the hardest to drive(especially in midddle or hardest level of difficulty,so extra tuning will be required to avoid spinouts),and actually frustrate me too often. The Midgets in the S.N.S. game go only a little slower than the other games Winged Sprint cars, but are easier to control, and thus more enjoyable overall. Again Saturday Night Speedway is the better game!

NOTES:
-Only Tony Stewart's Bass Master Sprint CAR is in the game,NOT Tony Stewart himself!
-You CAN'T actually race ONLINE.You can only post your best lap times online,with a password.
-Skip ahead to the SUMMARY at the end of this review if you don't care to read about every little detail this average game has.

PRESENTATION: 5.5/10
-Enough things are unlocked from beginning,though you still need to unlock the 6 bonus fantasy tracks and all the 6 bonus vehicles(Hovercraft-slow but lots of fun flipping and bumping),police car(fast),pickup truck, cab front of  truck(that's used to haul long trailers-not in game),dune buggy,golf cart(slow and dull)Win career mode several times and Championship mode to unlock them.

-Not very deep game actually,but it's got the basic modes at least and you can post your best time trial lap times to online leaderboard.

-Has very FAST loading!!!! So,it's great for quick pick up and play racing. This is why budget racers with average graphics can sometimes be more fun than the more elaborate racing games,with the long loading times that come with their better graphics.

-Has effective short Tutorial,explaining drafting and powerslides.

-Arcade single race mode lets you choose whether to race in afternoon,evening or night. Also race format:either brief(no heats and just main race),or full. Also,whether the race length(# laps)is:short(about 4 laps),medium(about 10-20),or long(about 30 laps).Note:I think the  # of laps sometimes varies for each class or difficulty level? Not sure yet.

-Has 40 week,multiple season Career mode(you CAN save after each race) where you buy cars then upgrade,repair (use your cash) and tune them. Also can get sponsor offers,etc.

-Has championship mode where you race on 15 tracks,for the most points,in a specific class(but MAJOR FLAW is that you CAN't save in the middle of it,so you must finish all 15 races which makes it basically useless for short term play.

-Has practice mode. Just you on the track.

-Has 2 player horizontal split screen multi-player mode.

-Has 21 tracks(6 have to be unlocked,by winning classes in career mode-but luckily the Knoxville track is
available from the start).The 15 tracks that are unlocked from the beginning are as follows:Super Motoplex (same as Bristol in S.N.S. game);Huset's Speedway;Eldora,Ash Hollows (same as Terre Haute track in S.N.S. game);Dosrada;Pickenback;Turnpike 42;Williams Grove;Knoxville;Brite Peak (same as I-55 in S.N.S.game);Tri State Fairgrounds (same as Lowes Motor Speedway in S.N.S game);Sea-Belle;Dodge City;Steer Plains and Moose Head Speedway.

It's dumb that in the Arcade single race mode you can't enter your name,so if you set a best lap it saves it under the driver's name and not yours. So,you'll probably forget which best laps are yours. However,if you race in the Time Trial,Career or Championship mode,it DOES let you enter your name and still saves your best lap times to the games Hall of Fame records tables. However,in the Time Trial mode,you must remember to manually Save(since the Auto-Save feature isn't activated in Time Trial mode)after you get your best lap password,by going to the Options menu and choosing Save options-then Save. The Saturday Night Speedway game is better because it let's you save all your best lap times under your user name,in all the modes.

GRAPHICS: 5.5/10
Everythings almost identical to Saturday Night Speedway(PS2),so the graphics are good enough(though washed out colors and less backgrond details)for a budget game and the framerate seems fine(no slowdown yet,not even in 2 player multi-player mode).

-It's possible that the framerate may only be 30 frames per second,because Saturday Night Speedway is smoother(so maybe it's 60 frames a second?),but I'm not sure.

-Good that can leave black marks on walls that stay for whole race,as well as skid marks or mud lines on the track.

-Shows some ok blurring effect to represent speed in all views,except for the cockpit view. However,it's basically done so they can blur everything and show you less detail. Rather annoying actually. Saturday Night Speedway has NO blurring effect,and I prefer it that way!

-Though the cars get damaged,you can't really tell. Parts occasionally fly off and you run them over,but not as often as I'd like. When the Sprint car's wing is damaged,you can at least see it's crumpled. The damage is seen usually only on the little car diagram(on right side of screen),that shows car damage;or of course after any  race in Career mode,you can see what specific parts are damaged and then repair them.

-Has little arrow like things above Cpu cars that turn green as you draft them,or red if you bump them too much,making them aggressive. Saturday Night Speedway doesn't show these things,though drafting still may be possible anyway. The first place car will also show a number 1 above it,in both games.

Driving views:bumper cam view,average looking in-car view(don't see drivers hands on wheel,but you have a dashboard and roll cage for midgets etc.;two behind the car views from bit above car,so easy to see the track and other cars. No rear-view mirror,but has look behind button and you can look left or right as well.
Note:In 2 player multi-player mode,or for any of the 6 bonus vehicles you CAN'T use the cockpit view.
.
It does have an average to bland looking instant replay,nothing special(won't show every lap,and you can't save them-but even if you quit the race early you can still watch the replay),but you can choose which car to watch and all the various regular views(except,not cockpit view) including one that changes it's views(like on Tv-but basic)Plays typical music during replay.

AUDIO: 6/10
-Ok surround stereo.

-Nothing special. Has typical engine noises,but they don't annoy me,like some other racing games do.

-You can also choose to shut off or alter the volume of the vehicle's engine,crowd,race announcer's commentary or menu music..

-the race announcer occasionally says:""what an exciting race""or ""Final Lap"",etc.,but nothing frequent enough to annoy anyone. Sometimes,during qualifying, he will tell you what position you are currently in,which is a nice touch.
Note:The Saturday Night Raceway game has Ralph Shaheen(Speed Channel) as the track announcer.

-No music during actual race. Only during replays or within menus.

GAMEPLAY: 5.5/10
-Has dynamic car intellegence(or whatever they call it),so at any time, Cpu cars will randomly crash or flip right in front of you. This adds so much to both this game and the Saturday Night Speedway game! The Hovercrafts flip and crash the most,however,at Knife Rapids Speedway(bonus track-or called Route 70 in S.N.S. game)all the cars bump and flip in the long sweeping turn. Wild stuff.

-The split times that appear at the top of screen(in middle)after every lap,show how far ahead or behind the next car you are. If they're in green,than you're leading; if it's in orange,than you're trailing the car one position ahead of you by the amount shown.

In career mode(yes,you CAN save after each race),that lets you hire a driver(of various skills) similar to Gran Turismo 4, and let him/her take over for you and drive your car,even in the middle of a race. So,it's pretty easy to win(only 12-16 cars on track,depending on class)usually,because once you get the lead,you can let your driver take over for you and win the race(unless he's poor driver) while you watch television or eat,but it's still fun. My driver wasn't good enough to get to first while I was in 3rd place,so it's up to you to decide when or for how long you want to let him drive for you. I like the idea now and don't feel like I'm cheating(even though I obviously am).Initially though, hire a cheap driver to save money each race and don't use him because he'll lose.

The oval tracks are similar,but are different enough to require different technique in the varied corners. Also,If you cut too much of a corner,or drive in the infield, it penalizes you 1 full lap('illegal lap' is displayed as you drive).Five of the 6 bonus fantasy tracks are well designed and feature many twisting left and right turns with varied backgrounds(though,nicer to look at in S.N.S game).

-Has auto save capability(except for Time Trial mode),but you still CAN'T save the Arcade- Championship race results,so must race all 15 of them at once. How Dumb is that?Luckily,you CAN save after each career race.

I find the Modifieds and 3/4 Midgets very easy to drive and the Sprint cars more challenging(they go faster-and you can even adjust the wing's downforce WHILE you race-though I don't notice much difference,yet)

-It has 3 difficulty levels,for arcade mode only. Though the career mode has the races divided up by the difficulties(Pro,Semi-Pro,Rookie)so it's harder as you progress through it and buy the tough to drive Sprint car. However,the career mode races are usually either too easy(any 3/4 Midget race), or too hard(Sprint cars),so they often bore me. Even the Semi-Pro Modifieds can be tough to get a top 5 finish on many of the tracks,so the Career mode is still mostly challenging overall. Although driving 10-30 laps with a big lead or way behind(no major catch-up A.I.,so races are rarely close-unless it's close for the entire race) forces me to let my hired driver take over (since I'm bored).Though you can choose not to qualify and start last in any of the races,for more of a challenge. I started last,and then finished in 5th place, in a  25 lap, 3/4 Midgets Career Pro race.

-You can race with or without yellow flags(yes,even in career mode).However,in both games there is a programming BUG that occasionally will put you a lap down due to an illegal lap message,even though you did NOTHING wrong! There are many restarts due to Cpu cars flipping and crashing,so it could take an extra 10 laps over the set amount to finish the race.

-You can race with damage On or Off or Simulation damage(damage must be ON in Career mode. However,in the S.N.S. game you still get to choose).

-You can race with or without tear offs(to remove mud from screen;if tearoffs were set to ON-though must be On in Career mode. However, in the S.N.S. game you still can have no tear offs or mud in Career mode).

The cars will bump you gently and both you and the Cpu cars can sometimes even flip over,but its not because of bad control-just fun and fair bumping. The A.I. cars will even bump and flip each other into rolls from time to time(without you even near them).It's fun,trying to avoid hitting flying cars coming right at you,so even if you find the game too easy at times,it's still fun to drive.

If you bump into the cars just a few too many times, the arrows above their cars will turn red for awhile(eventually you'll see cars with special vengeful A.I. marker above the arrows) and they'll start bumping you(not too aggressively though,so it's more fun,than annoying)just like Nascar 2004. No big deal, though.

Also,if you hit the wall,it slows you down,but usually not too much to be annoying. Still fun to see streaks and sparks when you hit an inside gaurdrail and everything is still smooth enough visually to enjoy.

It also has many unlockable weird and regular vehicles(in addition to the winged sprint cars,midgets and modifieds that come unlocked from the start),like hovercrafts,golf-carts,dune buggies,cab of truck,police cars,pickup trucks.

I tested the 2 player multi-player mode,by driving player 2 with my foot on the X button. I just drove around the wall and finished last,but I only got spun around twice when the Cpu cars hit me. I was driving at the top with player 1 but found it distracting to always see the moving track beneath me( from player 2),just like I always do when playing split screen(horizontal) games. I didn't see any slowdown either.
Note:each player races separately against the 11-15 Cpu cars(in full format race mode).Then,eventually they race against each other and the other 14 Cpu cars in the main race. If you choose 'brief' as your race format,then both player 1 and 2 go right to the main race together,against the other 14 Cpu cars. There is also an option for  multi-player catch-up to be On or Off. The player that falls behind will get a speed and handling boost until they approach the first human player.

Even if you beat the game in 1 week or less,you could still spend months trying to be #1 at all the many tracks on the online leaderboard(using Time Trial Mode-Unfortunately,NO ghost car is shown,which makes improving your times a bit tougher to do).

Five of the six fantasy tracks are nicely done! For example,The Wehlburg track(called Desert 8 Raceway in S.N.S. game) is a figure 8 track,with cars frequently whizzing by you just before the finish line,or sometimes hitting you and thus taking away your chance for victory.

CONTROL: 5.5/10
-Watch the Tutorial to learn how to powerslide and draft.

-Has 3 controller configurations to choose from.

Uses PS2 controller(PS1 controller won't work with this game) or Logitech Force Feedback wheel(I don't have one).I use L1 and R1 for gas and brake,but you can use the standard X and Square buttons instead,if you want. The L2 and R2 buttons will let you look left or right,if you use 3rd controller config. Since the box doesn't say anywhere that it's pressure sensitive,I assume that's why I have no trouble maintaining top speed while pressing lightly on the throttle(which is the way I like it,since many racing games,like Toca Race Driver 3, are too pressure sensitive. There is NO powerslide button;you just turn and let off the throttle or brake a little bit in the tough turns-rather simple,but still challenging-especially for the Winged Sprint cars.

-Vibration:lets you choose from strong,weak or Off(strong,seems just right).

-Driving is relaxing and easy,but still challenging in the turns at many tracks. Braking or reducing throttle is necessary for best results,though you can still floor it in many of the turns(with fun sliding) and still usually avoid spinning and hitting the wall. Though it's still fun to slide around corners at full speed without spinning out-and it's rarely frustrating,even if you do happen to spin around(unless you're driving the Sprint cars in the Pro difficulty mode-because they go much faster then).

OVERALL: 5/10
Without the time trial online password posting capability,I'd give it a 4/10, because Saturday Night Speedway is much better and probably deserves a  6.5/10 or maybe even a 7/10 for its great fantasy tracks and random Cpu car crashing and flips.

Time trials can get boring after awhile,but I'm glad they're included,otherwise I'd be ready to sell the game in another week. However,games usually only have time trial leaderboards available for a year at most,so start posting soon,before it's too late.

SUMMARY:
Only buy this game if you love doing time trials(with NO ghost car available),just so you can post your times online with a password. However,I find even the regular racing, both relaxing,exciting and even challenging enough from time to time(just Sprint cars,challenge me,for now).So if you want to try all the different cars and tracks,it's still worth a weekend rental,or even a purchase because it's so cheap. You can always trade it in later and get another game once you tire of it.

It can get boring at times,driving around in circles when no one is spinning,but I still like trying to take the turns well,so I can gain ground and improve my finish. Truly the Sprint cars are more exciting,but they are harder to keep from spinning out and patience is definitely required to drive them. For variety,you can race on 5 of the bonus tracks that feature well done track design,that include many left and right twisting turns with interesting backgrounds!

Sprint Cars:Road to Knoxville loads so FAST that it's hard to stop playing. Each race takes seconds to load after you've chosen  race length,car etc. Then you get to slip and slide and spin to your hearts content, driving the fast Sprint cars or slower Modifieds,etc. around the tracks,marvelling at how the Cpu drivers bump each other and sometimes flip and roll right by you. Don't think that every lap is like this. In fact,you can go for three races straight without seeing any wild flips. They usually happen more often in the Hovercraft or Sprint car classes. But,when the Cpu cars do roll and flip,either far away or close to you,it adds so much to the fun factor,that I truly no longer care if I win the race.

I still say Saturday Night Speedway (PS2) is a much better game,since its Championship mode allows you to save after you finish a race(Sprint Car's doesn't) and its career mode is a bit more even and an overall better game than this,with identical heads up display(# of laps,etc.)and more colorful and detailed graphics. However,you can't post any lap times online with it,so that's why I'll still be playing Sprint Cars for probably a year(just for the time trials alone),since I've already posted all my best lap times(also online with passwords)for Toca Race Driver 2 and 3. Great Online Leaderboard for Posting your best lap times(uses Passwords)!"
3.0	Kids would rather play some Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, or any other shoot em up or fighter. Takes a little getting use to, and the graphics are pretty nice. If you don't want your kids to have any shooters/fighters/violent type games this will work for the young ones and give them a little challenge as well. Not bad...
3.0	"""Bioshock"" is not a series I'm at all familiar with nor have any affinity towards. I've heard it touted as one of the greatest First Person Shooters of this console generation (maybe it is, I've no real footing to criticize), and a game with one of the best twists in a story EVER (think ""The Cake is a Lie""). That said, going into ""Bioshock Infinite"", there was no need for any sort of familiarity with Bioshock's universe, let alone what happened in the previous two games or tie-ins unless you're the audience which Easter eggs, strewn about to find, are dedicated to. WARNING: this review is full of spoilers and is pretty long on examining the narrative element (which is the last segment). Got a problem, but aren't willing to be constructive? Find another review.

STORY:
""Infinite"" weaves a perplexing tale of a former Pinkerton agent named Booker DeWitt and his mission to rescue a young woman (Elizabeth) from a floating city purporting to be a Eden above Earth (""Or as close to one before Judgment Day""). His reasons, of course, are not of the noble type; he's looking to settle some debts with some folk and if the girl is his only way of settling all those I-O-U's in one fell swoop, then of course he's going to take the chance on a blind shot.

Spirited away to a floating city among the clouds, the ""promised land"" segregated from the ""Mysterious Sodom below"", Booker's expectations for an easy bag-n-grab are dashed when he chooses to go against some ""helpful"" advice by his benefactors and stirs up hornet's nest of trouble.

GAMEPLAY:
A great deal of the time ""Bioshock: Infinite"" feels and looks like a glorified shooting gallery. Environments are blatantly set up for enemy encounters and depending how deft you are at evade, charge and cover, dying multiple times during these encounters with the enemies (especially on harder difficulties) will be a royal pain. Honestly, the combat in the game, while almost smooth as a whistle, doesn't break out of its mundane FPS mode until you're allowed to combat enemies on the skylines; even when enemies like the Handyman can use them against you, skylines keep the combat from at least becoming a shoot-from-behind Chest-High-Walls exercise of repetition. Lord knows running out into the open doesn't work unless you plan on maiming the enemies when in few numbers.

The weakest levels of the game are undoubtedly the Vox Weapons Quest and the Ghost of Mrs. Comstock encounters; one never seems to end and concludes on a sour note; you appear stuck in Fink's warehouse for an eternity fighting and trying to rescue a Chinese man and his weapons by stepping through one dimension after another. The other is exercise in tolerance as you'll be spammed with undead enemies who'll divide your strategy between them and the ghost you ultimately need to obliterate until a cinematic stops you in the name of parent and child reconciliation. On top of that it just feels so completely useless in the grand scheme of the game's story.

Another least favorite level is arguably the one nearest to the end; separated from Elizabeth, the game puts you through the ringer with an almost random enemy known as ""The Boy(s) of Silence""; their background is never is delved into, but the fact of matter is that you can't escape them. Their bell shaped heads spot you no matter what and they hound you with pasty-faced ghost children that can kill you quicker than anticipated. The entire level has obviously been created to show the player just how much they've come to depend on Elizabeth as a partner and lifesaver.

In regards to AI, Elizabeth is by no means the ""Revolutionary AI"" the press touted her as, but she is undoubtedly a product of developers who cared enough to grace their NPC with something more than just invincibility. Elizabeth's character animation is a joy to watch; I do enjoy watching her interact with things via scripted event or just standing around, triggering idle animations; however janky they might come off at times. There were several hilarious moments in combat where she announces she has something and when I pressed the button to interact with her, she appears up from below me (Booker) and hands him whatever he needs. Like, what were you doing right under me, Elizabeth? Regardless, she is the crucial life saver of the game; she aids Booker in battle by throwing weapons/ammo, salts and vigors to the player if they're in need with recover. She can't be killed, and she knows how to stay out of the way at times.

General NPCs cannot be interacted with, thus they provide little to the environment or character interaction. They just stare at you with those odd cartoony-but-realistic faces (at their most exaggerated in Elizabeth, who reminds me of a creepy female character from a Tim Burton film) until you decide to move on. They don't even interact with each other convincingly either, which is a stark contrast to how they were animated in the 2010 and 2011 demos. Their lack of presence basically renders the environment of Columbia artificial in every way possible as a result of Levine's fear of having robotic responses that point you to an objective or scripted event. You never get the sense that people live there, they're like props that appear at any given moment to liter the environment.

Enemy AI is a hit or miss; they're either overly zealous in their attempts to kill you or you can walk right up on them and get no reaction until they feel like acknowledging there's an enemy sniffing at their heads. I mean, its hilarious how bloody close you can get to some of them and fire off several rounds; some will even casually reload weapons while you shoot at them.

Strategy can be applied to the game's combat with the use of vigors and gears. Vigors are mystical powers of some sort that are never really explored in the game, further illuminating their gameplay-only-necessity. Abilities like ""Bucking Bronco"" and ""Devil's Kiss"" can be used to set aflame enemies or send them flying through the air (or just levitating them into the air). Feeling overwhelmed by enemy turrets? Just use ""Possession"" to take control of their weapons and use them against them. Passive abilities known as ""Gears"" are the game's version of RPG upgrades; you gain bonus points, boosts for abilities you already obtain and so forth. I barely used them.

Overall, the gameplay is pretty enjoyable; however, there will be times wherein you will find yourself falling into the tedium of a grind as a result of almost heedless enemy encounters the further into the game you get; which is a shame, because it distracts from the narrative of the game and if there's anything I don't like, it's when a story is interrupted for a shootout.

My biggest disappointment, gameplay wise, is that a great deal of the neat moments --- far more interesting than most scenarios in the actual game --- from the demos is never included in the game or merely rewritten for purposes to serve the gameplay in a way the developers were comfortable with. I wanted to see Elizabeth dancing around with a Lincoln head in my game, man.

PRESENTATION:
""Infinite"" benefits from strong production values, fantastic audio and a strong cast of voice actors. Performance wise, it takes a while to get use to Troy Baker as Booker DeWitt; the problem being you spend most of your time thinking ""that's Troy Baker trying to speak with a Southern-ish/old-timey twang"". Yet despite the constant recognition that sometimes detracts from the character, he gives a fantastic performance nonetheless. Jennifer Hale and the likes of Yuri Lowenthal provide their talents to some rather quirky and deplorable characters. Keith Szarabajka seems to be running the gambit of fantastic character voices lately since ""Halo 4""; it takes a moment, but once you catch the ping that is his tone, it's hard to shake. Kimberly Brooks gives one of the more surprising performances as Daisy Fitzroy and Courtnee Draper does a stand up job as the budding Elizabeth. Basically, there is little to complain about, performance wise.

The environment of Columbia is something else to behold and works well within the analogy of a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"". Everything about the place makes you wish you lived there; from the sunny vistas, the cloud shrouded environments, the skylines, the vigors.

It's an amusement park; one that holds an unfortunately creepy take on American history and embodies everything I hate about how this country tends to romanticize and erase its own history for the sake of immortalizing a few key individuals and their deeds, most of which would were made to benefit them, the true foreigners of the ""America"" they founded on the backs of the minorities, native inhabitants. You'll want to stay in until you see the back of the trailers anyways.

Gary Schyman weaves a great score that compliments the setting and the characters; pieces such as ""Songbird"" and ""Lutece"" are two tonally different themes, but represent the core of their characters perfectly; odd and not quite there, threatening, inspiring urgency and fear in those on the receiving end of its warpath.

NARRATIVE:
The game's environment relies heavily on the context of American romanticism of some important figures of the Civil and Revolutionary War era. It borders on, or rather is, revisionist fiction or mythology. White supremacy and racism are all wrapped in a pretty bow of in a steampunk universe. A seeming paradise in the sky where everyone is happy and nothing hurts becomes an obvious nightmare for the people who are seemingly unwelcome, both as humans and residents, but remain prisoners as a result of misguided belief that the other party is entitled to their servitude. Unfortunately, the game is not about any of this; in fact it, like so many other things, glosses over it, but in a far more upfront mentality.

In the face of the highly publicized themes, the game's narrative is focused on a human story: the relationship between Booker and Elizabeth as they hustle through Columbia in the combined search of escape and a way to stop Comstock, the fanatical prophet of dubious origins. The narrative asks you to sympathize with a man of degenerate morale; he's a Pinkerton (corporate lackey who steps on the downtrodden and underpaid), he's a racist despite his actions in one particular scene, he participated in massacre that was Wounded Knee and enjoyed it. He's a deplorable human being and like any War protagonist of a fictional tale he's looking for some kind of redemption for his irredeemable sins because he knows he's done wrong.

Regardless of his foibles, you sympathize with Booker because of his endearment for this young woman; Elizabeth. He rescues Elizabeth from a thinly veiled white supremacist paradise in the sky; he goes against the ideas they and he follow because he disagrees, as you do, with locking a young woman up and robbing her of her agency and this is only after he's spent time with her after a blow to the head with a wrench.

Elizabeth herself is a great example of what happens when a writer treats a female character as person; for the most part she avoids a great deal of the pitfalls that embody pretty much everything that most with the good sense God gave them can identify as problems with female characters (objectification) in video games. Granted, she fulfills the role of damsel-in-distress (x2) and she unfortunately never quite climbs out of the bucket known as the male gaze (the developers could stand to abandon the low cut dress), but the game nor the narrative never restricts her to these roles.

There are times where her enthusiasm of escape, her spontaneous breakdowns and her sudden acceptance of her environment tend to break the immersion, but they don't diminish her as a character. Elizabeth is very much defined by how much she isn't Ashley Graham or Princess Peach. ""Infinite"" is Elizabeth's story, how she grows as a person and takes control of her situation as Booker breaks down in the face of it.

Most will misinterpret their relationship as romantic because that's how they've been educated; men and women cannot function on a heterosexual level as allies without the libido taking priority. But, while it doesn't touch Clem and Lee from the ""Walking Dead"" or Ico and Yorda from ""ICO"", it is without a doubt one of the best relationships I've seen depicted in a video game this year. Especially when you realize just how connected the two of them are; it's not necessarily equal, but the characters respect each other and in turn, so does the audience.

As far as the human story goes, probably has very little to complain about; it's probably one of the few games I could probably slap on the hand and allow to walk by because the attention to detail in regards to its characters relationship was that good. Yet, but is not without fault and there are moments where I found myself wondering what exactly the writer (Kevin Levine) was attempting to do by balancing a bunch of heady subjects and one human tale about a man and a woman.

The crux of the tale relies heavily on the art of deception through all too common visitation of the concept known as ""multiple dimensions"". It's the illusion of choice that brings this tale to an end; it leaves you sitting on place just to mull over what you just experienced. The idea that no what the player does, no matter what Booker and Elizabeth do, everything is as it should be; you can't change anything. Be that a commentary on game developer's constantly declaring: ""your choices will matter"", is, like the game's ending, left to the interpretation of the player. On one hand, it's a great idea, on the other, the side of me that like some type of conclusion to my story asks, ""Well, what the hell was all of that for then if everything is fated to repeat?"" This is seemingly brought closer to home by the fact that ""Infinite"" offers no ""New Game+"" option to its audience.

Secondary characters, antagonists and political/human rights themes are painfully underutilized and almost never realized within their own right in the story; this extends to the NPC that loiter the environment of the game to breathe some type of life into the landscape you, the player, traverses. Everything the game hits you with in the beginning to give Creedence to its environment becomes irrelevant in the face Booker and Elizabeth's relationship and the multiple universes idea. While I acknowledge Levine's supposed intent was never to be a game strictly about racism, white or religious supremacy and fanaticism, its tends to brings to question why any of this was ever brought to the forefront if it was ultimately going to become a ghost (unimportant) in the narrative itself. If you removed almost all of this stuff and merely had a game that was focused on Booker rescuing Elizabeth from a religious nut that kept a girl locked up in a tower, noting would change. So why is it there to begin with at all, Levine's sloppy soapboxing and victim blaming aside? Basically, don't attempt to dress the windows of your story with these themes unless they will come to play in a major way in the story itself. Otherwise, you're just doing all of it a major disservice and ""Infinite"" does by just poking it with a stick and dropping it the next instant.

Comstock never rises above the model of ""antagonist""; like Talia al Ghul's role within the narrative of ""The Dark Knight Rises"", Comstock is sacrificed especially for what you discover about both Booker and Comstock's relation to each other. He almost never appears in any great significance beyond those two instances you meet him. Everything else is racist-laden audio logs and agitating voice overs. Yet, for the life of me, this shouldn't have prevented them from creating some kind of character beyond your prophet's quote of the day; the most I could say is that they succeed in making you hate the character, he is truly repulsive.

Another failing within the narrative is the Vox Populi and more importantly, Daisy Fitzroy. The latter, the leader of the Vox Populi, is a young Black woman who was framed for the death of Comstock's wife and forced into hiding. She, along with every Person of Color or foreigner who migrated from places such as Ireland and China, are treated with acute distain and are seen animals or some lowly thing undeserving of the generosity of ""America, land of the Free"" or Columbia. Naturally, at some point she and everyone around her gets fed up, the last vestiges of ""suffer and bear it"" die out and she leads a revolt against the mass discrimination as experienced by them. They take no prisoners, deeming the only way to get to the root of the problem they experience is to ""kill all the weeds""; everybody dies, men, women and children (this is a problem, but more on that later). Fitzroy and the Populi are ultimately the ""voices of the unheard"" pushed to the predicted limit.

Fitzroy and co. couldn't be more justified in their anarchist actions against the populous of Columbia, but the game attempts to paint Fitzroy as just another Comstock with a different agenda (""they're perfect for each other"", Elizabeth comments), as if to say the actions she takes against her oppressors is just another form of unjustified fanaticism. It bugged me, almost as much as the moment the game gives you the option of stoning the Black woman in a relationship with a white man. Only, here, there's NO justifiable context. It comes off as dismissive of the boiling pot of minority's anger. Fitzroy, like Comstock, is never fully realized as a personality. She shows up a total of two times; once to send the Player (Booker) on a fetch quest that puts to poor use the Vox Populi as allies and enemies; the second to be used as the jumping point for Elizabeth's descent from the nave and virginal character she's portrayed as for most of the game.

The worst part of it is how it's executed; Fitzroy goes from justified rebel to extremist within moments and its all to serve Elizabeth's role in the story; because how unfamiliar we are with Fitzroy, her 180 decision to come back and kill Fink's kid after she leaves comes out of left field. It never feels like a natural progression for the character and its only then that Elizabeth's earlier comparison attempt with Comstock feels appropriate.

Elizabeth had a nice perch to look down on other people from before she stabbed Fitzroy. Designated virginal heroine of pure heart, doesn't approve of violence. It's an annoying trope, and I don't like seeing it unless it's followed with a nice rebuke, something along the lines of ""spend a day in my shoes, lady."" Fitzroy falling from grace, is a character arc (a sloppily told one, but an arc nonetheless). Beth going from completely right to completely right, is character petting. All-in-all, Fitzroy is a wasted character in an otherwise great game and it diminished my enjoyment of the game a lot.

Songbird, the game's second equivalent to the ""Big Daddy"" character, appears sparsely in the game and is largely undefined as a character within the context of the game's narrative. Anyone expecting a ""Haunting Ground (2005)"" type encounter with the character wherein Booker and Elizabeth are sporadically chased through Columbia by the enemy type will be disappointed. He's pretty wasted. The most I could say about Songbird is that, it, like Elizabeth, was wonderfully animated character and makes the strongest impression in its introduction as far as enemies go.

RESULTS:
Overall, ""Bioshock: Infinite"" is an great game and despite its problems, one that I don't doubt I'll continue to enjoy, if only for its benefits the story has by enhancing the replay value. [a 4 out of 5] Bioshock Infinite wants you to accept a city floating in the sky as your savior. Will you accept?"" (MAJOR SPOILERS)"
3.0	It was good at first, it had a lot of the metroidvania to it that made the progression through the castle fun. But towards the end you must grind a whole lot to be able to beat the bosses and one of the main characters just whines the whole time, it ruined the whole experience for me. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for more Castlevania after Dawn of Sorrow, try to find an alternative for your metroidvania itch. It was good at first
3.0	"Last years title had me rolling my eyes at how many features where taken away from the game, and I was very hesitant to purchase this one.. but like many, it was the bringing the backstage area back to fight in and able to bash it out in the crowed that made me check it out. More on that in a minute.

I'm going to skip a review of the game as a whole, as you are probably like me and have been playing thes4e games for years, so i'll just skip to what has changed since the previous title? The controls are very much the same, only the indicator of whom you are looking at has changed from L3 to R3, and pressing X with a weapon no longer sets your opponent up on the table... however the chair DDT is still there... but, no toss the chair to your opponent and spin kick it, or use of it to jump off. Very disappointing that nothing has been added, just modified and downgraded.

Sure, the graphics are what they are, at first glance I thought they downgraded, but you realize it's just because vs screens show the character model now instead of photos. As for options... everything pretty much is the same, however the menu looks terrible and basic now. The only breath of fresh air was the improvements to creating your own character. However I say it's improved with clothing and hair etc in mind, as for body morphing it's really a step back and you have to choose predesigned bodies rather than customize anything to your own liking... no dweeby skinny anorexic character or fat girls with alien sized heads anymore. Besides the body size options, everything else has been improved, including the load time of textures when choosing gloss/metallic etc.

editing your characters move sets has added much more taunt options, and OMG parts, nothing to complain about their. But still no create a move option brought back. Only create a belt, character, arena/show ... nothing much improved, just alternate looks.

The most disappointing thing about this game is no new match types have been added. Apart from backstage brawl or the ability to go backstage. However that is a major disappointment. You only get an entrance way to the stage, the corridor and two doors leading to the locker room and the other an office. In their you get very few weapons to select from you can't get in hardcore matches, only a TV, Trash Can and and roller stand/shelf thing. There is a couple of OMG areas, however once you play this mode a few times, you really get bored of it and realize they could have done so much more, but haven't.

Everything else just feels the same, with too much repetitiveness. Why can't we have match options, some sort of match that doesn't feel the same as the last? And what exactly is the difference between Extreme Rules and Street Fight? Nothing apart from in Extreme Rules you can set the table on fire... oh, btw table moves and finishers have been added, but they don't add enough to breath new life into a tired old game engine.

What really gets my goat is so many areas where improved, yet ones most commonly used have been left as they have been in the last 10 games. Is it so hard to choose 5 moves via direction pad, and 5 holding R2 for a total of ten moves in each position? Ground moves, top rope moves and moves off the cell need this, as having very few to 1 only is BORING.

I know WWE will never allow 2K to include scaffold matches, or barbwire matches as they consider it something they don't want their image associated with, but come on, can't they at least try something new? How about pyramid cage matches from WCW? Double ring matches, or a cage within a hell in a cell with a ladder on the top to reach the belt/briefcase?  Just because it's not on WWE TV now, doesn't mean no one would not go ape ^%$# to play it in a game.

Honestly, some other company needs to make a wrestling game with new options and aren't afraid to include barbwire, scaffold, junkyard, matches and the ability to create your own matches. Like you create a steel cage fence you can climb as the barrier to the ring, which leads to a steel cage incased in a hell in a cell with a ladder on top of a smaller cage ontop of that, and the ring is also on fire in an inferno, the object of the match is to start from the ring and get out to the top to pull the belt down... or what about starting ontop of a scaffold and dropping down to a HIC and the object is to get into the ring somehow for a 3 count. 2K sports need to re-think their approach to these game, it's time to think outside the box, or ring in this case... video gamers want variety, not last years game which is a clone of the year befores with a new roster updated and the wrong fields improved while all the most important stuff to the gamer is ignored and left the same old boring thing.

Also, enough with the stupid OMG moves that shouldn't be OMG moves. Picking your opponent up by the feet and swinging them around in circles is not an OMG moment, it should be a regular downed move.

Perhaps people will start modding the PC version and show 2Ksports what people really want in these games rather than it being an annual roster update with tweaks rather than improvements.

P.S: I can see why they do not have a mode to compete through something from history, so they changed it to unlocking characters by earning VC points in game to use to unlock them. Fine... but no VC points for 2 on 2 or 2 on 2 on 2 ladder matches, because there is NONE. No tag team ladder match? Are you kidding me????

Get your %$@$ together 2K sports or hand the contract over to a developer who can make a game fans want, not your cash grabs you lazy mogwipes are doing. Still needs so much improving"
3.0	I'm not much of a soccer fan so that could be why I don't like it as much as others might. I do enjoy playng sprts games and sim games, that's why it sounded interesting. The sim part is better than the game play itself. Being in control of the behind the scenes of the soccer team is fun, but the game play is a little difficult and the controls could have been layed out better. Not as good as I hoped it would be
3.0	thats it, attractive game but poor content... But it still funny. Attracting game but poor content.
3.0	"First things first, Splatterhouse is not a game you should pick up for full price! It would make a great rental or even a used purchase which by the way I'm sure it will be available very shortly and with a more reasonable price tag on the used market. I was fortunate enough to get a really good deal on this game, which was one of the main reasons I took a chance with it. With that being said, this isn't a horrible game by any means, but it's also nothing special.

This game has your basic very generic storyline, so keep that in mind if you decide to play it. I know videogames as a whole are expected to have deep and compelling storylines, to keep us intrigued as to what happens next and to help us relate and/or associate with the characters, kind of like an interactive book if you will. Splatterhouse however is not about the story; it's about the carnage, the blood and of course finding the most ridiculously insane way to kill something! I would compare it to the campy horror movies of the 80's. Friday the 13th was never about why Jason was the way he was, rather how he killed as many half naked/buck naked teenagers he could before the credits rolled. In a nutshell it's comparable to watching Friday the 13th with Headbangers ball playing in the background. Many gamers today may not recognize Headbangers Ball but if you're old enough to have played the original Splatterhouse when it was first released you probably will.

As with many other games the game play gets very repetitive, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you only like to play the first couple of hours of a game then move on to something different or just want a mindless fun way to help get your aggression out. Honestly I don't really see many people finishing this game, there's just no real reason to. The makers of the game leave parts to naked photos of Rick's girlfriend for you to find, don't ask me why I guess they think by doing so it would entice adolescent boys to finish the game, which seems to be the target audience anyway. I know what does that say for me LOL. The biggest reason and my motivator to finish the game is that you unlock the original three Splatterhouse games.

The graphics will not blow you away by any stretch of the imagination; actually they seem more like something you would see on the PS2/Xbox. There is no online feature, so if you're looking for anything other than the single player campaign look elsewhere. There is however some challenge maps that are pretty entertaining but nothing really amazing here either. As I said prior the soundtrack is very much metal, so if that's not your thing then you may want to play with the sound off and if you're into it blast some Justin Bieber while you do your splattering. My only other complaint (as if I haven't complained enough) is the camera; it can be kind of clunky at times and can cause you to get a smack down.

Now for some good news, for the most part the auto save feature is pretty reliable with a few hiccups along the way. Meaning there are times you would believe the game would save due to the progress you've made but for some reason doesn't, so if you die you're going back to start of the checkpoint and must make your way back to where you were. But again that's few and far between, most of the time the check points are located in logical and beneficial areas for the player. The mayhem you can cause can also be fun, in short doses of course, it's a good thing the chapters are rather short. The controls are pretty fluid, and the designers did a good job allowing you to chain together combos. The most entertaining element of the game has to be the mask, they did a good job writing smartass comments and of the wall shtick for him.

I know based on what I have said above you would think I would rate this game a one star out of five! However believe it or not there are reasons to play this game, but not for full price. There is hours of mindless blood and gore to be had and if you're like me and have played the originals it will bring back memories. Twenty dollars would be a perfect price for this game; thirty would be the highest I would go.

PSN-Xbox Live gamer tags are MikeJMele Old school flair with a new school price tag, is it worth it? Enquiring minds want to know!"
3.0	THis is a short review cause I have played this and Hunted: the demon forge and the only thing that seperates these two games is that you don't need some platform to switch characters. The game really comes down to the fact that instead of 'one' character doing everthing you have 'two' now. One swings the sword and is indestructable while the other uses magic and the 'soft' spot if you will that keeps the game 'balanced' some what. Should wait for price drop and play this as a rental but not worth more then $20 if you decide to get it. Wait for price drop
3.0	Now I cannot say this is a bad game, because it has a good story, excellent graphics, awesome soundtrack, and great twists! It's also fun to play with friends, but the DRM of being constantly connected really wrecks the experience. As someone with not very stable Internet, to be rubber-banding in a single-player game can be quite a nuisance. I was lucky when that didn't happen during a certain boss battle (you may remember this boss from a certain first quest in Diablo 1, and he's even more frustrating to kill!) Another thing is, the game seemed short compared to the others, but I am sue the expansion fixed that. It was disappointing, since I had waited so long to play this, watching for years the progress and trailer videos and excited when it was coming! Hopefully one day they will release it without the DRM, or I'll just get the PS4 version (way out in the future, since I cannot afford that and had just been able to get a PS2...yeah....) since I hear that is free of all that. I did get this game when it was still fairly new (no expansion out yet) and just forgot to review it, but I do have hopes for the game still because of its console release which is why I am posting now~ For the PC version, it was a mess despite being a good game
3.0	It is what it is Three Stars
3.0	game play is a lil tricky. Three Stars
3.0	Not the best. I recommend the blue one. The pink one is sort of slow, and in my FPS game it shoots randomly. Its...ok

3.0	STILL NEEDS IMPROVEMENTS Three Stars
3.0	If it were not for the addition of motorcycles to this second edition this game would be a waste of time. Midnight Club 2 does a pretty good job with the motorcycles as far as handling and what not. Another good game if you like bikes is Speed Kings, not very well known but the things you can do on the bikes in Speed Kings is too much fun, wheelies, stoppies, and numerous others. I'm not sure why this game is still half a bill but whatever... Pretty Cool
3.0	Ok quality Three Stars
3.0	I agree with most of the 3 and 4 star reviews so I'm not repeating it here.  I'm not big on multiplayer so that's why it gets a 3 star.  The game has Great Graphics, Smooth Controls and a great story.  The story is not just about the war, it also shows the personal side of the soldiers life. The single player campaign is short and could of have more variety but the game was enjoyable playing it through.  upon completing the game the harder difficulty unlocks which is not as easy to complete. Decent Game
3.0	Building up your empire and getting new types of units is fun, as is the variety of countries you can play (Poland takes over the world?).  Graphics look really good and its fun to see the fights up close.  However, the battles can get a little monotonous - fire missiles (optional), send your infantry in, attack with your calvary from behind, chase down broken units with calvary, repeat.  Missile troops aren't that useful in general, except when fighting missile cavalry or defending a bridge (any missile) or wall (flaming archers only).  The flaws in the AI don't bother me as much as some other reviewers, but some things it does are really dumb.  For ex, the AI will leave very valuable cities right next to an enemy virtually undefended.  There are several things that aren't realistic, for ex, the whole siege process seems much too easy for the attackers.  Also, troops in the town square won't break, so even peasants become more powerful.  I have fought off MUCH larger formations just by putting all my defenders in the town center.  Overall, a fun game but has some flaws. Fun, but has flaws
3.0	"Simply, if you're a die-hard Halo fan and can't get enough you won't go wrong by picking this title up. But, if you think Halo peaked with Combat Evolved and has declined since then this game will do nothing to change your beliefs.

Single Player:
While the Campaign is better than Halo 3's and ODST (and of course always enjoyable with friends) it provides little new and in some cases even recycles old levels from prior Halo games. The new abilities are fun, and the space battle was a gimmicky distraction, but there's really only a couple of new weapons and exactly zero new enemies to fight. While it's nice to fight intelligent and difficult Elites again, Reach really would've went out with a bang if they included boss battles, scarab fights (a massive highlight in Halo 3) or introduced some new enemy types that haven't been played out to death over the last 4 installments.

As far as story goes, Halo jumped the shark when it was revealed The Little Shop of Horrors controls all the flood and Reach continues that nosedive.

Multiplayer:
In terms of Multiplayer, there are only a few largely uninspired maps available on disc that lack any aesthetic diversity or strategy (e.g. team slayer = grab power weapons and camp). Most of what you'll play are Forge World creations or maps that look and feel similarly to those (outside of the Covenant Ship level, a rehash of Halo 2's Midship). There's not a single snow, jungle, desert, rain forest, moon, volcano, tropical island, beach or mountain top level to speak of. Not even a recreation of classics like Zanzibar and Beaver Creek. Additionally, they've completely removed vehicles from 4v4 slayer and have lumped single player objective and single player slayer into one playlist called ""Rumble Pit."" So, if all you want is the classic Halo experience be prepared to have to endure tons of annoying and poorly conceived Juggernaut and Infection game modes instead of being able to play what you actually want (NOTE: Bungie moved Infection to its own playlist, making Rumble Pit a more enjoyable experience).

On a positive note, Invasion is a great game type (especially Invasion Slayer which is simply the best idea Bungie has had) and the inclusion of credits, new armor pieces and the daily challenges are awesome and keep the game's replayability up. Furthermore Bungie is an active participate in the community and makes changes based on usage data, such as putting Team Swat in it's own list. This benefits both the people that love and hate that game mode simultaneously.

Firefight:
I don't understand the point of Firefight Matchmaking. This was the best aspects of ODST and while that Classic Firefight option remains in a non-credit earning, challenge completing, matchmaking aspect, the main matching system only allows you to play ONE ROUND with infinite lives. Where's the fun and/or challenge in that?

Forge World:
Easily the best aspect of this game as it expands on Halo 3's innovative Forge design by allowing you to build your levels from the ground up in a massive world rather than be limited to existing maps. The file share system is great and though clunky at times, it's rewarding to make your own map and play it with friends.

Conclusion:
While there are pretty cool ideas (credits, Forge World and Invasion) the game is largely a gimmicky cash-in riddled with rehashed, tired ideas and lacks the polish, content and new ideas that Bungie's faithful deserves. Decent, but not quite the send off this 9 year series deserved"
3.0	"It plays well. It was easy to install and set up.
There is pretty good learning curve getting everything to go just right. Slow starter gets better"
3.0	"Well, I bought this like three months ago, I usually don't care about online playing so I just spend my playing time against the computer or completing the story modes, so for a fighting game is the same than all the others naruto games for ps3 very repetitive, so the only way you enjoy this game is if you love this tv show otherwise it doesn't have much to offer, besides the big character roster.
I will by ultimate ninja storm 3 when the price drops because even if it's like the second part which was very good, naruto games don't deserve to be so expensive. They are too silly for being so expensive :P The lack of a decent story mode makes it boring as a single player game"
3.0	First off, this game was made by a different company then the first 2 Batman games, but it still feels great just like the other 2... if you can manage to get the game to work that is. The game freezes a ton. When i popped the disk in at first it froze 7 times where i installed it to my hard rive. It worked but then the sound was all messed up. Thought it was my game, so i took it back to be exchanged. Got the new disc and it still froze. It also signs you out of XBOX LIVE frequently. Good But Glitchy
3.0	"The most annoying game i have ever played in my entire life. The main character has a mind of his own. Im not going to rant about how annoying. if you played this you know exactly what im talking about.
But over all a good game. cool story. Meh"
3.0	"If you were a fan of Heavy Rain you'll probably be a fan of this game, just maybe a little less and in a more frustrating way. The storytelling while great isn't really a problem at all, most know the story of Jodie and get the basic premise of her and her supernatural friend just by playing the demo. But yes playing the full game obviously is the only way you can get the full story of course. I had a lot of store credit so I decided to use it towards this game since nothing really interesting IMO is coming out anytime soon. Heavy Rain was a breath of fresh air if you like interacting with an animated movie. This game is much the same. You do get ""some"" and I do mean very little chance to roam around without having quick time actions involved. Does this get old? Well yes and no. The controls are what I would call, using the word wonky. When you first starts especially with fighting, training and dodging it can be a real headache. Shake the controller, which doesn't always respond. Hit x and move the control stick (though which one?) during a slow motion sequence. I think you get the point. Heavy rain seemed much more refined and less hectic in it's controlled movements.

Graphically this game is far superior than about any game I've ever seen on PS3, and even some that i've seen on a high end gaming rig. That says a lot for PS3 and the question do we really need a PS4, with games like this? So basically you run through this girls life interacting with people trying to find out different aspects of the question why? Which I won't get into spoilers etc. Lets just say a lot of it is very engrossing, some of it is just annoying. When you move as the entity Aiden if you ""literally"" get motion sickness then you definitely want to steer clear of this game. Moving through walls, cars, people, and about everything you can while floating through the air while fun, is also very very sloppy. When you have to hold L1 and L2, hit buttons to make things move/or possess people it's not full proof. And sometimes very tedious. One example is when knocking over a vehicle it will pin point where/what you need to hit with a blue dot. It took about 10 minutes for me to finally get it in the right spot to flip it. Frankly because when I would try it just did not work. The same with many other scenes that come at you 100mph and you have to react. If you get it wrong you don't die, the story continues, but that may not have been the action you wanted. Sound more like a pain in the rear than a fun game? Well yes it's mostly true. Also I will mention the acting is superb, also with Willem Defoe as the creepy doctor he's very good.

But there is something endearing about going on the journey, and frankly more engrossing about it than Heavy Rain. I walked away from the game only to have it on my mind a few hours later. So I give it points for that. But overall I still prefer games like Drakes Fortune, The Last Of Us, Killzone, among other PS3 titles. This is a breath of fresh air for those who want a movie based game (to interact with) more so than a controllable game with just cut scene interactions. So don't buy this unless that's your cup of tea. It's not for everyone. Much like games for the wii people seem to sometimes/most times, want to just sit back take the controller and play. So remember before you drop 60$ on it. Am I sorry I did, well yes and no, I played the demo, so I wanted to continue and find out more. Much like the trailer from an interesting looking film. But it's no loss for me. It is what it is, and it's something new rather than the same ole FPS games. Which are getting older and older fast.

In summation, fun yet tedious, exciting yet exhausting, can literally cause you to be sick (don't play if you have seizures or severe motion sickness issues). You be the judge, I'm just a partial jury. Thanks. An Honest Review An Acquired Taste"
3.0	"I played this ND game after having played ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" (#4) through ""The Phantom of Venice"" (#18) in order and thought it was a great way to get back to the beginning. However, what I found were a lot of fun gimmicks alluding to the other ND games without much substance to the first game. I think I finished the whole game in about 2 hours. That being said, it's not like I didn't enjoy those 2 hours :).

I give it a 3/5 because it's easy, a bit repetitive, but still fun. Full of fun references to other ND games, but not much else"
3.0	"It's probably me, but I honesty don't see that big of a difference from the 360 version. I've also had issues with both games restarting on their own when in the middle of a play through. Additionally, due to a glitch in the game, I am unable to glide while playing Arkham Asylum, specifically the part when Ivy invades the bat cave and you have to escape gliding from rock ledge to rock ledge via the alternate escape route. Therefore, until an update to fix this issue is pushed through, I am unable to continue playing the game.

Finally, I have played all the Arkham series several times over, so am very familiar with the games mechanics. Ok, but has some issues."
3.0	It works well as a keyboard, though I basically bought it because it looked like I could attach the basic headset plug into the bottom. I use a wireless headset sometimes and hoped I'd be able to plug the adapter into the bottom of the controller without wrestling the key of off and then back on when I was done. Key pad doesn't work with the wireless adapter. Was a waste of money but it want expensive, so, eh. Still works great as a keypad. Guess ya get what you pay for. though I basically bought it because it looked like I could attach the basic headset plug into the ...
3.0	Certainly better than using an xbox controller for flight simulation however anyone buying this should note that it takes time to get used to it and you have to mess with the settings if you want it to work properly for you. Now the things i didn't like so much were the rudders on the stick its almost recommended to buy actual rudders because the rudder twist is not so easy to use believe me. Another thing is the buttons from what i can tell they are a lot cheaper than the ones on the x52 pro. overall tho not a bad controller would recommend buying the pro if possible Great
3.0	Everything as described but the case of the game was damaged. Not acceptable. Three Stars
3.0	This is a good game but I only gave it three stars as I'm not as fond of the hidden object games where you spend most of your time going back and forth from scene to scene to find one thing.  And the scenes with the lists of hidden objects are sparce.  If you like that and have a good memory for knowing where to go then this is the game for you! OK For Those With Good Memories
3.0	"This game just has a bunch of extremely repetitive missions, almost all involving beat people up with your not very interesting combos. The visuals are clean but the objects depicted are boring and again repetitive. THe city doesn;t have much character, which was okay on SM2 back on PS2 but the standards are much higher and the rest of the game isn't up to task.  I never finished the game, near the end , I came to a mission that was just ridiculously difficult but not challenging in a fun way, just frustrating and overwhelming.
THe voice acting is bad and the story watered down. I would rather they get voice actors who are into what they're doing rather than getting contractually obligated actors from the movie. Just not very fun, repetitive."
3.0	Cross between assassin'screed and batman really fun would be 5 stars ,but long load times and a few minor bugs take away from the overall fun. If you don't mind waiting every time you hit pause  (seriously everytime )to load a screen,and enjoy beheading orcs this games for you. For Ps3 might be different on other systems Long load times make a fun game,not so fun Ps3 review
3.0	"I need to start this review with a disclaimer: I tried this game because I respect Hugh Hefner as an entrepreneur and liked the idea of building a publishing empire. Having played the game, I wonder how I was so nave as to believe a game with Playboy in the title could be more than a softcore boobfest.

The Mansion has two possible target audiences, yet it manages to miss both completely. The first group consists of voyeurs looking for some tasteful nudity and a somewhat more ""interactive"" experience than the magazine. Unfortunately for them ""tasteful"" is not the first word I'd use to describe The Mansion, nor will they find the ""interactivity"" they seek. In order to steer clear of an AO rating, there is no nudity below the waist and ""sensual encounters"" are essentially heavily watered-down lap dances.

As for the other target audience, I'm thinking of folks who enjoy the Sims-style play serving as the foundation upon which The Mansion is built. Apart from a lot of bugs, the obvious problem here is that any innovations The Mansion might bring to the table are obscured by all the boobies.

The central theme is to play the role of a young Hugh Hefner and set out to build a publishing empire. In order to improve circulation of the magazine, you need to attract celebs for photo shoots and interesting people for interviews. In order to convince these individuals to work with you, you must prove you know how to have a good time by throwing endless parties, paying careful attention to the guest list to avoid potential personality clashes. While this all works well for the first few hours of the game, it quickly becomes a tedious chore to keep everyone in a constant state of elation.

The reality is that, at its maximum depth, The Mansion will barely reach your ankles. In fact, this review is probably somewhat superfluous because upon looking at the game's title and box artwork it's highly likely that any presumptions you might have are already completely accurate. The Sims + Boobs = Playboy The Mansion"
3.0	Far from the bests... but it's 100% mario kart... My personal opinion: I prefer when there was just karts... probably the next will have giant robots and crazy crap bursting around... I feel like I needed more kart. It's mario kart.
3.0	ok Three Stars
3.0	"By the time I write this the game has been out nearly two months and I won't be able to add anything to the discussion really.

Simply put Destiny is a decent game for what we are given, but at the price paid it feels like half a game. The game ends just when it should be at about the halfway point.

I refuse to accept the MMO grind aspect as valid game play, and deny the statement that ""The game really starts once you finish it."" but at the price paid it feels like half a game"
3.0	"I've been playing Mario Party games for a long time and this one is disappointing.  The game play is fun, but I miss the old game play style.  I miss getting vending machine objects to sabotage other players.  I miss choosing options for your board when you only want to play a short game with only 10 rolls.  And I miss the mini games after everyone rolls.  This game is just lacking.  I wish they would have integrated the Amiibo play into the actual game instead of making it a side game with the same board design with different graphics for every Amiibo.  Any Amiibo's that are not in the ""super mario"" category you can scan once a day and play a scratch card game to get points which you then use in the store.  The problem is after you play 3 games on the real board you have enough points to buy almost everything.  You get the unlockable characters right away instead of having to work for them.  I understand that they were trying to change the game so it wasn't the same as their other games but they took out the best parts of the Mario Party series. Not as good as previous games"
3.0	Had lots of issues loading game and getting it to work, once installed...not impressed with it, not at all what I expected, a rip off of too may other games..would not recommend this game. Issues
3.0	"First off, I don't buy cod games for the single player experience. I only play the MP PVP, usually.. Or zombies with treyarch games.

It was okay.. I'm more of a fan of the treyarch cod's. I thought I would like this game a lot after seeing the trailer for it. I still played it for a while.. 20ish hours? I prestiged once.

I felt it was more like the infinity ward, Modern Warfare games. I never really liked the feel of them. I didn't like the challenges that this game gave compared to Black Ops 2 either.. headshots, double kills, triple kills.. Everything was just harder for me in this game for some reason.. Not sure why? I know I'm comparing this game to black ops 2 and that's unfair because it's a completely different game, but this is just my opinion and maybe it will help some of you out.

I did like some things about it, and I didn't completely hate it.. Otherwise I wouldn't have spent 20 hrs playing it. Having the exo did add some really fun elements to the game. It's much more fast paced because of the exo. A little more chaotic, I thought at least. It was a nice change of pace and fun.

I didn't really play the special ops much.. What I didn't play, I didn't really enjoy..

One thing that really made me kind of mad about this game was no zombies mode unless you buy the DLC.. I was really hoping for a zombies mode, but nope... I ended up selling it for $35 to a local.. I feel I got my worth out of it for $25..

If you're on the fence about getting this game I'd just pass and hold out for Black Ops III. It's okay.."
3.0	"...well I thought it was only okay otherwise. The fighting modes, music and artwork were all well done. However other than the online capability, nothing really stood out to me as fantastic which is way I only gave it three stars in the end for ""average"".

The characters were a little weird sometimes like the doctor with a paper bag over his head, the haunted dude with hearts on his cloths, the guy who fights with fans... but I kind of expected that (the crossdressing british boy who sounds, looks, dances and acts like a girl was the only one that completely creeped me out). There were only six characters I used more than once, the girl that fights with her hair, the gaint dude that reminded me of the Juggernaut, the dead guy who reminds me alot of the Spiderman baddie Venom, the wacky random robot, Sol Badguy (I only remeber his name because his last name is badguy and he is a bad guy)and the hardcore ninja dude(who is my all time best character in that game). To me, the rest of the characters really weren't worth having around. If only they had more interesting characters to choose from I might have given it a higher grade considering all the standered modern 2D gaming features plus the option of online brawling.

 Without the online opition I might as have played Marvel vs Capcom or SNK vs Capcom. In fact, because I prefer the fighter selection in both those games, I would probably would have overlooked Guilty Gear X2 completely if it hadn't been for the online fighting feature. Great game if you always wanted to fight online, but...."

3.0	this was a gift for a friend. can't go wrong with castlevania. before everyone wanted to fight zombies, it was dracula. this was a gift
3.0	It's O.K. I don't understand how to play some of the games as it did not come with instructions!!!  The level called Speed is IMPOSSIBLE to out of the 1st level..... Level 9 of Shoot is practically IMPOSSIBLE to win!!!!! It's O. K. I don't understand how to ...
3.0	"We love Wii games which make us get up and move and have fun. We just bought this game and I can't say we are impressed at all. The ""how to play"" indicators are confusing and don't tell you ALL of what you need to do for each challenge. Some of the games are rather boring. This just isn't as good as we expected. Outdoor challenge and Monkey Ball Super Banana Blitz or Rayman Rabbids 2 are still more fun if you want an ""active"" game. Not as much fun as expected"
3.0	"I guess I shouldn't say required, but you do need the Wii Fit U software, which I was unaware of when I purchased this. The Wii Fit balance board is also helpful in getting more out of the software and to incorporate more fitness routines. The Wii Fit U meter itself is really small. I wish it had a lanyard strap attachment hole so I can carry it that way, instead of just a belt clip. Display is nice and crisp (think Calculator/Organizer type), and the buttons are responsive.

Nothing much more to say here! Pricey add-ons along with this Meter required"
3.0	I don't know what to say, this game is kind of fun, but really lacks any real replay value.  You play as a chopper pilot who flies around the city either putting out fires and rescuing people or helping the police track down a bad guy.  It can be fun, sending your little guy down a rope to pull up some poor little person, but it gets boring.  Decent graphics and control are the only really high points for this title, and the number of modes are low, (3). Kind of fun
3.0	This only gets 3 stars. Sure, it works, but it's an extra step that I shouldn't have had to take. I can't buy minecraft via their website? Because mojang is based in Sweden? What difference does that make? Microsoft owns the company, and I buy stuff from other countries (like china) all the time via websites like amazon. Am I really expected to believe that there's no way that mojang could have set up a payment option for U.S. customers? Couldn't buy it from mojang
3.0	I didn't like it as much as the previous 2 games of this genru.  The graphics are great, but the micromanagement is a bit overwhelming.  With the addon, you are very limited with using water in rides, as you have to have a swimming pool to enter and exit with.  It is great that you can build/download others custom made rides.  For the price, it is about average.  Stick with the last incarnation, it was better in my opinion. Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 & Addon
3.0	"...what a shock after playing games such as FarCry 4, BioShock Infinite, and most of all recently Rise of the Tomb Raider! 'Run & Gun' was a signature FPS style mostly of the mid-90's which my son and I also enjoyed (post Return to Zork) - then graduating to the HalfLife & such gaming universe. This new Doom is obviously a flashback to those early (Doom, Serious Sam, etc.) shooters... but I'm afraid I've grown since then, and in my older 'gaming' age enjoy much more searching/discovering and exploring well designed landscapes and challenges (along with the shooting battles thrown in, of course) than I do this ravaging blast-'em type of game. However, that being said - I like popping in this Doom for a 'checkpoint' or two (that's about all I can take!) between tech jobs and real life activities. It can become dizzying and down-right boring to play any longer. If you like that kind of game, this'll work fine for you. Runs smooth on my machine (i7/16gigs/Nvidia, etc.) and looks great. 'Not worth full ($60!) price IMO.

UPDATE: After several (combined) hours... too repetitive. Too boring...  I'm gettin' too old for this kinda sh@t... I may quit. Jeez-Louise!..."
3.0	"very dirty and rusty and the description said ""good quality joystick"" but it wasn't Three Stars"
3.0	The price was good and the no issues with the quality thus far. ok
3.0	He's 8 and says its to hard. Son don't like it.
3.0	Nothing special about this game.  Graphics about as good as xbox 360 far cry 3.  predictable story line.  open world only after completing most of the missions/liberating towers. Nothing Special wait until its $19.99
3.0	Game might have been fine in it's day - but I wanted to try it since I just finished the XBOX 360 game.  I guess you can't go back - graphics too poor compared to 360 HD to tolerate.  I know this is a review looking back - so if you are like me, loved the 360 version, you might want to think twice before trying to go back to play the original. ugh, you can't go back
3.0	Ark the Lad:End of Darkness is an adventure game in a fantasy setting. It has average graphics and mediocre music. The characters are not extremely deep, and the story is pretty slow moving, but not unbearably so. The dialog is par for this type of game; not incredibly interesting or insightful. I recommend this game to fans of fantasy adventure games, otherwise you should probably rent this one to see if you like it before you make a purchase. So-so
3.0	I got these for use with my New 3DS XL, however the tips don't work well with my screen, and catch and stutter. I guess they are advertised as DSi styli, so I can't complain too much. Not designed for New 3DS screens
3.0	Not compatible with all PS2 controllers. Tried to use with a Guitar Hero PS2 controller into my PS3 and it didn't transfer the button code properly. Not compatible with all PS2 controllers
3.0	"D2 didn't wow the world when it came out. It's long gone now but here's my review anyway. You play as Laura Parton, survivor of a plane crash in the freezing wastelands of northern Canada. There are a few other survivors but unfortunately some of them have mutated into green plant type monsters. You need to find help, avoid monsters and work out what caused that plane to crash.

Playing D2 is like watching a very, VERY slow movie. It's really one long interactive cut scene with breaks when you need to do something to start the next one. All Laura really does is move about in 1st person mode and press a button to interact with something in front of her. Every interaction causes a little cut scene to play. This could be picking up a healing aid, looking at somebody who is asleep (and not going to answer you), or opeing a door. It looks daft, and after the first 5 minutes it gets quite tiresome. This is how the game plays out in nearly every inside environment. Outside, things change a bit. We leap into glorious 3rd person view and watch Laura trudge around the snow. Now, the mountain landscapes you have to cross are actually pretty amazing. They do make you feel cold, and the sound of snow underfoot is wonderfully realistic. Unfortunately Laura also has to fight monsters outside and this is a bit more clumsy. Again, we go back to 1st person for fighting and it's very, nay almost impossible to fight without getting hit, because Laura does not MOVE when she's in a battle! Luckily healing items are plentiful and seemingly infinite.

There are bosses that are quite fun. And there are some gruesome sights to see, some of which are very adult orientated. But sadly, some of the cut scenes are EXTREMELY long, with lots and lots of spoken dialogue. The lip-synching is diabolical, so these can become quite a chore to sit through. What's really daft is that Laura herself never speaks. She has all the other characters babbling straight at her, and merely grunts, sighs or makes little tuts or intakes of breath in response. If I had to talk to someone like while trapped in freezing cold cabins surrounded by monsters that I would be ready to slap them round the face after the first hour.

But all in all, I enjoyed it. Laura does have a real mystery to unfold, and some of the sights you will see are pretty unbelieveable - just wait until near the end where you have to destroy a super computer that talks to you with a female voice...you'll know what I mean. Talk about sexual imagery!!

Anyway it's all very ponderous and mysterious. Probably far too serious for it's own good. But at the end, I did feel like I had been asked to follow a very personal journey dreamed up by he game producers. They certainly had a unique take on gaming. D2 might be slow and cumbersome at times but it does have atmosphere and a heart. Strange"
3.0	ok Three Stars
3.0	"This one is the disappointing of all LEGO games I've ever played. Yes, I am 30 years old playing kids' game and I don't care. I find these LEGO games relaxing,enjoyable and a perfect exit after a stressful day. Usually, the batman, indiana jones, star wars and harry potter years 1-4 are fun and kept my mind off things but 5-7 one. I find myself twisting around on my chair waiting for it to be over, that is how easy it was and the game play is almost pointless. I hope this is the only game that is just like that because I'm buying the pirates one next. *giggles* Yes, I know but I don't care.

On the side note, I met a 40 years old Disney Head Manager of a certain department and he was at first embarrassed when I found his stash of LEGO games for his playstation and I told him excitedly,""Thank you!"" A wee bit too easy"
3.0	The ideal jaggerific racing expierience. Actualy, it's quite entertaining, and should not be overlooked, especialy by fans of the series. Cool Launch Title
3.0	"I just wish to extend on Simon's review here.  There are three topics of what I wish to cover.

The first of which are the controls.  Like its SNES cousins, the controls for the SNES version are spot on on the basic level.  However, this was the first and only game in the SNES line to introduce Super Special Moves.  And performing these can be a bit tricky at times.  Not so much so that you won't quickly get used to them, but enough to annoy you.  Try Akuma's HCBx2 +P and see what I mean.  Not to mention that if you want to pull off a Level 3 Super (although, for practical purposes, I don't see why you'd want to) you'd have to hit all 3 punch or kick buttons to pull it off.  Meaning that you'll have to get used to using one of the shoulder buttons and pressing it at the exact time as you're pressing the other two buttons, which can be quite frusterating at times as well.  But, like I said, nothing that you can't get used to over a short period of time.

My second gripe is the difficulty.  As standard with both Capcom and SNK fighters, the default setting for difficulty is 3 out of 8.  And after playing through both the CPS2 and SNES versions, the SNES is definately the easier of the two.  It's no contest.  After playing through both at the default 3/8 level, I simply blazed through the SNES version without losing a single round (and scoring perfects on about 2/3 of them overall) whereas I had to continue a few times on the CPS2 version.  And I'm not really considered to be a competitive level player at this game, either.

This being said, it's obvious that the game's difficulty was toned down for the younger set of players.  This is easily remedied.  Just turn the difficulty up.  However, it only does so much.

The third and final topic I wish to discuss is the sound.  Now, of course, you can't possibly expect a brilliant sound conversion from a CPS2 to SNES port.  However, I do feel that they could have done a better job with some of the tracks.  Dhalsim's stage is a primary example of this.  I'd be half tempted to mute the TV whenever I come up against him if I wasn't able to beat him so quickly.  Basically, while some tracks sound just fine, others were just horribly distorted.  At least they kept the ""StrEEET Fighter Alpha.......2!"" yell intact at the intro.

Oh, yeah....one more thing.  The sprites are awful.  You can't really expect much, though.  So I can't really complain about that.  But I was still floored at how bad they looked when I first loaded the cartridge in.  It's no bother, though. Controls, Difficulty, and Sound"
3.0	fun Three Stars
3.0	Good job. Three Stars
3.0	I got this to use with XBOX 360 Kinect. I Have not fully explored the whole disc, but appears to be as expected and works well. <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050SYUAS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img> Shape-up
3.0	This game was okay, if you ask me.  The story was alright and the gameplay was good, but it just didn't have that extra something to make the game a good RPG. Ok game
3.0	"this game has a lot of glitches. I was hoping for a better experience than this. the plot is very scattered, and they don't fully explain the situation that you get dropped into. the battles are frustrating and not enjoyable like in EW. enemies are overpowered, armored, and can hit you through walls and cover. very disappointing. I had very little to no issues in EW- not to say it was easy, but it rewarded you for having a good strategy and playing smart. xcom2 doesn't care how well you play or about your strategy. I got about 8 hours in, and it's not enjoyable or rewarding...

So, after playing for another day, I stand by my original review. Here are just a few of the things I noticed: weapon mods disappear! it's happened to me twice. I put a scope on one of my soldiers sniper rifle. it lasted until the next time I played. Heals will go to the wrong person. overwatch will try to hit unhittable enemies. overwatch will miss point blank enemies. grenades won't damage the enemies in the blast radius. enemies can melee and shoot you thru walls. in one case i was behind a building and an enemy on the other side of the building hit me. the hit % mean nothing... I miss 80%+ hits regularly. and other issues that really disappoint...

Xcom fanboys won't admit it, but this game is a step back in the Xcom series... Not a good sequal compared to Xcom EW..."
3.0	No actual difficulty, for as amazing as Wild Arms was, this game does not live up to the first title on any level but graphically perhaps. That doesn't make it bad, of course, since Wild Arms 1 is a classic and it's hard to trump something that set such a high bar, but don't purchase this expecting more of what the original offered. for as amazing as Wild Arms was
3.0	"I like this game to a point, but it DOES want to be the next Grand Theft Auto, whether the developers or fans want to admit it.  The problem is that the ""hub"" city is boring as hell.  It's desolate (which is kind of cool), but there's not much to do (which is NOT cool).  The fights are fun, but it seems like you have to go through a lot of b.s. just to get into a decent fight.  I've been playing it on and off for a couple months, but - in the end - my feeling about this game is that I just don't care if I finish it or not.  It pretty much makes me wish I was dead already. It's okay"
3.0	"This is a very good game with a weak story-line. However, there is still some fun to be had in this WW2 shooter. I have played dozens of shooters in this past month, and this one is in the top echelon. It has good graphics and a nice set of weapons, that sound right and seem to have the right amount of power and authentic feel to them. In A lot of games the weapons are either overpowered or underpowered, in this game however, they feel right and deliever the right amount of ""pop"". The game runs around 6-9 hours, which is medium legnth for this genre. It has you playing as several different factions throughout the game. You will enjoy the missions as the Americans the most, the others are very old and and useless feeling.

 Another strong thing I will say about this game, is that at it's current price it's a steal. I payed 25 and I wasn't disappointed. Your getting it for half of that! I would recommend purchasing this game.

Graphics 7.5
Sound  7.0
Framerate 8.0 ( glitches rarely )
Story 6.0
Achievements 7.5 ( good blend )
Overall 7.5-8.0 Really good and for this price."
3.0	To bad they don't update some of these classic games! Great game for PS2
3.0	"now to be honest and to the point, if you have played this title like me since part one and enjoyed each one, then you are gonna enjoy this one to, i mean i just simply love gran turismo period, im not really into the other type of racers with unrealistic driving, or dumb looking cars with no brand names that you cant tune up like in this game, yeah sure i'll play a need for speed here and there but thats the line.

now to the details:
1.damage on cars, there is, so i don't know why some say there isnt, of course its not burnout paradise type of damage but i mean your not playing a crash derby are you? when the car gets damaged it looks like its melting, thats right melting, windows or headlights don't crack, the corners of the vehicle just bend including  the headlights with glas and all.
2.the people shown in the menus are straight up ps2 grafics and people on race tracks are more like supernintendo grafics
3.the cock pit is only available for premium cars only
4.the licenses are not an obligation, you do them if you want, and gold trophies for licenses are impossible
5.loading for races are a bit long, and thats after an install of like 45 minutes to avoid this and 2 online updates of 133mb each
6.soundtracks are dumb i prefer the GT2 soundtracks
7.grafics for the scenery in the race tracks sometimes look as if frames are skipping

thats pretty much it i guess, but besides this things trust me the game is fun, the cars do look real, it is addictive trying to get money to buy the car you want, or pimping the one you already have, there is nascar, rally, go karts, there is be B spec mode in which you command the driver instead of driving yourself, LIKE I SAID, if you like the other ones youll love this one to, and this was me being honest because the mentioned above doesnt bother me, just give it a try honestly speaking"
3.0	"I went from the Xbox 360 version to this version. Even though there are some major changes between this version and the Xbox 360 version, I don't think there are enough, or significant enough, changes and improvements to warrant buying a new system just for this game.

Even the graphics aren't that much better than old gen. I wanted to be hit upside the head with a way better game, but this was not the case. Not the huge leap I was expecting"
3.0	"I have never been so angry!!!!!!!

It is easy to see that this game has lost its former owners, because the people who have made number 5 has no idea waht they were doing.

The story is one big questionmark, and the more you play the more confused you get.

There is nothing that tells you where you are, or what happanded afther the last gamen and the rockening.

where is Emilia or Halfdeath?

There is no clue.

The graphic and the creatures look great, but the people who developed this game have totaly forgotten about game-play. no no no NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3.0	good game Three Stars
3.0	So as soon as this came out I flipped and ran over to a friend's house to play it as quickly as possible. It was pretty dissapointing considering how awesome the 1st Halo was. So we decided to play the 1st level on co-op and it wasn't all that great. The human weapons took a turn for the worse, a VERY big turn. They took out the always reliable, honest to goodness asault rifle and replaced it with this half way decent battle rifle and a little tec-9 like thing called the SMG (sub machine gun). So I pick up the battle rifle and it only fires in 3 shot burst, but it zooms in. I thought this was kind of cool but it just wasn't all that effective. I then pick up the SMG. The thing looks way too small to be very effective, but it was ok. They decided to put a recoil in it so the crosshare moves up which I thought was kind of stupid, and the think burns ammo really quickly. So then I decided to turn to the always faithfull pistol. I just wanted to cry. They took out the zoom, put in weaker rounds, made it shoot faster and added more ammo. The pistol as I knew it, was gone. Well I beat the level and it was fairly simple. It could have been that fact that it was co-op on easy, but it was far too easy compared to the 1st level on the 1st halo. It's ok I thought, I'm sure I just havn't adjusted to it. I was wrong yet again. We turned on multiplayer, and the levels to me just weren't all that great. We used the covenent weapons which were about the same. They added the Brute-shot, A grenade launcher fused with a blunt smacking object which was kinda cool. The new covenent carbine is like a single shot, more accurate and powerfull needler with a scope, which was pretty cool. And they also added the alien version of a sniper rifle, which was just like the human one but used enerby instead of ammo. So as we were fighting eachother, I fell off a high building and landed unharmed. That was a very bad move for Halo 2. The energy sword takes the honor out of melee combat, because you can easily one hit eachother, but it could still be pretty fun. They also made the needler a bit more accurate and powerfull. The duel-weapon thing is just plain stupid. I was fighting my friend with the battle rifle, and he just wastes me by rushing with DOUBLE NEEDLERS!!! If you have played Halo you know how the needler is very deadly when you empty the clip on someone at close range. Now add some more accuracy and power, and then double it. That's what I recieved. This was about the cheapest thing I have seen in both halo games. The duel-weapons just add way too much power. The graphics are MUCH nicer, but I just don't like them as much. They added this strange lighting effect on the grunts, and the marines armor just looks kind of stupid now. But all around, the graphics are pretty good. However, Bungee did add a nice new feature wich allows you to swap weapons with your allys, you don't have to smack the marines any more to get the weapons you want, or you can give them weapons as you see fit. The alien missions are ok, not as great as I expected though. You fight these other wierder looking aliens that want to use the flood against the other aliens. So you fight them while you fight the flood. I got really tired of fighting the flood in the 1st Halo, and I sure as heck didn't feel like fighting them again. The story is trash. I won't say anything much because I don't want to ruin it for other people, but in short, their are more halo's out in the universe. All around, this was good, but it just is no where near as good as Halo 1. Good, but no where near as good as the first one.
3.0	What is happening to video game consoles! Who's giong to want to pay over $1000 dollars for an xbox 360 bundle, the only people I can think of are millionaires like Bill gates. Video games are something that everyone should enjoy, not just the people who own the companies that make them. Now I understand that they're going to be over $200 dollars, but anything over $500 is insane. When the playstation 2 and xbox came out they were about $150 dollars, and the games were $50 and under. Sadly, like most people I will have to wait until the prices on the games and the consoles go down. Just to let you know all of that was my opinion, if you can afford the new consoles then go out and buy one. EXTREMELY OVERPRICED!
3.0	"Killzone is the best FPS on the ps2, and thats kinda sad. While Killzone is fun to play, it has many problems that bring down the expirence.

Killzone boasts great art direction. Some locals had the opertunity to be breathtaking and the character models are verry well done. The reason I said had the opertunity to be breathtaking is because this game has the worst texture pop in and wacky view distances in a game of this generation of consoles. You walk up to a character and they look all smudgy like a N64 launch title! Its horrible. But when it pops in (you could wait a while) it looks good, if not great.

Another problem is the hit detection. Normaly in games one hit with a shotgun is enough to kill someone right? Not in killzone it isnt! You have to shoot them three to four times with it before they die! This is perhaps the most agravating thing about the game. If you are sniping, it takes three headshots to kill someone! WTF?? Then it takes one hit in the arm with the pistol to kill someone???? Need I say more??

If you take away all the glitches, it is still a fun game worth a rental.

Concept- Make the one and only Halo killer, but fail misribly

Presintation- 8.5- The Menues are nice and are simplistic. Box art is good too.

Graphics- 7.6- The indoor levels get a 9.0 cause it looks good, but the outdoor parts of the game is unbearable.

Sound-9.0- Easily the high point of the title, the ambient sounds are great, the voicovers a little corny, but otherwise great.

Playability- 8.0- It is easy to controll, but the hiit detection fricken sucks!

Entertainment- 7.7- It overall an above average game.

Replay Value- 8.0- It has good multiplayer modes, but once again, the hit detection sucks. Not the Halo killer the ps2 owners wanted"
3.0	"The Story is about Indiana Jones and the original adventures he had and everyone liked, unlike his 4th movie. This game covers all the good movies that Indiana has been from Raiders of the Lost Ark to Temple of Doom, and the Last Crusade, all in Lego form. So if you lived under a cave, rock, or just too lazy, like me, and haven't seen these legendary movies then you will be a bit lost as the scenes have no real dialogue, minus a few grunt, and are sometimes altered to include more family friendly themes, as well as humor, which may make you smirk from time to time. Really though you would have to see the movies in order to get most of the scenes, or just watch a lot of TV. So there isn't much to the story in this game, so those that haven't watch it will be at a loss. The Visuals, are all in its Lego Glory. The Sound of Indiana Jones and the movie soundtrack, much like the story is pretty much copy and pasta on this game. However I find it to sound a lot more like the star wars movies then the Indiana Jones movies. (probably because I actually watched those)The Game is the standard get from point A to point B. You go through each level solving puzzles WITH LEGOS and you build things WITH LEGOS, and everything in the world is LEGOS! Course just by giving a quick glance I'm sure most of you already know this by now. LEGOS!

A Lego's charm can only last for so long however, and while LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures may be fun at the beginning, the charm and excitement of being a LEGO can only be fun for so long, and in time starts to become too repetitive. It's not a horrible game, but you won't be coming back to replay it so often. And if you didn't get it in the 360 bundle, or used, it most likely isn't worth your money. I personally like to rename it LEGO Indiana Jones: the Average Adventures.(subtitle: with lots of boring puzzles and breaking stuff). But maybe those that like Indiana Jones may find it more than I did. Didn't you just get this in the bundle anyway?"
3.0	"Overall, I really liked the original game.  Its like a very good improvement on Rebellion.  Same sort of concepts with managing a large empire over several planets, but its just more intuitive and easier than Rebellion (especially the space combat).  The campaigns are good and fun.  The space skirmishes are fun, but the ground ones just aren't my thing.  I don't know if I'm just not getting it or what, but they last forever as I slowing grind into their base to destroy the enemies buildings.

The galactic conquest skirmishes are interesting, but can be a little overwhelming.  Essentially, you select the map you want to play on and then control on the planets, build fleets, etc. the same way you would in the campaign.  Its okay, but like I said, it can be overwhelming when you start with a dozen planets spread across the galaxy and have to build up their infrastructure and defend them.

In regards to the expansion, I thought the pirates or whatever, where way overpowered.  They might have changed this with a patch or something since I last played it, but seriously they were way to powerful in space.  The campaign for the expansion is strictly focused on the pirates, you don't have the option to play as the Rebellion or the Empire.

Truth be told, some of the mods you can download make this game really fun! The original is good the expansion is something to be desired"
3.0	Temporary review. I received the item. It feels heavier than the new battery and boasts the same model number as the one in the picture. The sticker on my battery indicates this is a 1000mAh battery though, the same as the original. I never got to run it through a full charge because my PS4 bricked on me. Will be receiving a new PS4 tomorrow, but will not be taking my controller apart until I hear back from the seller on this discrepancy. Will update review at that time. Sketchy.
3.0	"I just could not get this game to run on my computer.

I tried all the tech support and patches. it was very disappointing. However, I ended up borrowing a copy from a friend and it is a pretty awesome game! I have almost completed it and ready to start over and play it again.

Bottom line: I have always trusted Amazon and always receive outstanding service! It wasn't Amazon's fault the install CD was defective. I have had trouble with other UBI games. Would not PLAY!"
3.0	"The Good: Superb visuals and audio, links with Metroid Fusion, lots of exploring, fun boss fights

The Bad: Doesn't evolve the formula, constant backtracking is tedious, lousy save system, funky controls, no multiplayer, getting 100% is nigh impossible without a FAQ

I could never really get into the Metroid series due to its lack of a decent story. While Samus Aran is a gaming pinnacle there's not much behind her besides she's an orphan raised by the Chozo race of Tallon IV. A ""Great Poison"" came to the planet from a meteor impact and ever since the Chozo had to flee their home world. Samus, being armed with Chozo armor and weapons, attempts to save the world from the Space Pirates and jellyfish...I mean Metroid. The game consists of five huge levels that you go back and forth from finding upgrades to your suit. There are a total of 4 weapons, 4 weapons upgrades, plus a few Morph Ball upgrades etc.

My favorite part of the game are the cool Morph Ball sections yet there aren't enough of them. You can, eventually, use the Spider Track Ball upgrade to click to ceilings and walls and there are some really cool segments for this yet only a few. You explore each level by needing to use a certain upgrade to get through such as a door needing a certain weapon to open it. You can also get missile expansion upgrades, power bomb upgrades, and energy tank (life) upgrades, but most of these are extremely hard to find and only die-hard Metroid fans will spend the time finding them. On the other hand there are tons of different enemy types and cool bosses. The game is just about exploring and now that it's in 3D Nintendo really makes you explore. The controls are ""dumbified"" for Nintendorks who were used to the 2D era and didn't know how to control an FPS so there is a lock on system (that is a bit annoying) and you use the L trigger to move your reticle. This can be really annoying for people used to standard FPS controls. You have to always stop to find out where to jump while enemies are attacking you. First hint: Nintendo this doesn't work! Secondly, there are a lot of different types of environments from water, to ice, to viney green lands.

Once you find your Gravita suit you can run through water with no problem so in turn you can explore more areas. After you get all of your add ons you have to find twelve artifacts to get to Metroid Prime. Basically, if you've played other Metroid games this is exactly like those except in 3D. I hated the constant backtracking and lousy save system. You will be in one level but the next add-on is two levels away. Instead of warping there you have to run through every single level and the enemy respawning doesn't help either. The best thing I liked about this game was the visuals. They look amazing for a launch title, and what's amazing are all the effects. Water and steam will hinder your vision, there will be static on-screen when your electronics are disrupted, Samus' face will reflect off her visor.

The sound, on the other hand, isn't so great with Ecco the Dolphin esque music and creepy techno. While some of it works it just sounds really old. There is also no multiplayer at all so this is another disappointment. You can link your Metroid Fusion GBA game for extra stuff, but I couldn't try that out. The game also sports the lamest endings ever (and I got the second best one). Overall, if you hated Metroid before you still will, and if you loved it before you'll love it more. Newcomers stay away if you don't like your FPS formula messed with. I don't hate Metroid I just wish it would evolve more. Constant backtracking and lack of story make for an irritating experience"
3.0	played well Three Stars
3.0	Ok game I like it Three Stars
3.0	I haven't played an NFS game in a while and needed a fix. This game was satisfying, but could of been better. For your need for speed.
3.0	I've played these games a few times on my laptop. Upwords can be challenging, Hangman was no problem for me most of time. Word Hunter was a nice surprise as well. As others have said, the big disappointmemt here is Boggle. Clicking on and carrying letters is time consuming, and you're racing against the clock. I prefer the version of Boggle where you can type in your words. Other than that, this is a fun collection of word games that could help to teach younger people some new words. Upwords and Hangman are OK
4.0	Bought this for my daughter, 3 years old to get the controls down before playing other games. Not the best game but will teach her how to use the remote and the wii. She likes the shooting game with balloons. Good for what it is
4.0	This IS the funnest game I have ever played. If your looking for a game with good graphics, this isn't for you, though. But if your down with old school hardcore action then you need to buy this! Old School Fun
4.0	"Nintendo has never had a shortage of impressive first party franchises that spawned some of the best experiences in gaming. Super Mario, Super Metroid, Zelda, these are the figurative gold mines that Nintendo has, and Kirby lays in the lower part of that list. The lovable pink hero has been prominent, however, with it seeing 23 total games. Triple Deluxe would be exactly what Nintendo needs to push the Kirby franchise to possibly the same ranks as its biggest revenue makers.

First off, it just has great platforming values, mechanics and ideas. The hit detection engine is as accurate as ever, as is the pacing and the way all the new abilities introduced just works seamlessly together to produce a smooth flow from start to final boss. Kirby jumps onto an 'ability bubble' and he gains that particular power, and thus use it to dispatch enemies, maneuver obstacles, to circumvent special locks or doors or in some cases, secret areas to acquire special sunstones and attractive virtual keychains, the game's two collectables. Some bosses require those powers to be approached, and if Kirby sucks them in after they have fallen, or simply sucks in the run-of-the-mill mobs before they have a chance to answer with an attack, he gains the same powers they have. It's all a fun game to be had.

The second thing would be how the gameplay just flows into more gameplay, given that getting all of the sunstones opens up new special areas, that in turn yields more keychains. More of that fun game can be had.

Last of all, the game has as close to a perfect engine as a Nintendo game can have, and the best Kirby graphics yet. If that means perfection for Triple Deluxe it simply is. Triple Deluxe has the most fun gameplay all packed into a game that is flawless, technically and artistically. One could argue that it stands as one of the greatest Nintendo games of the year, and Kirby should be moving up in people's playlists and hearts with ease if the quality keeps coming in. ... impressive first party franchises that spawned some of the best experiences in gaming"
4.0	"Folks, this is *THE* GTA my generation grew up with not the cheesy 3D versions that exist today. While I do not dismiss the greatness that comes with 3D, the 2D bird's eye view was a great experience at the time and even today. The game was pure fun with little decadence compared to the modern installments.
The PC version is much better though but do not get it from Steam if you own an old PC equipped with a 3Dfx accelerator because the Steam version does not come with 3Dfx support! GTA in its greatest glory"
4.0	Fun game, easy to learn, interesting story.  The ending of the main game and the DLC (which comes on disk, not as a redeemable code) are depressing as hell. Had fun playing...until the end
4.0	"I didn't care much for Origins and I liked DA2 a lot. I've been playing Inquisition nonstop.

Yeah, in the beginning I didn't like the PC UI or the keyboard controls. I could have switched to the controller if I wanted to, but I decided to stick with keyboard just because. I've been playing for over a week now and to be honest, it gets easier to handle the more you play. You get used to the controls and the game moves along just fine. Yeah, they took a different approach with the mechanics of the game. It plays more like Skyrim, with better characters and more realistic limitations on whether or not your mount can scale a mountain (spoiler: it can't).

I'm finding I'm less reliant on tactics in battles. I don't mind that. If I needed to rely on tactics, I would, but I seem to get through battles without needing to be super thoughtful about who is doing what move from what position every second of the fight. In that regard, I'm reminded of Mass Effect-- you can plow forward and, for the most part, your party will handle itself if you let it, and you can stop and reorganize people if things do get out of hand. However, I will say that the reason I decide not to rely on tactics, is because the tactical camera and controls are a pain in the ass (again, on KB&M here) and I don't feel like wasting my time-- I just want to play.

The rest of the game is great. The graphics are smooth, the environments are beautiful, the characters are fantastically written and voiced, and there's an absolute minimum map repetition, which happened a lot in the first two games and got old fast. So far every place I've been to has been unique to itself with the exception of a couple small caves, which were too dark for me to really distinguish whether they were the same or not. This game is enormous and there's plenty to do to keep you occupied. I think what a lot of people are complaining about is less about flawed game design and more about game design they just don't like because it's not what they expected. Bioware decided to do it differently this time. That doesn't mean it's automatically bad, it just means you have to learn how to play.

In summary: it's the Dragon Age universe with open-world gameplay. There are some controls issues, but it doesn't keep me from enjoying this game. I love it and I recommend it to people who love the Dragon Age universe and characters but like Skyrim better than Origins. People who have not played the previous two games will probably be pretty lost and have no idea what any of the characters are talking about, so new players to the franchise will have a hard time investing in the story, which in my opinion is what carries the series. I've been playing this almost nonstop (ON KB&M)."
4.0	"I must say that I am mostly impressed.  This game is the first Batman video game I've ever played that I enjoyed (the others, quite frankly, were awful).  The graphics are great, the movement is very fluid, and the animated sequences are fantastic.  They developed no shortage of moves for Batman, such as gliding with his cape, or hiding in shadows against the wall.
The problem is that the game can be very frustrating at certain points due to the limitations in control.  It would have worked much better if its controls were more like Halo and Max Payne, in which you move with one thumbstick and control the viewpoint with the other.  Here, Batman's perspective is limited and you constantly have to press the trigger button when you want to look in the direction that Batman is facing.
The fight scenes are good, as are Batman's martial arts moves, but there are certain parts where it is very awkward and frustrating to maneuver him.  The biggest example of this is when fighting Poison Ivy's minions hand-to-hand; the very slight delay between pressing the button and the execution of the move is just long enough for the plant guy's to knock you on your butt.
Having Batman use the grapple is neat, but very limited: you use the grapple only to certain select spots where they allow you to do it, and not to any surface that would likely be able to hold a grappling hook.  It's not like Spider-Man (which in most ways was obviously Batman: Vengeance's biggest inspiration) where you can pretty much use the web to attach to whatever you want.
The car and plane chases are lame.  There's no other word for them.  The detail is scant, control is very limited and if you deviate even slightly from the set path, you lose and have to restart from the checkpoint.  Basically, it's as if the developers spent five minutes working on the vehicle sequences.
If you compare this game to trend setters such as Playstation's Spider-Man, which set the standard for urban superhero games, or X-Box's Halo, which has amazing graphics, fantastic control and great vehicles, Batman falls a little short.  Still, for anyone who loved the animated series (which I did), it is a heck of a lot of fun to interact in Gotham City, the atmosphere of which the developers flawlessly mirrored for this game.  I was very impressed by the graphics and it was so great that they got the original cast from the cartoon to provide the voices here. Lives up to expectations... almost"
4.0	GOOD Four Stars
4.0	It didn't come with the case but at least I got it. Great game Great game
4.0	Interactions feel so much more realistic.  The religion component is cool too.  Still, not quite enough depth to fully satisfy me. Better AI
4.0	"The whole Halo bandwagon, fanboy fag crap and all this other Halo crap is really getting boring. Now they got books and Halo 2 is getting more hype then San Andreas ever did. So why do people like this game so much? Because you shoot aliens.

This game is so basic, I could of invented it. It is the best shooter on X-Box, but it is nowhere near what GoldenEye was on the N64. Sure, everybody loves Halo because it was the best game on X-Box and some kids still think it is. GoldenEye started shooters, and no game will ever be better. I am not just saying this because you shoot aliens, but a simple alien storyline gets pretty boring after a while. Halo was fun, but now it is out of control. I am not like that other guy, but I would rather shoot real people then shoot aliens. The plotline in GoldenEye was so much better, and the guns were better.

The storyline is that you are a magical thing that is a captain of a spaceship and you are sent down to kill aliens. Now, the game is impossible and your health meter refills automatically. This is good but it was invented because they made it hard. The guns are sub-par, and not as good as GoldenEye, which had real guns instead of little play guns that shoot green crap out of them. The game has it's up's because you can drive and has a great multi-player, but it is not as good as driving a tank in GoldenEye, running over somebody. GoldenEye has a better storyline and better levels, sad that GoldenEye came out in the late 90's and Halo came out for X-Box.

But, it is fun, thats why it has 5 stars. But the game is not as good as GoldenEye because GoldenEye had better guns, a realistic plot, bad N64 graphixs and it started the shooter genre. So Halo fans, hate me and give me 100 negative votes, but you all know which game is better, and it's not this. Hate Me, But Not The Best Shooter Ever..."
4.0	I have a lot of good memories of the early days of Spyro. He is still a lot of fun to be and also has a partner to help him out. My only complaint is the camera angles/views. It can be difficult to see what you're doing at points in the game. Spyro fans should enjoy playing this. A good game
4.0	"When a car crash kills her parents, teenage girl Fiona (a somewhat elf-like gal in some of her expressions and mannerisms) wakes up in the dungeon of an immense castle.  Befriending a large white dog named Hewie by rescuing him from a snare-trap, girl and dog set out to explore the castle and grounds, initially intent on simply finding their way out, but soon getting drawn into a labyrinth of secrets and conspiracies.

  The most immediate thing about ""Haunting Ground"" giving it its own identity is the two-member team you have in Fiona and Hewie.  The player controls Fiona directly and through Fiona can direct Hewie with a variety of commands to carry out such actions as searching out hidden items or attacking enemies.  Hewie will also take actions on his own, and how responsive the furry l'il guy is depends on how good a rapport Fiona can establish with him.  I really enjoy the horror games with something of a team scenario, from titles like ""Resident Evil: Outbreak"" with its party actively looking together, to entries in the ""Silent Hill"" saga where you generally control one character but often have a partner with you who acts on their own toward the same purpose; so the unique set-up of one human/one canine is really neat.  As you navigate the grounds and the interior of the castle - some of which is majestic and elegant, other parts mysterious and creepy, you encounter a host of other characters.  Some of these are clearly enemies; in other cases a large part of the game's mystique is trying to figure out which characters are on your side and which are against you.

  As for the gameplay, there are definate plus-es and minus-es.  In figuring out a lot of the conundrums you're faced with, a lot of the time you really have to put your head into logically figuring things out instead of just wandering around waiting to stumble upon something.  Other times - less frequent - it's all trial-and-error through getting killed and pressing continue, as there are a couple of crises you have to escape where it seems impossible to make it through in time without knowing in advance exactly which path to take and exactly where and when each obstacle is going to come crashing down.  Thankfully these scenarios are few and far between compared to the parts where you're relying on strategy and skill, and, perhaps most importantly, teamwork between Fiona and Hewie.  One minus is the fighting system.  Fiona has few attacks of her own, which isn't inherently a bad thing, but the way it works sometimes is.  In kicking, for example, there are times when you connect with the enemy when it clearly looks like you're missing; other times you're right in position but miss anyway.  The most frustrating part of this is the way you can acidentally sock it to Hewie when he looks to be well out of range and it seems safe to flail all-out at your common enemy.  Other attacks, such as using various concoctions you can throw at your enemies or plant in landmine fashion, tend to be free of these glitches.

  Another plus is the whole alchemy-based nature of the game, with element transmutation, golems, mandrakes, and all kinds of cool concepts cropping up.  A major shortcoming was that in making your way through the game you end up allying with different characters, and some of the time there seems to be literally no way to progress without assisting these characters in some ethically questionable (to say the least) pursuits of their own.  I'm looking forward to going through it again and seeing if I have better luck finding a way around certain tasks.

  The graphics are very well-done, and utilize an unusual color look - generally a tad on the pale side - to give it a unique feel.  Sound is great and so is the design of the characters.  Fiona goes into 'panic mode' (similar to Alicia in ""Clock Tower 3""; in fact there are several elements in here reminiscent of that outstanding title) and you have to use certain items to restore her stability.  Also, realistically, both Fiona and Hewie get tired if they run around endlessly, and need to rest or recover through other items.

  ""Haunting Ground"" isn't perfect, but overall it's another highly successful entry in PS2's roster of horror games, highly recommended for fans of games like ""Clock Tower"" and ""Silent Hill"". Another Great PS2 Horror Game With A Lot Of Cool Original Elements"
4.0	"I love all arkham games and while I feel the gameplay on the previous two are better executed than on this game. This game is not far behind, the gameplay is solid and boss battles feel unique and fun.
story wise i had more fun on this one than on the previous games maybe it was just me. Personally I felt that Batman fighting for his pure existence, mean while meeting iconic villains for the first time was more interesting. Best story."
4.0	"First let me try to clear something up.... there is only one version of this game for the Xbox 360. The fact that it says ""Uncaged Edition"" doesnt really mean anything. There is no ""Regular Edition"" of the Xbox 360 I have seen this question posted many times on various message boards.

So im going to assume that if your reading this you already know a little about Wolverine and the fact that he has very sharp claws on both his hands. So logically he uses these claws to cut things and people with. This game is very bloody and very violent. this is not really a kids game. Heads and arms go flying off on a regular basis.

Game play.

This is where the game really excels. Wolverine has full use of his claws and his legendary healing powers right from the start. The game features an ""Experience"" system that enables you to level Wolverine up in a few key areas. a few of these areas include how effective his claw attacks are and how fast his healing factor kicks in to repair his injuries.

Of course Wolverine's main method of attack is his deadly claws(whether they be Bone or Adamantium). You have the option of using either a light attack or a heavy attack. Mixing up the buttons will allow you to unleash some pretty brutal combos that normally end up cutting off some poor guys head or arm. You also have a grab button that allows you to either quick kill and enemy of toss him across the room. There are plenty of more moves that you can use to rip your enemies apart i just listed a few here.

Graphics.

The graphics are pretty good but can sometimes stutter a little and the framerate will drop if there is a lot going on. The Wolverine model is great! the more damage you take, the more it shows. And trust me you will be taking some heavy damage in this game and you will see Wolverines ribs. Its pretty cool to watch his skin grow back and heal his wounds.

Cons.

Not really much to say here but there are a few things. First is that the load times can be kind of long. Sometimes as long as 30 Sec. between levels. The game can be glitchy and you might see some odd things like Wolverine getting stuck in midair during cut scenes and stuff. But i have yet to encounter any game-breaking glitches. The story is really where the game drops the ball. The game constantly jumps between Wolverines past mission and his future missions. It doesnt really flow right....but its not really that much of a big deal but its worth mentioning.

The game can get a little repetitive. You will find that you can get through the game pretty easily by just using one or two moves so have fun and mix it up.

Overall

I really enjoyed this game a lot. If your a Wolverine fan then you really need to pick this game up or is you simply enjoy a good hack and slash. There is something really satisfying about leaping onto a guy from across the street and impaling him with your claws only to pick him up and slam him onto a spike on the floor. Finally an accurate Wolverine game"
4.0	I Love the Beatles ! My Brother and I even though we both grew up in the 80s have listened to enough Beatles music just as any other Beatles lover. I got this as a Christmas present and although I still haven't had the money to get me a Guitar or Drum set I do got a Wii Mic and enjoy doing Karaoke to the Favorite Beatles songs. I'm just a bit disappointed that you have to pay $0.99 cents for extra Beatles songs from the Wii Store such as HELP, Eleanor Rigby, Strawberry Fields, etc. But if you're a diehard Beatles fan you'll pay the extra to buy all the extra songs available. I can't wait to get a drum set to truly enjoy this game but I still think its a great game either way. I hope they create other Band specific versions. I'd Love to get one of the Queen, Rod Stewart, Sting, or genre focused types like 80s songs and such like the PS2 Singstar series. I wanna be Under the Sea in a Octopus's Garden in the Shade.

4.0	"The story is nothing but an excuse to blow things up. Now the gameplay is basically centered around random missions that are pretty much the same. Go to point A & then kill/rescue/blowup. So don't expect story telling or any level deign in this open world action game.

The enemies are repetitive because they respawn over & over. You can run throw them with the hammer & do whatever your objective was.

The game has cool upgrade system where you collect debris & its treated like money. So you can spend it on new weapons or make your existing weapons more powerful.

Graphics are really good.

Its a fun pickup n play type game. Dont expect anything other than a action game"
4.0	"Well, I have to give it four stars because I haven't had it for very long (3 months), and I only have the PS1 to compare it to.  So far, however, it has worked great.  After owning a reliable, fully functional PS1 for the last few years, I expect nothing but the same from this gaming console.

The only problem I've had is that it doesn't seem to want to recognize one of my Dance Dance pads.  Strange.  It's not the pad, because it still works with my PS1.  And the other pad works fine.  *shrug*  I don't know what to say about that.

You can use your PS1 controllers on the PS2, so you don't have to buy extra stuff to play two-player games.  The compact design may help it travel more, but I don't intend to use it for that.

I've been playing Grand Theft Auto:  San Andreas mostly, but I've rented other games, and I've been happy with the way they've all been running.  The graphics are truly amazing.  The processing speed blows my mind.

I don't know, however, if people shouldn't just wait for the PS3 to come out next year (2006). good so far"

4.0	"Most movies based on video games suck. Likewise, most video games based on movies suck. This one is an exception. It has a lot to do with the fact that Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd co-wrote the script for the game. The graphics are good and original characters are all well rendered with good voice acting. Better still, the original actors return to voice all four ghostbusters, even the token black one Winston. The original actress returns to voice the secretary, although she looks younger and hotter in the game. They even got the original actor to voice, Peck, their annoying antagonist. Bill Murray's brother voices the mayor and he looks like himself. You play a generic fifth rookie ghostbuster, who doesn't get a name or a voice. You are referred to as rookie and cadet most of the game.
The game play, sound effects and graphics are pretty good. You get a small variety of weapons, and have the ability to upgrade them somewhat. You acquire money throughout the game for capturing or destroying ghosts, and can use that money for your upgrades. You should be able to purchase all your upgrades well before the game is over, after which money is useless.
The game features the original theme music though not the whole cord, and not the song (no lyrics).
This game can be enjoyed by kids and adults, and features a fair amount of humor. You will chuckle more then actually laugh. Difficulty on the normal setting is actually pretty challenging. However, the difficulty of certain parts is really sporadic, as most of the boss fights I found easy, where as some supposedly simple parts proved very difficult and took repeated tries. The hardest part of the game is near the end by a gate, and is ridiculously difficult.
Fortunately the game saves your progress automatically at check points and there are many. Unfortunately you can't have saved games to just replay your favorite parts, and the although the checkpoints are usually well placed, some of them require you to go back through boring stuff you already did.
The game is very linear and there are no choices to be made. At several points in the game you have the ability to wander around the station before going on your next mission. It's interesting the first time, but there is nothing to do there, and it's absolutely pointless. I get the feeling they wanted to add something else to do there, and ran out of time or money.
Some jokes, ghosts and places are rehashed from the movies. All things considered this was pretty good for a games based on a movie, and most fans of the movies will probably enjoy this Not everyone's cut out to be a ghostbuster"
4.0	High quality but expensive Four Stars
4.0	"Okay, so I really liked this game. My sister got it for me for my birthday present, but installed it on her computer and steam account before mine. I installed it on my computer, and it requested that my sister grants me permission to play it. She added me to her family list and I was able to play it for a few days. But then, it started asking me once again to request for permission before I can play it, and her computer is in the shop, so I don't think that she took me off her family list. It started working again today, so it might have just been an internet connection flaw, or something, but I don't want this to be a continuous thing or something, because I really like it. Sort of like ""Empires: Dawn of the Modern World"", but yet better so far.
 Just as a reminder, if you're giving a steam game as a gift to anybody, let them install it first, no offence to my sister, because she didn't know.
 P.S. I don't really own the Game of the year  version, but I believe that the review is just as effective. It's working again for now."

4.0	"This is an outstanding controller. Very comfortable to hold and all buttons are in easy reach. It is already perfectly set up for use with the Street Fight IV & the default button configuration. Moves requiring quarter, half & full circle movements are incredibly easy do, thanks to the floating digital pad. And they can be done consistently. It comes a with handy Turbo button which makes characters like Chun-Li & E. Honda especially dangerous.

My only problem with the controller & its floating digital pad is that it may be too sensitive sometimes. For characters that require charge attacks or precise up and down movements of the digital pad for combos, the Dualshock 3/Six-axis controller is actually easier to use & more consistent.

If you have PS3 then you already have the standard controller & I highly suggest you try out the Fight Pads to get the most out of this game. It will probably come in handy for other fighting games as well. I fully intend to use this pad on Tekken. Good for most, but not all characters..."
4.0	It works as expected Four Stars
4.0	"After the practically failed and laughable first game, I decided not to purchase the second game when it came out. I had seen where critics called the game ""better than the first"" but also how they said that the game wasn't any more fun. I went out on a limb when I bought this, after seeing the third movie and finding out that the Dark of the Moon game isn't available for PC. I am glad to say that this game is MUCH better than the previous.
The characters are spot on, and the weapons are actually useful this time around. With more weapon modes and attacks, quicker, seamless transformations, and smoother controls, this game far outweighs the first. The animations are perfect, and the minions for either side are more like out of the movie, instead of cartoony like this games predecessor. There are even multiple gameplay modes.
The (decepti)cons to this game though, are that the gameplay modes repeat for both campaigns, and after you complete the (easy) side objectives in each level, there isn't much more call for playing it. While it is very fun, the replay level is low. Die hard fans should get a few play-throughs out of it. Passing fans may want to just rent it for a console somewhere.
Good game, but doesn't offer anything you haven't seen before somewhere. Love Transformers? At least give this game a try. Revenge of the Game"

The only thing I love is that it can work as a mouse. I live in a dorm and I play game out side. So now I don't have to take an extra mouse with me every time I went out for gaming. However, there are a lot of things I don't like. The left and right bumper make big noise and there is almost no physical feedback when I press them. These two bumper is just like the new version of the apple trackpad. Also the arrow pad and the trackpad (work as right stick in game) also make huge noise when I press them down. Furthermore, I personally hate that they switch the position of ABXY and the right stick. I play games like Street Fighter, Injustices, and Brawlhalla. These games require  a lot of press on ABXY. now I have to stretch my thumb to the middle of the controller and that's painful if I do that for a long time. However, It does looks better when play GTA and Assassin Creed, but you have to sped twenty minutes adjusting the setting before your first time using that in the game. Generally, I like it. but it is not perfect for gaming. The only thing I love is that it can work as a mouse"
4.0	Works as advertised. Four Stars
4.0	Does not replace the nunchuck on many Wii games. Works well but with very few games

4.0	"I have spent a whole lot of quality time with ONI over the weekend, and I have come to the conclusion.....I love this game!!
ONI's gameplay reminds me of a cross between Fighting Force and Metal Gear Solid  (Two games which I love).  The graphics are great, and the levels are huge. Oni has quite a few moves which are fun to use while fighting.  The weapon selection is very cool too, (especially with the force feedback on.) The challenges at the end the first two levels were nicely done. (I can't wait to see what else is in store for me on the later levels.)
The only drawbacks to ONI is the sound, which seems to get disjointed at times when the characters are talking.  This can be somewhat annoying at times, but fortunately, it doesn't happen enough for it create too much of a problem.
Overall, Oni is challenging enough to keep you playing, and will keep you wanting to get to the next level.  With 17 huge levels, Oni will keep you busy for quite a while.  This game wins, with great graphics and fun gameplay.
Finally, another game worth owning on the PS2 has been released!!!
Recommended!! This is a fun game!!"
4.0	"This game is fun for all ages and has excellent graphics! It has some funny characters (mainly Daxter) and is a ""Greatest Hits"" game. The game is about how Daxter transforms into a muskrat by falling into a pool filled with ""Dark Eco."" He decides to set off on a journey with Jak, in search of a cure for his transformation. The game is an action/adventure/platform type. You (Jak) must complete different tasks to receive Power Cells that help aid your quest. The moves that Jak can perform are pretty neat. There are the basic jumps, punches, kick spins...stuff like that, and then there are the uppercuts, rolling turbo jump, dive attack, and the aerial attack. I thought that the only bad thing about the game was that it was too short. I finished the game in about 1-2 weeks, couple hours a day. I just hope that the sequel will be much longer. Overall, I recommend this game to anyone that likes to play adventure/platform games.  =) Great game, but short..."
4.0	Really good headphone, I can hear everyone perfectly. The only bad side is the battery life. Overall Good Item
4.0	"I'm gonna say it right now - I hopped right onboard this TMNT game on account of Platinum Games having developed it. However, despite that, this new Ninja Turtles game does carry the Activision logo, and speaking from experience with their non-Call of Duty games, this could either be a pleasant surprise (aka Platinum's name reigning supreme) or an absolute crapfest (aka Activision meddling Platinum out of a good game as they usually do with devs). Thankfully, this game is actually the former.

So Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan is Activision's fourth game for the franchise, but the first one to be notable for actually trying to make an effort. While the main menus give off a low-budget feel, that matter becomes rectified by the well-presented cutscenes, which demonstrate the game's comic book styled graphics and adequate voice acting and animation. The plot is simple enough; Shredder and Krang team up to try and use outer space to invade the city and wipe it out, and of course it's up to the heroes in a half-shell, with April's guidance, to stop them. That aspect tends to go by the numbers, but it does get presented well enough, and it has its chuckleworthy moments (Well...as well as a couple cringey ones).

As can be expected from a game by Platinum, action-packed beat 'em up gameplay is key to Mutants in Manhattan's formula. The levels kinda sorta give off an open-world vibe, as places like Manhattan itself can be explored freely. However, the game really wants the player to focus on the missions. The entire adventure is mission-based, which range from killing an amount of enemies to preventing a tangible weapon from being used by them. The missions are kept at a solid pace for the most part, but there are some that I just wish were nullified or not in the game altogether; case in point is that of which the player has to disarm bombs. Don't worry, it's not like that water level in the NES TMNT game. But this game instead has you hold down the B button to disarm a bomb (Granted, enemies may try and fight the player to pose a challenge for this, but.....C'mon), which is a pace-breaker in comparison to anything else. Only a couple of the game's nine lengthy levels feature these missions, but again, I feel like they could've easily been something better.

On a slightly different note, the T Glass feature (which helps you see where your mission objective is located) seems nice and all, but I feel like it'd be cool if there was also a standard map radar in case I don't want to have to keep switching between regular graphics and the super-technical view.

When the action goes down, however, it goes DOWN. Sure, the game is oddly in 30 frames per second instead of the usual 60 that Platinum Games embrace(s), but boy does it feel like a mashup of oldschool arcade beat 'em ups and modern-day variety! Considering how many post-Konami TMNT games have been monotonous with the enemy variety, I was surprised to see that this game actually does HAVE a variety of baddies to kill, complete with their own ways of attacking. And the Turtles have a few options themselves - Each Turtle has different special moves he can pull off by holding the L Trigger and pressing a face button (and you can switch between Turtles via L Trigger and D-Pad) as well as attack combos executed by pressing X and/or Y buttons. While there are enemies that go down fairly quickly and reasonably through a combo or two, don't be shocked when the game decides to turn you into turtle soup.

This is actually a challenging game. It's not brutal by any means, but it does a decent job of keeping the player on his/her toes. The boss battles are probably what impressed me the most. They feel like bosses from an arcade game by Konami, brought into 3D. Their patterns are tricky and varied, but when you beat the crap out of them you feel like you're the MAN (or woman, depending)! Too bad you can't celebrate the victory with anyone unless you play online.

Alright, time to address some more negatives...
Easily the biggest problem with this game is the inability to play with friends on the same couch. No local multiplayer, online only, Final Desti-Wait, wrong game. But yeah, even though I don't mind playing single-player, I still find it dumbfounding that they took the time to create online servers for this game, yet for some reason the only way you're playing this locally is by yourself. Which is absolutely BS because this seems like it would've been an awesome time to spend with local friends! All four Turtles are in this adventure fighting TOGETHER after all. It all just seems like a big missed opportunity on Platinum's/Activision's part.

There's also all this talk about MiM's length, which is reported to be able to be beaten in three and a half hours or under. Personally, my first and only playthrough so far lasted 5 hours and 18 minutes, which is fair enough I suppose, right? I dunno, I'm not really the kind of guy that minds when a game is short. After all, I paid well over fifty bucks for a TMNT Turtles in Time cartridge, and that game can be played through in under an hour.

One thing that comes to mind for me is the sound design. Now, I am fond of the voice acting performances for this game, but when the Turtles end up dying, they can become the most annoying things at the moment. There is banter between them in various areas, but their deaths are when it's most blatant that there are voice clips that have a tendency to repeat, and it can be especially grating during boss battles when trying hard to survive and keep battling. At least there's an option to lower/mute the voice volume, but the attack sound effects seem like they need the voices present to complement the atmosphere. On another note, the music, while actually kind of sporting a catchy beat on certain levels, is certainly no TMNT arcade soundtrack.

Basically, what TMNT: Mutants in Manhattan is is a game not without flaws, but when you're in for the core adventure, it can actually be a lot of fun. I had a very good time playing through this game from start to finish, and if you're looking for a solid Turtles game (but aren't seeing multiplayer as a necessity) I say give this one a go. Those interested but not willing to spend $50 on a game like this can wait for the inevitable price drop that pretty much every Activision game goes through over the course of the initial or second year after release. For now, though, I'm glad to see I can finally count the amount of good games Activision released this decade with TWO hands instead of one from now on! There is some Turtle Power to be had yet!"
4.0	for the money could be better. fits comfortable in hand. main issues are it doesnt hold its grip on the system perfectly and the spot that you plug the charger into makes it difficult for it to not fall out for the money could be better. fits comfortable in hand
4.0	"This is nothing but a cutesy charging stand.  It is very easy to configure, it's already setup for the DSI, if you want to use an XL you pull off a plastic retainer and put a different (supplied) one in.  My daughter loves it and shows it off to everyone.

Pluses - unlike charging stands I've bought (and later thrown out) this thing does NOT have an annoying light up the room glow.

Minuses - either none, or lack of anything but decoration.

This is a huge bragging rights item for an 8 year old and it fits my daughters Pokmon room decor.  Buy it to make your kid happy, or for collectors purposes, but otherwise I'm a big sucker and my daughter has me wrapped around her finger. My daughter loves it.  I'm a sucker for buying it."
4.0	"Great rpg, very vast and many things to explore.

Too bad it's only focused on single player.

If you're looking for a great single-player rpg experience, this title is for you.

If you want to also play multiplayer, you're probably better off avoiding this one. Another great rpg"
4.0	This game stays true to the movie with all your favorite characters. My five year old loves to play this because he loves the movie. It also gives him enough strategy to keep him thinking and not just wasting time. Great game
4.0	"Of all the Turtle Beach sets I've ever owned, this one was by far the most comfortable.

Once I unpacked the box, I was immediately greeted with a leaflet informing me that a controller update was required to make this headset work.  So update I did.  To be clear, this is technically a wired set that works through the controller.  The adapter conveniently works its magic through the controller itself with a set of chat controls.  Works great.

What intrigued me most was its mobile compatibility.  Alas, you will not enjoy any chat functionality there and what it ultimately winds up being is a glorified headphone with a 3.5 mm jack that is connected to the interchangeable cables through a rather clunky adapter interface.  Thankfully, the microphone is fully detachable so at least the headphones can actually WORK like headphones.

Sound-wise, this set is better than previous iterations.  Bass packs a lot less oomph still, but it IS improved.

Sadly, however, one has to wonder why a wired headset is still $149 when a wireless offering is about the same...one might speculate that lack of a wireless function almost increases the overall profit margin on something that should have been priced in the $90 range.  For that reason, I had to dock it a star.

It's a solid set with decent chat functionality, but wow...that price.... Better sound than in the past, but my lord...the price..."
4.0	"Like the title says, this is a solid game, but it does have its flaws.

First of all, let's talk about the good and about what I liked:

Mostly balanced weapons, especially the assault rifle class.

I love the squad point buying system.  The majority of weapons/perks/attachments/etc. can be purchased using squad points that are earned by playing the multiplayer.  I absolutely love this system as it helps to balance out the game.  No longer do you have to wait to unlock the weapon/perk/attachment you want and no longer do you work hard to unlock a weapon/perk/attachment you don't have any use for.  Thankfully, this helps to balance out the game between those who are a higher level and those who are at a lower level.  It was essential that they correct this flaw as it is almost impossible to beat people who are playing with the best weapons/perks/attachments.

You can try it before you buy it.  What I mean by this is that you can play a local game with bots and try out any weapon/perk/attachment and see what you like and don't like and what works and doesn't work for you.  This is essential as it allows you to practice with different combinations and to be sure that you won't waste your squad points on something you don't like.

Good maps.  The maps are good and they compliment the weapons well.  In some cases, you will want something with range and in other cases you will want to use a gun that has a high rate of fire.  That said, you will find that there are about 4 maps that stand out from the rest.

Cool customization.  You have the option to customize you character and his/her look.  Not only that, but there are a plethora of rifle skins and red dot options.

The bad/flaws:

Terrible spawning system.  This, in my estimation, is the biggest flaw in the multiplayer and it has not been addressed.  You will constantly find yourself spawning into deaths.  In one game, I was instantly killed four times in a row while re-spawning.  Furthermore, one can figure out where the players will spawn pretty quickly and they can camp out for easy kills.

I get tired of the knife and constantly being knifed to death.  Some players live by the knife and this may be more a personal dislike than anything.  That said, I wish there was a way or a perk to balance out knife attacks.

Secondary weapons are pretty much useless.  Thankfully, a player can use a perk to add a primary weapon as their secondary weapon.

Graphics are disappointing. Honestly, I don't think there is much difference between X1 and Xbox 360 graphics when it comes to this game.  The game honestly looks like it belongs with the previous generation.

Unfortunately, you have to buy the coolest customization packs.

Final thoughts:

As you can see, I listed a pretty even list of good vs. bad.  That said, don't be discouraged, this is still an awesome multiplayer experience.  Had I paid above $40.00 for this game, I might have leaned more toward 3 stars, however, I picked it up here on Amazon for $14.97 and you cannot beat this game for that price.  That said, the terrible spawning issues and last generations graphics really hold the game back and keep it from being great. Solid Game, But Not Without Flaws"
4.0	need to play for story but this doesnt fel like a real serious sam game though it look more cartoony good game
4.0	I picked this game up at a local store and was a little unsure at first if I was going to like it.  I found it easy to play and also incredibly fun.  The graphics are awesome and the game play is smooth.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes this sort of game or anyone who is interesting in trying these sorts of games for the first time. Very Awesome Game
4.0	does what it says it does. good replica of the controller. only problem is with how much resistance the control stick has. ok
4.0	I have always loved flying games, everything from Microsoft flight simulator to the ace combat series. It's better in ways compared to assault horizon which is the latest installment of the series. It does have a few minor issues. Like the fact that on the Xbox 360 version you have to select your hard drive every time you load a game even if your profile is already logged in. Most Xbox 360 games automatically detect game progress through the hard drive during the loading process. Its kinda annoying but not a big deal. Also there is allot of stuff you need to select when in the menus. But other than those very minor cons the flying is amazing & the aircraft selection is impressive. Better than ace combat assault horizon. You are limited to an altitude of 39,000 feet but I'm pretty sure that some jets in the game can fly higher. The controls are virtually limitless, barrel rolls high G turns etc. Some aircraft tend to stall more than others but that adds some realism to the flying. Great game, would recommend it to anyone into flying games. Great game!
4.0	Great for keeping the WII going without changing batteries all the time.  Love the docking station for the remotes and they light up when charging which helps to know when you set it in correctly.  Only reason I've giving it a 4 star is I had to man handle one battery pack to get it to fit (smash it in). Great Charging Wii Remotes
4.0	If you love the Alien movies, you HAVE to get this game. It's supremely creepy and scary. Even scarier than Dead Space....which I didn't think was possible. Even on Novice mode, which is easier than Easy mode, it's still extremely difficult. But don't get me wrong, it's a LOT of fun to play. If you can, you should spring for the DLC sections. The DLC has the voices and faces of the original movie cast in a nice little short level of a game. Isolation looks exactly like the movies. GREAT atmosphere....especially if you play in the dark with the music turned off. It's a lot scarier without the music, but you should play with the music on a second or third playthrough, just to appreciate it. Scarier Than The Movies...
4.0	Loved the story, the game play, the characters, pretty much everything. Only complaint is that the game is only like 6 and a half hours long. Definitely worth the $10 though Great fun, very short
4.0	"A gift for a 16 year old teen who loves shooter games, and the one game he truly wanted for his new Xbox One.  The game play is straightforward, and, although no game seems to be very hard for him to ""win"", this has been challenging for him.

Luckily, as a Christmas gift, this came while school was not in session, so he can spend hours a day playing the game.  And, he does!  Once he finished his daily chores he is sitting down at the TV and playing.  He's been through the game completely now 2 times and is restarting for the 3rd time. Great game for a dedicated gamer"
4.0	While there are more characters to play then the two towers, they do not feel a whole lot different.  Also, I still feel less like I'm in the movie but in certain scenes from the movie as the cutting is large and continunity is off.  But it is fun, and I like the multiple players options.  Recomended. A fun action game
4.0	I joined the party late, but this has become my go-to online multiplayer on the PS4. Clean combat mechanics, good system of rewards and leveling up, nice variety of maps, and a decent single player campaign. Not too flashy. There is still a large community of players two years after release. In my experience, this is more geared towards every-man-for-himself rather than cooperation. Servers haven't given me any trouble, and it seems that launch problems have been patched. They even released a few more maps recently. Would receive 5 stars if it had offline players v.s. player :/ Get this for the online multiplayer
4.0	It is Ok. It is a good product... It is a good product.
4.0	"I'm using an Acer Aspire laptop, Windows 7.  As usual, no problem downloading or installing.  Updated as offered once it installed.

I ordered this EP for the high hopes of some better hair choices, in particular for the men, and the instruments.  Although in Sims 3 they play with no enthusiasm compared to Sims 2 I still enjoy the 'jams', just from farther back because they just aren't as animated as they used to be.

I was grateful to be able to basically turn Vampire stuff off, I'm not at all interested in the names with Celebrity status stars by my sims name,  but it's a small price to pay for the advantages of the Expansion Pack.

About 6 hours into gameplay, my computer began stalling.  This is the only EP I have installed since base game so I assumed maybe my graphics on this comp weren't capable of keeping up.  I do a lot of switching between households.  It continued to play stilted so after about 2 hours of that I uninstalled this.

After thinking about it for a day, and nosing around EA for trouble-shooting tips,  I realized I had NOT gone off line during my game play.  I reinstalled yesterday, updated, defragged, went OFFline, and started playing.  I have had no problems at all in almost 14 hours of game play.  Which again, included a lot of house switching and town editing.

I can't offer much information on the actual ""Night Life' part of this because I won't use it.  But it had enough clothes, hair, and furnishing upgrades to make it very worth it.  OH, and I love the hot tub.  Although they act like they have fire ants biting their bottoms,  they really enjoy it. :) Satisfied - After Going Offline"
4.0	"When I saw this, it looked like a Resident Evil-type game, only instead of zombies, there's demons and instead of guns, you use swords. I picked this up the other day and now I'm ready to give you, my loyal fans(if I have any), my opinion of Onimusha:Warlords. Now to start off, the graphics are a thing of beauty, even if the game's about 2 or 3 years old. Backgrounds are highly detailed, character models are stunning, and the CG intro is just nothing short of jaw-dropping. Music is pretty darn good too, but the English voice-acting is horrendous. I've set it to the Japanese acting instead of the English. Controls will take some getting used to unless you're a Resident Evil veteran. Once you get the control scheme down pat, it's all gravy from there. Only other complaint is game length, camera issues(like every single Capcom survival horror game) and English acting. I will mention that Onimusha does do a few things better than most games of this particular genre do(save for Devil May Cry). One is you can block attacks, death stab an enemy once it's down, and the swords are fun to use. I know this is a reletively short review, but it's a reletively short game. Overall, I still give it a 4 out of 5. This is Sean David, signing off.

4.0	"In 1990 Nintendo released ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" for the original NES system, and it was hailed as the most commercially successful video game of its time.  In 2003, a remake was translated from the Super NES title ""Mario All-Stars"" to the Game Boy Advance's ""Mario Advance"" series and it still sells at GameStop for $25.  I shelled out half as much for a copy elsewhere and I never looked back.

Aside from the fact that you don't have to beat the game in one sitting with what is otherwise a limited power source, you can win power-ups from minigames before you play through a level.  As with every Mario Advance title, SMA4 includes a remake of the classic Mario Bros. arcade game.  New copies of the game also include special 'level cards' with bonus content for use with Nintendo's short-lived e-Reader device.  While this captures the look and feel of the original SMB3 game, it's not a completely faithful remake; the music's that made me dance along as a kid is slightly toned down.  Otherwise, the updated graphics are pleasing to the eye, the gameplay still excites (and frustrates) the player and the added voiceovers are ""just what I needed.""

This game is rated E for Everyone: Violence. Just What I Needed!"
4.0	It's a good game, even though people say its bad I think it's not too bad. Four Stars
4.0	"The last of us....  hmm Zombies , Post Apocalyptic, Father Daughter or so I thought story. This game was a major reason why I bought a PS4 , I was more inclined to Xbox due to Major titles like Halo, Killer Instinct, Forza and other titles, but this Game caught my attention and wanted to play it.

As far as it stood up to it's rep on a 10 scale I would give it an 8. Good story, the characters are great, nice content and ok re playability. DLC wise very good. What I liked the most in my opinion was the good character design and the movement also the fcat that it was challenging in some points and not predictable.

What I did not like,  it won't be the case with many people, it is that game feels ported and the graphics are not that good being a PS4 remastered title. That would be my only complaint going to more specific details, the porting regarding movement and controls, works well but visually the textures are really bad and some scenery is lacking better visuals. The Lat of Us - Remastered PS4 verison"
4.0	I broke down and finally bought a PS4, just to play this game, and the upcoming Fallout 4. As an old school RPGer, and an off-line player only, there did not seem to be many PS4 titles that were of interest to me. Witcher 3 was thee exception, as I enjoyed Witcher 2 immensely. I was blown away by the detail of this game, as well as the immense world to explore. The side-quests were actually more fun than the main quest, which I found rather disappointing. Each side quest had it's own little story to tell, and the quests were quite varied and well constructed. On the down side, there are still a couple of game breaking glitches that have not been corrected. An infinite loading screen, and a glitch that does not let you use your signs. After looking online, my only way to correct these glitches, was to backtrack to earlier saves. But, for a game this vast and fun to play, I suppose a glitch or two one can put up with. I highly recommend this game. I put in 147 hours on it, and came to the  end at level 36. This is one game where you get your moneys worth! Almost Perfect

4.0	This is a great looking keyboard and the software that comes with it works great, giving you complete control of almost every function. The color control being my favorite. My one issue is that the keyboard takes a bit to get used to if you can type. The keys seem to me to be a little small for my hands and I have small hands. Other then that I love it. Looks great

4.0	Great Product. Four Stars
4.0	"Does anyone remember an SNES game called Alien 3? It was non-canon because it took place on the prison planet in Alien 3 but used the taped-together gun from Aliens and had tons of the critters around when the movie Alien 3 only had a single Xeno. But forget canon, at the time it was a great game that mashed up the gameplay of Contra with a tiny bit of map exploration like Metroid and had quests that sent you here and there and whatnot. That was like what 20 years ago and I still play it on SNES emulators occasionally. This game is pretty much a modernized spiritual sequel of Alien 3.

The character animations are smoother and cooler, sounds are better and spot on, the new firing and walking backwards is nice, I could go on about comparisons but it would probably be wasted since only a few people might have played Alien 3. This is a good 2d shooter. Not great, a few minor issues, but overall good. People say the characters are bland, well yes in general they are. Your fireteam can have 4 marines at a time max, if one dies you roll out the next one. You find replacements across the various maps, but if you have 4 you cannot recruit new ones. Luckily the ones you find around the map typically have ammo and or health pickups so it's not a bad idea to run into them anyway. The main difference you notice playing as different marines is they each have different camo, one is reddish, one brown, one light greenish-grey like the marines on Aliens, one near white, and of course skin color varies pending character too. The dialogue for each character changes but that is a minor thing, interesting to read anyhow.

So the lowdown, this is not a 5-star game but it's a good 4-star game. There is a lot worse games out there. There was only a spot or two that frustrated me, specifically the space-walk sequence. Otherwise it was smooth sailing. Challenging in some spots (especially bosses) for me and I played this exact style game for years and got good at it, expect to lose a lot of marines on your first playthrough. I beat the game after several hours of gameplay but this is a style of game you can play it again every now and then and I'm about to try another playthrough to see if I do better now I know all the neat little tricks like leaning against crates etc. This is a must-have for an Aliens fan with a DS/3DS system or it's a fairly good 2d shooter for anyone else. The bonus knife trick game (knife thing Bishop did in movie) is kinda fun for a minute or two with the touchscreen but nothing too special, I would hate to play it without a screen protector though. Love that noise if you hit your hand. If you like Aliens get it now, good 2d shooter similar to Alien 3"
4.0	"This review will almost completely ignores the limited installations BS. Suffice to say, EA is quickly eroding their customer base. On one hand, they complain about piracy, then wonder why they have more piracy when they impose draconian steps to curtail it.

Red Alert 3 replays the original Red Alert storyline. In place of Einstein, to have the Russian Commandant, played by Tim Curry, who has been involved in more games than Gary Gygax. Using a Russian time machine, they kill Albert Einstein, presumably after he kills Adolf Hitler, setting the stage for a three way war between the Allies, the Soviets, and the Japanese, represented by the Empire of the Rising Sun.

Following the mantra of the previous C&C games, you run through a progressively harder series of missions, sometimes with a combat squad, but often with the familiar base system we all know and love. The storylines are entertaining, though as the title implies, the uniforms have shrunk by five or six sizes. This is strange and disturbing for two reasons. You're so busy staring at breasts that're barely contained by jet black latex suits that you miss your entire briefing, and when you replay the briefing with a strategically placed piece of duct tape, the briefings are really pretty good. Emotions and accents are a tad over the top, but the production values and immersion levels of the Command and Conquer series has steadily improved. Why they felt the need to try and improve sales by making the cutscenes strike of soft-core porn is beyond me.

They've also introduced the deputy commander, a second officer played by either a friend or the computer that maintains its own base and forces. While you can't control the other forces directly, you can give strategic orders to the other commander. This is a great improvement, as you can defend and send them on attack, though more likely vice versa, ensuring there is always a defense force without having to split your focus.

Aside from the neat co-op option that I just mentioned, theres nothing here that hasn't been seen before, but if you're a fan of the series, you definitely won't feel let down. The difficulty curve is a little step later in the game, but not so difficult to make you give up. Cutscenes continue to improve, and in-game mini briefs a more frequent, and make it feel more like a progressing battle than an attrition slugfest. Personally, I'm going to wait for the battle chest with the expansions that's a few months away, but I'm trying to think of my wallet as much as possible. And by that point, hopefully EA will get the sand out of its ears and be able to hear their falling market share, and realize they need a better solution than securom. I love T&A - I mean C&C 3"
4.0	It's a lot harder than super mario U Four Stars
4.0	Mgs is probably my favorite game series out there. I bought this cuz i heard good things and im glad i did. Great story with cool animated and interactive cutscenes. Also really cool to capture anyone you want to recruit. Its an awesome game good to see big boss back in action Mgs is probably my favorite game series out there
4.0	The choice of dogs is quite big, plus all the fun things you can do with them like:  Feed them and taking them for walks, plus all the care and shopping you can do for them.  But that can get boring quickly and the game just gets put out to the way side and never be touched again.  There are many new versions of this game that are far more updated and one can say that more fun as well. Cute but outdated
4.0	"I watched streams for a few days prior to release, looked fun, but wasn't blown away.  However, I'm such a fan of the series I dived in.  I absolutely love it. Streams will undersell you in this case.

 Only negatives for me is the annoying bomb sniffing missions, they just aren't that accurate, and when you do locate one, still stays on the map, plus you gotta pan your camera around to find the marker as you drive around in circles, getting dizzy. Really annoying.

The other negative is the bosses, called Top Dogs, they call look the same with different colored armor and different weaknesses.  Granted the first three I've faced so far all were basically the same guy.

The rest of the game is badazz.  I love my wrenchmate Chum, some people don't like him.  He is your mechanic, sidekick.  I love the idea of progressing thru game getting stronger, more powerful, as does your car.  I also love the fact that Mad Max has a chance to reach road warrior legend status.  Very cool right ?  The game looks great, the map is huge.  The game will give you hours and hours of enjoyment.

 I think I'm conservatively 60% thru but I've played every free moment I've had since launch playing it.

My wish for the future is they make this game go along with the actual series that would make it a 10 to me.  This game has great ratings by users 4.5/5.

By the way you should see all the movies in the series if you haven't they are all a blast.

Buy this game with confidence. Mad Max is a bonafide hit..."
4.0	"The mouse has the perfect sensitivity, hard to adjust at times but everything works. for $3.36 (was on sale), this is a really good product.
Side buttons work fine, they default to Ctrl and Alt for the games I play most of the time (War Thunder, League of Legends, etc).
Only issue I can see some people having is the weight. This mouse literally weighs as much as my keyring with 3 keys and a small card. Not the biggest issue for me when I'm gaming, but the weight did become an issue when it came to trying to do precise clicking in Photoshop and Illustrator.
If you like lightweight mice, then by all means, this is perfect. But if you need something with more weight, and you're a hardcore gamer, you might want to look elsewhere.
I'm sure someone has made a method to add weights to a mouse, I'll have to look into that... Mouse works fine."
4.0	I love this game but the only things that stop from giving it 5 stars in there are no checkpoints and its alittle confusing and hard especially the controls but over all great game when you get use to it. don't think twice. Great game a little confusing.
4.0	A solid mouse with good response, nice controls to adjust speed, and a very comfortable grip. The buttons on the side aren't nearly as useful as I'd imagined, however, and they mostly go unused. A solid mouse with good response, nice controls to adjust speed
4.0	I bought this for my son. He said he likes it. He compared it to The Force Unleashed II and said this one is much better. My son likes it
4.0	Great game played it twice wish they made part two Four Stars
4.0	I'm a fan of Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive but has never been a fan of Dynasty Warriors/Samurai Warriors type games. The last time I played this series of games was on the last generation of consoles... very briefy as I couldn't get into the game's basic and boring combat system. Because of the merger between Koei and Tecmo, my favorite characters are now in a Warriors game. As a true fan, I buy anything that has my favorite franchises in them, including Warrior Orochi 3 and the subpar Ninja Gaiden 3 but that's another story. I was actually a bit upset to have to shell out full retail price for something I never really cared for but after playing couple chapters for few hours with my favorite characters from another world ;) , I find this game has quite a bit of improvements from the last time I played it on the last gen consoles. The combat seems faster and much more fluid. The ability to tag team mates in and out on-the-fly is a big plus and adds greatly to the overall gameplay. The graphics pop in and pop out, although still there, are much better now. The game is still repetitive but there's something that makes me come back every couple days to play few missions in a chapter, and this game has many missions. At the rate I'm going, it will probably take me a whole year to finish the game entirely. That's okay as this game is fun to take small bites at a time. For the first time ever, I can say I enjoy a Warriors game. Ryu Hayabusa and Ayane Made Me Buy This Game
4.0	Combine a bizarre story together with hoarder-like gameplay and you have Beautiful Katamari. All you do is roll a ball around. You start small and collect small items, but then you grow... the game gets crazy. It's really fun and funny and not too frustrating - at least for me. If you can appreciate crazy, try it. Crazy, Fun
4.0	"I love this game.  It's very addictive and looks great, even though it's cartoony.  Only thing I didn't like was the fact that the game of the year edition is not complete.  There is still an ""Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack 2,"" all of the Headhunter Packs, and a bunch of skins that you'll have to buy separately if you want absolutely everything.  Maybe they'll make a ""Complete Edition"" or something? Excellent game, although it's not complete"
4.0	"Batman series is always among the most wanted games we people here have been waiting for. Now we have it! Through the initial play, I want to show you guys my thoughts. I'm not going to review the graphics, or the story line, or the music. Who needs to know that anyway, if you are a big fan in this series. I'm here to tell you what you can do in the game! That is the most exciting part, isn't it?

You can free roam in the city. Btw, the Gotham City is five times bigger than the Arkham City. You are free to choose any mission in this free world.
All the villains are teamed up against Batman! Big challenge. Their only mission is to sabotage Batman, and of course, your mission is to hunt them down. It is sometimes like a puzzle solving game. For example, you come to a crime scene, you listen carefully to the radio, and there is some distinctive music noise at the background, then when you roaming in the city, you happen to hear that music again, BANG, there goes your clue. You found a lead in the crime.

Batman's gadgets. The CAR. It is a super car in any way. For the first time, you can drive it. The car can climb on walls, can switch between pursuit mode and battle mode. It can eject batman to the air, so batman can free roam fly. Oh, did I forget to mention? Batman can fly now.

You can lock up all the villains captured in the free world. You can lock them up in prison, and as you wish, from time to time, go visit them, punch them, teach them a lesson, anytime you want. It is like a villain museum. Of course, those super villains get VIP treatment. It is free for you to explore.

Batman has ALLIES now!!! You can easily switch between them! And they all have their unique movements. I'm not gonna do the spoilers here, but I'm gonna say, they are all unique and super fun to play!

I will continue to add to this thread if I found out anything exciting. The only reason I leave a 4-star is that so we can have room for more exciting things to be found out. Everything is awesome so far. Batman Comprehensive Review"
4.0	Badass. First!
4.0	"This is the first CSI game I've played--for NDS or any other system. I really enjoyed it. Some point and click adventure games get kind of annoying to me because I feel that I'm wandering aimlessly without having a clue where to go that will actually advance the story. That is not an issue with this game. Clues abound--what to do next, where to go, and which locations you are done with.

The downside to having that much in-game guidance is that the game is pretty short. I'm slow at these games, and finished the 5 cases in this one over parts of 3 days. If I'd been concentrating (or didn't have much else to do) I would have finished much sooner.

Another ""con"" is that there doesn't seem to be anyway to replay the puzzles/mini-games without restarting any case you choose and running thru the entire case again. Having finished the 5 cases pretty easily, I just wanted to go back and try to do better at some of the puzzles/mini-games, but found no option to do that. Short of starting the case from the beginning.

I found the dialogue (written, not spoken) to be entertaining and true to the characters of the TV show.

Personally, I really enjoyed the game. Fun!"
4.0	This is great for big groups, the ps3 allows you to make a character and such, but ps2 does not.  Overall good songs, works well. i wish i had a ps3
4.0	I have had these about a week and so far, I really like them. I had a pair of Roccat Kave's that recently had the volume control go wacky. But Roccat was gracious enough to honor the warranty and replace the headset. Kudos to Roccat customer support. But, since I haven't received the Roccat's back yet, I decided to try the Creative Recons based on a good review and the fact they are wireless which would suit me great due to not requiring manipulation of the cord while gaming. So far, it is a joy to have the freedom to move or go for a glass of water without needing to remove the headset and still hear the games background music thumping in your ear two rooms away in the house. They take about five hours initially to charge up the headset. Once charged you get about 3 to 5 hours (depending on how high you spike the volume) of sound before needing a recharge. Sound quality is good but not great. The highs and lows are not what I would consider in the range of professional acoustic quality but are still not bad. You can adjust the volume output of Treble & Bass with the included software. The headest wireless connection can be set to either THX sound like you would have in the movie theater or for you FPS shooter guys (like me : ) you can set it to Scout Mode which allows you to amplify the footsteps of the enemy and give you a slight edge when they are near. It does in fact give you an edge but depending on the game it may not amplify the sound of their footsteps as loud as you would think and sometimes you are hearing your own teams footsteps so keep an eye on the mini-map to confirm. ; ) They are priced a bit steep but you are paying for the technology and if you are able to dish it out, I would recommend these for the wireless freedom alone. I am kind of a Creative Technology fanboy anyway due to having a Creative Fatality Pro sound card in my PC that has been top notch for me. Go get em boys! A solid choice for wireless sound!
4.0	My favorite game on the PSVR as I am a huge Star Trek fan. The only complaint is the limited content, and the repetitiveness of it. It does show potential for future projects in the VR universe though, especially in the Star Trek universe. I would have liked to see them come out with DLCs for it. Great game, just wish they made more content for it.
4.0	Great game. Four Stars
4.0	"The Nintendo DS has really brought out some of the most fun and delightful video games on the market right now. Although the PSP has been more about gloss and the ability to play movies, the DS has brought out much more excitement in the video games. That has definitely happened with the Mario franchise too for DS owners. With the success of New Super Mario Brothers last year, die hard gamers really wanted a return for their cute dinosaur friend Yoshi too. Unfortunately, Yoshi was out of the picture. Nevertheless, die hard fans have waited over a year to see Mario's friend return in another great classic. This time, it is on his own.

Yoshi's Island DS return the classic feeling of Yoshi and his baby companions Mario, Donkey Kong, Peach and Wario, as they help Yoshi and his pals try to rescue Baby Luigi from the clutches of Bowser and his minions. The graphics are absolutely amazing, and bring back the feeling of what the game originally brought out from the Super NES era, and again on the Game Boy Advance. There are over 60 levels of platforming action that are absolutely amazing, and really challenge you at times as you work your way during the game. Yoshi also has to battle enemies like he always does by swallowing villains and turning them into eggs, or by stomping and pounding them to the ground. The gameplay is absolutely addictive, and brings out a great deal of challenge. There is one disadvantage, the music is cute, but at times can be a bit tiring. Still, it doesn't interupt the challenge of the game. Along the way, Yoshi and the gang also earn 1-ups, as well as minigames to unlock from a concentration card match, to roulette, and a flutter jump contest.

All in all, Yoshi's Island DS is a delightful game for any Nintendo DS owner, and longtime fan of the Mario games. I really love this game, because it is a whole lot of fun to play and really challenging. I definitely recommend this game for anybody who owns a Nintendo DS. If you don't think so, Yoshi might egg you, not really!!!

4.0	"It is better than Red alert 1 and that is a very easy mission to
accomplice.
The good part in this game is that you can put soldiers inside buildings.
But the first game in this series is the best one.
Buy it, i'm not stopping you. C&C part one is better"
4.0	Good condition Four Stars
4.0	"I know, my title sounds like a tagline or sound bite for the game. But it's not, that's just how I feel about the game.

I originally played the game on a 6000+ AMD 64x2 Dual Core machine, and it was barely passable. No amount of dialing down the graphics or closing processes in memory would give me much in the way of framerate...it's really that horrible of a console port. But it was still fun for me.

HOWEVER. I upgraded to a heftier machine, a quad core 3.2GHz AMD Phenom II x4 955 processor, and that made a heck of a lot of difference. Now, I can even try out the racing games (driving was hard!). In my experience, the reason the controls seem wonky or nonresponsive if you don't have a top of the line system is because it just doesn't register for a second...just enough for you to overcompensate. With a fast system and decent video card, most of these troubles clear up. The game seems to care more about processor power than video card power.

So, I got a copy for my wife and we had a blast playing on LAN...I suspect she likes it better than most MMOs we've played (she only has a dual core machine, but she has no problems leaving the driving to me while she rides shotgun).

I can completely understand why, because my own favorite part of the game hasn't been replicated in any MMO I've played: the AI of the NPCs (pedestrians, cops, gangers). If gangers clip a cop car while making a turn, for example, you'll see the cops turn on their lights and all of a sudden, there's a car chase and gunfight raging down the street. Sometimes you'll be standing at an intersection and a car comes off the highway ramp too fast... quickly causing a pileup. I love that kind of world where things can happen without you being involved...it's so much more immersive. The fact that you can enjoy this with a friend via co-op online or lan is a great bonus!

Add into that some very innovative minigames using a very versatile engine, and you realize even more how disappointing the pc port is, as it really could have made waves in the PC market. It's sad that it takes two years of future technology to be able to play the game, but at least it's happening. Fantastic voicework from the likes of Daniel Dae Kim, Michael Dorn (Worf!!), Jaime Pressly, Eliza Dushku (totally worth it just to hear her say 'Bukkake Ninja'), Jay Mohr as well as several great storylines and cinematics makes it one of the most innovative, fun experiences I've had for a while. Assuming you have a quad core system (standard disclaimer).

I played this on a Windows 7 system, 4GB RAM and an NVIDIA GTX 275, with both mouse and keyboard as well as an XBox 360 controller; all work fine once you get used it (i.e., no mouse control on menus). Highly entertaining co-op fun!"
4.0	"Overlord Raising Hell is a good game if you like to command units to do your bidding.

In this game you need to reclaim your dark kingdom because your castle has been destroyed by some meddlesome heroes. They killed your predecessor so now you need to take over your kingdom once again. In the beginning of your game you go in search of your different types of minions because they have been scattered over the world. If you are good at strategy games you will re conquer your kingdom in no time but you need to have patience. The game sometimes gets challenging because you will be travelling through large lands and sometimes it seems like a maze. The game gets fun when your minions clash with large groups of enemies. Sometimes your minion horde is totally destroyed then you will find yourself fighting for your life so you should always have your best weapon handy.

 There are 4 kinds of minions that you can command.

- Brown minions are your main fighters and they can take the most damage so you would want to have more of them than any other unit.
- Green minions are smelly creatures but they are very sneaky while guarding. They are almost unnoticeable if only they could take a bath so you may not want them to guard against animals. They are also the only unit that can get rid of plants that give off noxious fumes that kill any other minion.
- Blue minions can cross water and are the only minions that can any other unit would drown they are very magical and can raise dead minions if you get them there in time. They are horrible fighters but if you fight spirits like wisps or ghosts they are the only unit that can combat them.
- Red minions are fiery creatures that can throw fire balls at enemies. They are good at killing unarmed units because they can light them on fire. Red minions are the only unit that can extinguish flames that would kill any other unit.

If you use your minions and weapons right you will find yourself becoming a very powerful overlord.

4.0	"I'm a fan of the Final Fantasy series and when I had heard that it was coming out for the DS, I was very excited. However, I was a bit dismayed at the price of $40.00 for a DS game. I'm actually glad I didn't buy this game for the full price (bought it for $29.99).

Unlike other FF games, this is a real time strategy meaning that you have to create your own troops and give them actions (similar to games like Starcraft and Warcraft). It's much more complicated than the regular turn based strategy FF games usually have in store for gamers. Like all other Final Fantasy games, the production values are gorgeous - cutscenes, music, etc. However, the actual gameplay graphics are cartoonish and seem very pixelated. I wasn't impressed in that department. The story like all other FF stories is pretty good.

I've never played FF12 (but do plan to do so in the future) and I found myself enjoying the game nonetheless. In the beginning, I was a bit turned off by the gameplay but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty easy. The difficulty varies - some missions are almost impossible, while some are too easy. Leveling up helps to some extent, but not as much since the enemies' levels increase as your groups' levels increase. The storyline progresses quickly, but you have a bunch of sidequests (that unlock espers and other items) that prolong gameplay.

I think this game is worth getting if you're a final fantasy fan, I still the think the price is way too high for it to be worth buying (unless it drops back down to $29.99). Fun game, not the typical FF gameplay"
4.0	I expected this game to be easier to maneuver, but the controls are awkward and only allow for the character to fly in certain areas. The game is good, but I would not say outstanding. At least my 3 year old enjoys flying the Night character. :) The game is good, but I would not say outstanding
4.0	For my wife who likes to play games! Four Stars
4.0	I purchased this game on Amazon for a much reduced price and I'm glad I did.  The flying mechanics take some getting used to, but the overall game is polished and fun to play.  This flying/shooting game is a recommended title for the PS3! Fun Sci-Fi game worthy of a try
4.0	THis game invented stealth to the gaming industry. Plus, it porved that you could be a badass in a video game. Unfortuantly, no one who has played MGS2 is gonna go play MGS1. And that's a shame, because MGS1 almost beats the 2nd one. Better gameplay? Yes, there's a lot more action, stealth is more important, and there's more gameplay than movie. The story's pretty normal until the end. It seems like a regular terroist movie turned into a game. However, there are some bad things compared to the 2nd one. Bad graphics, can't shoot in First person mode, and you don't have a tranquilizer. Oh well, this is Playstation 1. They improved on MGS2, but only a little. Good, but i'm spoiled to MGS2.
4.0	if your a fan of magic and/or gauntlet you will love this game.  It has a great flow and interesting attack system, I only rented but it could be a game I buy in the near future for it was fun to play and not just a simple hack and slash game, also there is a complex story behind and learning it will become a challenge in itself.  Great gameplay and graphics, very enjoyable for the right kind of fan. Good Game for Gaunlet type players
4.0	"A true representation of a next-gen game! If you've played any of the Lego games on the PS3 console, you should be familiar with the frame-rate pauses, character toggle loads and pop-ins. None of that exists on PS4 and it plays like a dream Lego game! The way they did the shiny graphics, such as the reflection on Iron Man's helmet and I swear they use particle effects on the sand to make the Sandman stage look alive. This may sound stupid because it's a family/kids game, but for me, this game shows that past gen was holding the Lego series back and hopefully will get more and more impressive with each game from now on.

I was going to rate it higher but I believe they need to re-think some of the Lego ideas. Many of the powers found in Lego Batman are rehashed in Lego Marvel. Bombs still blow up silver objects while heat and lasers blow up gold objects. I just would like some new unique powers or set pieces to destroy in the next major game they produce. LEGO nailed next-gen!"
4.0	"Honestly, I wasn't going to get this game.  Between my contempt for EA and a general feeling of ""been there"" with sandbox games, I was expecting this game to be a horrible rip-off of GTA.  However, after a great deal of procrastinating, I rented this from Gamefly and wound up keeping it.  Here's why:

The world is pretty massive.  It doesn't all take place in Paris.  In fact the map consists of Paris, the countryside and other villages and towns all connected to each other and, I might add, with no load times going from place to place.  Not only is it massive, but the graphics are pretty darn good.  While not great by the standars of what has been released, they are good enough for PS3 standards and manage to look crisp (as long as you don't look too closely during cut scenes).  I am willing to forgive even mediocre graphics in exchange for a game this large without waiting for loads in free roam.  As touched on in other reviews as well, the Sin City treatment to occupied Paris is a nice artsy flair to what may have otherwise been the same ole song and dance. To further add to the fun, the hero is well voiced with a few rather funny things being said (""It's fun, but it's murder on me hands"" while zipping down a wire bare-handed for example).  There is a bit of swearing and nudity, but if you're a mature gamer, then these shouldn't be deal breakers.

The game, while repetitive, manages to keep things pretty fresh.  Yes, the bulk of your quests involve going to point A, destroy object/free person, escape the aftermath.  However, the ability to go in guns blazing or sneaking in allows you to play each quest as you like.  However, the stealth aspect of the game is rather annoying at times since, even walking slowly, you are forced to give enemies a WIDE berth.  For them being so slick to pick you out of your disguise in short order, they are pretty stupid at the same time.  Typically, you can shoot, raise an alarm, retreat back out of range, go back to the same spot and repeat.  If they wanted the AI dumb then make it universally dumb and don't give us restrictions on how close we can walk.  Aside from this problem, however, quests are pretty fun and easy enough to figure out even on higher difficulties, but not without some retries.  Controls can be a bit fussy, but nothing you can't eventually get accustomed to.  Still, even after getting my bearings, there have been a few times where my character did something that I had no intention of doing.

There are quite a bit of GTA rip-offs including car collecting.  It's fun, but as is always the case you are at the mercy of the game if it decides to randomly place the vehicle you need in front of you.  However, Pandemic managed to make it still fun and enjoyable.  Combine this with the thousand or so free roam objects to find and/or destroy and you can enjoy yourself for a few hours without doing a single quest.

The perks are a great addition and give you something to strive for.  However, as is the case with many EA games, they give you the ability to buy your perks instead of earning them.  While not cheap, it does lessen the pride you receive for earning a perk on your own.  Be that as it may though, the system is well conceived and gives you that little extra push to experiment with different weapons.

In short, especially now that the game has been out and come down in price, anyone looking at these reviews should not hesitate to pick this game up.  The artwork combined with a solid gameplay mechanic makes this an easy bargain choice.  Make no mistake, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Rockstar should be blushing with pride.  Vive la Resistance. Impressive, But Not Without Its Flaws"
4.0	"Overall, I am happy with this stick.  Just so you know, the VF5 edition is this same exact stick with a sticker sheet in the box and VF5 sticker on the front.  Once you open it up, it is clear that it's the standard FS EX2 repackaged.

I would have preferred a face button layout that mirrors the actual 360 controller, but reassigning buttons is hardly a task.  The joystick has a square box to work in (if you're not sure what I mean, I am referring to the track beneath the surface that the stick traces), which might feel strange to some, but I don't really mind at all.  I have used it to play SF2:Turbo and SF3:3S on Live.  I was more successful with 360 degree motions and super combos in 3, but I think this is the result of a more forgiving input system for later SF titles.  The joystick sat comfortably on my lap while playing with the headset plugged in.  It may be an issue if you use voice while playing, but the clicking sound can get rather loud in the heat of battle.  It didn't bother me of course, but my friend could hear it through the mic when I tried to recover from a dizzy.  The cord length is generous enough; it seems to be about 7 feet or so.

I also tested the stick on the PC.  Upon plugging it into the USB port, XP recognized it as the FSEX2, and loaded up the appropriate drivers.  I tested it out with a few different SF titles (and a little DoDonPachi for good measure), and found that there were some issues.  Trying to do Zangief's fast lariat proved to be impossible.  When I checked the controller input screen for calibration I found that the two triggers being mapped to the face may not have been the best choice.  It seems that the XP driver recognizes the triggers as opposite analog inputs on the Z-axis.  This quirk makes it so that a press of RT followed by a press of LT will result in a net gain of 0.  It will be as if you never pressed anything.  This means that any techniques that require 3 kicks to be pressed simultaneously will be unavailable to you unless you remap the buttons.  This may be solved with a keyboard to joystick button assignment program.  I haven't tried that yet.  While this is a problem, Hori does not market the stick as PC-capable, so I guess I can't really complain.

I do feel that the 60 dollar price tag is a little steep as it doesn't quite feel like a 60 dollar product, but that does not worth picking up.  I am quite happy with it, and considering the strange absence of arcade sticks on the market, you may want to scoop it up before they disappear and you're forced to wait until the next big fighter releases for them to begin distribution again. Decent Quality for both 360 and PC, but not w/o some troubles"
4.0	I also bought this for a friend we both had the same problem *btw the bass is amazing I never felt anything like it before* every time we play something in the headset if we are in the call we can hear each other's videos playing that is the one AND only downside to this amazing headset the microphone quality is amazing for its price too There was a problem but if you don't mind it i recommend it!
4.0	"Very comfortable.  I have bad carpal tunnel in both wrists and playing the vita was killer.  This allows me to play with no pain and for a ridiculous amount of time.  It does take a few charging cycles for the internal battery to reach it's full potential and the first charge took over 8 hours.  The more you charge, the less time it takes and the longer the battery lasts.
My only complaint is that I wish there was a way to shut the charging of the vita off.  I have to remove my vita to put back in its case throughout the day, and the constant re-charging of the vita is sure to knock off a few life cycles from the battery.  It would be nice to flip or press a small button to initiate charging when my vita gets low.  Other than that if this broke I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. Very comfortable. I have bad carpal tunnel in both wrists ..."
4.0	Decent product for the price. Four Stars

4.0	"So what makes the Battlefield series so special. Battlefield  has lots of features that the other FPS don't have. Battlefield allows you to employ vehicles in combat in multiplayer. You can jump into jeeps, tanks, helicopters, airplanes, boats, etc. This makes gameplay interesting. The other important feature in Battlefield is the ability to specialize your infantry between assault troops, snipers, anti-tank, and engineers. In this way you don't just pick up different weapons on the field of battle, you get to pick your kit to suit your mission or role. Each have their abilities and weaknesses, but as a combination they are stronger.

I did notice an improvement in the graphics from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-1942/dp/B000067O0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield: 1942</a>&nbsp;(BF1942). Running through the jungle in Battlefield Vietnam (BFV)reminded me of the movie Platoon.  The nostalgic 60s music also provides great atmosphere and gets you ready to jump into the battle. The weapons are fun and extra options for the different infantry types allows for more customization. BFV land vehicles are not much better than BF1942, but the helicopters are pretty cool. Unfortunately my piloting skills are pretty poor so I had to rely on others for an airlift. But the damage the Cobra gunships can dish out with a good pilot is incredible. It also is a lot of fun to let loose with the 50 cal on the Hueys. I would say if you only want a land based game, BFV is really not for you. Most maps allow for aerial combat.

I felt the single player experience on BFV was better than BF1942. I think this type of setting is better suited to Battlefield's style of gameplay. However, the AI would at times cause frustration by having everyone going after one control point (and still not being able to take it) while I'm left to fend off all the bad guys trying to capture the other control points.

I would note that there are still an active multiplayer community. However, there are far fewer people playing BFV as there are playing BF1942. If this game does interest you, you should get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-1942-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B000BFPAPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield 1942: The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;which comes with two Battlefield 1942 expansions,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-1942-Expansion-The-Road-to-Rome/dp/B00007LVJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield 1942 Expansion: The Road to Rome</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-1942-Secret-Weapons-of-WWII-Expansion-Pack/dp/B00009V3NX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion Pack</a>&nbsp;and Battlefield Vietnam.

4.0	"Super Smash Brothers is one of the most unique ideas to hit the gaming world since first person shooters featured deathmatch.  For this game it features numerouse memorable nintendo characters such as Link, MArio, Pikachu, Samus Arron, Fox Mcloud and more in basically a battle royal.  The real fun is wehn you gather a group of friends and go into battle.  The action is almost always intense.  However I do have a few complaints about the game.
1: Character Diversity.  On the primary roster Three of the 8 basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe (Donkey Kong, Yoshi, MArio) and then Luigi as a hidden characeter.  So basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked (a royal pain in the ***) one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe.
2: Story Mode: Basically in story mode you go through variouse fights, one on one, an army of characters, tag team, handicap, so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a (What you thought I was going to spoil the ending).
So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over, however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend party. SUper Smash Brothers, a work in progress"
4.0	NICE GAME Four Stars
4.0	"I'm about half way in and I'm enjoying the experience overall, but there are many design flaws, and odd choices that keep me from giving this game a higher score, which I would probably rate at 7/10.

Pros:
1) Graphics are lovely.  Improved over the last one.  Character and area designs are nice.
2) Some likable characters.  All have good voice actors, and while the personalities may be up to personal taste I though they were mostly good.  I like Varric and Merrill the most, myself.
3) Companion uniqueness.  I thought this was a big upgrade over DA:O.  Each character now has their own unique skill group to go along with their class specific skill groups. As well as getting a passive effect for being your friend or your rival.
4) Ability trees improved.  Things are much more open in this game, more choices, more abilities.
5) Companion relationship improved.  It's more than just dumping gifts on them now.  Your actions are the main factor in getting characters to like or dislike you, which some may not think is an upgrade but I personally do.
6) Runes are simpler than before, but I think its an improvement over all.  The efficacy of your runes now depends on the item they are attached to rather than the rune itself.  So the rune you have in act one will be the same rune in act 3, but will have a better effect because the items you set them in are improved.  No more useless +1 fire damage etc, runes.

Cons:
1) Exploration:  Don't expect much.  Well to be more exact expect to re-explore constantly.  First off the areas you find while playing will ""renewed"" at the start of each act.  So if you had explored ""Lowtown"" in act one, you would have to go back to the exact same map, and re-explore because there are now new codex entries, and new crafting resources and crates/chests to find.  It doesn't seem like much, but per act you run through these areas like a dozen times it seems, so it gets real old real fast.  Secondly, and far worse is dungeon reusing.  There are only a handful of dungeon maps in the game, and they get reused and they attempt to diffuse this by often blocking off/opening up areas to make the place seem larger or smaller respectively, or having the entry point be different to change your point of view.  This is just lazy, so either they were being rushed or just didn't care to add unique areas.
On a similar note lots of reused item art as well.  In act one there are like 4 kinds of daggers, they all just have different names and each ""type"" looks the same as any other in it's type, etc.

2) Some annoying combat issues.  There were two big ones for me.  The first of which is some monsters will knock you down, then before you have a chance to move once you've gotten up, they knock you down again, until you are dead.  This is avoidable if you have other living party members to draw fire away but if you are solo, its just pretty much instant death.  This is due to a game mechanic called ""fortitude"" which goes along with the strength stat.  The ONLY class that will have any noticeable room for stats in strength is the warrior class.  That leaves the other two classes SERIOUSLY vulnerable to inescapable death.  I see what they were going for, trying to solidify class roles, but it was just too pronounced a chance at low fortitude to be chain knocked down.
The second is similar to the first, sometimes when you are attacked you become ""staggered"" (not stunned, it's just a little animation) making it so you cant move or take an action for about a second, problem is that there are times when you can be getting attacked every second so you have no chance to move or do anything to escape.  Again, party set up, luck, and situation make these avoidable but I was highly annoyed by both in several places.
Also, adding in button mashing for attack... I'm not a fan.  It doesn't add anything to the game, it just makes your thumb get tired after a while.
Running seems more effective in this game too.  Ive had several fights where I just lead the boss around, turned when my skill was refreshed and cast it, then took to running again.  Takes a while, but sort of feels like you're cheating.

3) Companion equipment.  Why.  This annoys me a lot.  No party members can equip armor of any kind.  They all come with ""built in"" armor that can be upgraded a few times.  So 2/3 of all armor you find will be useless to you (depending on which class you chose).  Varric won't even equip a different weapon!  It gets really old finding cool armor that is of 0 use to you.

4) Plot.  The game is mostly side quests.  The side quests are satisfying enough, but they are all just sort of nothing.  The main plot is not very engaging or sweeping.  There is no sense of urgency or importance.

5) Bugs.  Game freezes in dialogue not ""often"" but it happens.  Its happened to me like 4 times now, freezes the system.  Another interesting bug I got hit by went along with my complaint #2 above... At some point during a fight, everyone was dead, but Merrill and one foe, for some reason the game took the combat as being over, so every second Merrill's health bar refilled.  The lone enemy with every attack struck Merrill to the ground, then precoded to continue striking her before she could get up back, to the ground again.  So, quickly (and I was 100% powerless to stop this once it had begun) I was knocked into a corner and the foe proceeded to chain knock her down as the game healed her.  Basically the game was over at that point.  I couldn't more, drink a potion, use any kind of ability... nothing, I was just knocked down again and again and again.  Tried to weasle out of it for about 10 minutes, then gave up, and restarted.

Overall, it's fun, and worth playing, but seems really rushed and all the little improvements are overshadowed by the poor design choices and slightly boring plot.

Isn't nearly as captivating on any level as DA:O, but the core Dragon Age mechanics, and game world are still good, and make the game worth playing. Fun (with flaws) but not as engaging as Origins."
4.0	"It's a pretty decent game if you come into it with a ""Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest"" turn-based frame of mind. But you will be quite disappointed as I imagine many people have been when they first bought it a while ago.

Call it bad marketing on Konami's part which is unfortunate seeing as how the PSP has been suffering in sales quite a bit lately. Anyways the game is okay although the explanations for its gameplaying style sucks! Expect some slowdown for the amount of action going on and also look at the character cards as a sort of Final Fantasy-style ""monster-summons"" type of card, like the Roy Campbell card.

As I said before when approaching MGA think ""Final Fantasy"" and you will be alright! Metal Gear meets Final Fantasy"
4.0	YOU GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. ONE SHOT AND YOUR DEAD LIKE IN REAL LIFE.THE GAME SORT OF REMINDS ME OF THE DELTA FORCE GAMES.IT'S A GOOD GAME. GOOD GAME
4.0	"Temple of Elemental Evil, for better or worse, is unlike any game you have ever played.  This is a true, nut-and-bolt recreation of pen and paper Dungeons and Dragons.  The rules are extremely complicated and detailed, and the game takes place in turns.  Thus, it plays more like a turn-based strategy game than past RPGs like Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter Nights.  A simple combat against five bandits might take 60 seconds in previous games, but it can take 10 minutes in this game.  In general, the pace of this game is very slow.  I think that Troika did a great job of making a game that is both faithful to D&D rules and fun, but the game is really lacking some basic features.
By now, you have probably figured out that this game is not for everyone.  It isn't.  If you don't like +1 bonuses, die rolls, and inane rules, then you are going to hate this game.  However, if you are like me and you like a lot of this stuff, then this game seems like Nirvana.  It's almost a perfect recreation of D&D, and it's very efficient.  All of the rules, feats, skills, spells, and actions have been distilled down into a simple set of menus and screens that you can access with a few mouse clicks.  For the most part, it's intuitively set up and very easy to use.  The radial menu system works great.  If you know the D&D rules well, then you will be at full speed in no time.
It's impossible to overstate what an accomplishment this is.  You just right click on a character and by navigating the mouse, you can either drink a potion from your inventory, use the ""Power attack"" feat, or cast a Magic Missile spell.  The ease of use is one of the reasons why the game stays fun.
Combat in ToEE is the most fun and satisfying part.  The battles are extremely hard and they require you to utilize all of the tactical tricks that you can think of.  The turn-based system is what allows you to do this and get anything out of it.  I enjoyed the combat in this game more than Baldurs Gate or Neverwinter Nights for this reason.  The game doesn't blow by too fast for you to use your abilities without pressing the space bar over and over.
This game has surprisingly good graphics.  The pre-rendered 2D backgrounds are simply the most beautiful that I have ever seen.  They are not only gorgeous, but full of variety.  The monsters are also richly detailed, not to mention menacing.  The monsters are also the best that I have ever seen in an RPG.  My only complaint with the graphics is how tiny your party is on the screen.  You can hardly tell your characters apart without squinting, and you can't tell what they are carrying or wearing by glancing at them.  The inventory screen is also very unattractive and the items are very bland.  Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter Nights have much more attractive inventory screens.
I love the soundtrack for this game, but the voice acting is pretty sub par.  A few of the characters have good voice acting, but for the most part, it's not very good.
This game does have some problems that slow it down unnecessarily.  One of them is the inability to set hotkeys.  Customizable hotkeys was one of the great things about Neverwinter Nights.  Unfortunately, in Temple of Elemental Evil, in order to give a command 20 times, you have to go through it in the radial menu 20 times.  It gets old.  The map screen stinks, because you can only place a limited number of flags on it, and because you can't use it to jump to a spot on the big screen,  Finally, the manual that comes in the box is totally inadequate.  You need to buy the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook to understand a lot of what is going on (if you don't already know).  I see this as being a huge flaw for someone who is not intimately familiar with the rules.
I really enjoyed this game, and I hope that we will see more Dungeons and Dragons games from Troika.  As I said previously it is not for everyone.  If you like planning and strategy, then I think that you will like this game.  You might want to get a strategy guide with it, because this is also the hardest D&D game ever made. Promising, but lacking some basics"
4.0	great game the only problem I had was the fact that the game ended to soon. the kill the actual boss of the game you have to buy DLC great game the only problem I had was the fact ...
4.0	"I have many of these Pop Cap hidden object games, and enjoy them all immensely.  That is why I was excited by this new game.  So far, I'm disappointed.  I have installed, uninstalled, and re-installed this game, and I'm still having problems getting it to run properly.  I have not yet sat on the phone with customer support to try and diagnose the problem, so I'm hoping that the game will be worth it after that.  The graphics, as usual, are stunning.

August 7, 2011 update:  I have finally fixed the issues I had with playing this game, and I'm pleased to say that I enjoy it as much as I have always enjoyed the Pop Cap Hidden Object games. Not compatible with Vista?  It is now..."
4.0	Work good Good
4.0	This was a good variety of games that my family enjoyed.  I would buy more in a set if offered. A good assortment of games.
4.0	"Ive been waiting for this game for years. I was very pleased to see the positive press it was getting so It reinforced my immediate release day purchase. Its refreshing to see a 3rd Person shooter with a current day setting. The FPS market is WAY too saturated IMHO..

The graphics are very well done with lighting, textures weather effects. Animations are very smooth with just a couple of rough spots (cover leaping looks stiff) It's all here, cover, close melee, upclose executions on dazzed/injured enemies. (no stealth kills yet for player)

The sound effects of battle and the emotions of the men screaming in conflict are a complete masterpiece. The voice work is top notch (albiet Nolan North seems to be everywhere in Gamedom) The banter of your team really Gels and you get a genuine feeling of human interaction.

The sounds of the weapons could've been a little deeper/richer. I didn't quite feel the weight or power of my .50 Desert Eagle or Assault Rifle (although the damage it causes is viceral).

The story was immediately transparent to me as I played through the game. Maybe it is because Ive watched and played so many of its inspiration sources? Maybe. At some points the game feels like its trying to hard and it comes across contrived to make a point. I also did not understand the conflict of the main character. I can't give an indepth opinion as It would spoil the Story. Perhaps one of my basic rules blurred the games intent: You point a weapon at me to cause my person harm no matter your origin and you'll you'll hit the ground first. Don't put your trust in no one.

Over all this game is amazing and Im truly enjoying this unique experience through the eyes of this Soldier. My complaints are somewhat nit picky but stood out to me. Its a game right? YES. And its fun and intense!

Warning to Parents!! This game is NOT. REPEAT. NOT for children in any capacity. This was only one of a very few games Ive seen dead children in. The profanity is strong as is the violence. Great Military 3rd Person action shooter."
4.0	I bought this game when it came out, it was just ok Im just waiting for the next SC to come out!!! Good but not great...
4.0	I bought this game for my girlfiend's son to play on his new XBOX One. He loved it!!! 5 star purchase. Good game...
4.0	This game has a unique style and is pretty good overall.  Main issue is that it gets real repetitive and drags on way longer than it should. Its fun though and has alot of unique parts.  Pretty good game for the price. This game has a unique style and is pretty good overall
4.0	"I often travel 2-3 days a week and wanted a way to play without lugging my PS4 around (which I actually did a few times). So I bought a PS Vita. I don't do much gaming on Vita specific games. 95% of my Vita usage is remote playing my PS4 games

The device:
The device itself is a good size and rests nicely in your hands. The screen size is good and the picture is crisp and clear. The button arrangement is a bit uncomfortable for me. The right joystick doesn't seem to be in a very natural position and there is a lack of L1/R1 and L3/R3 buttons. I play Final Fantasy XIV: ARR and those buttons are pretty essential. To use those buttons you have to make use of the touchpad on the back of the device which takes a bit of getting used to. if you touch the upper right side of the back touchpad its like pressing R1, the bottom left is like L3 and so on.

Remote play:
This is why I bought the Vita. If your PS4 is in standby mode (rest mode not off) then the Vita can turn it on and operate it remotely. There are 2 different ways you can do this, at home via direct connect and away from home via the internet. If your home you can connect directly to the PS4 via a bluetooth connection. If your family needs the TV or you want to multitask and watch and play at the same time, you can play the PS4 using the Vita as controller and screen leaving your TV screen available to watch TV. If your away from home you can connect via the internet. I have used the Vita to play my PS4 remotely from several states away from home. The only thing you need to watch for is bad internet connections. Using hotel wifi can be hit or miss, and I've used stronger wifi connections that had trouble when someone else was using Netlix it hurt my Vita's connection. If connection is lost for Vita, the PS4 is still on, so when the vita regains connection a few seconds later your right back to where you were (or dead depending on the game!). Depending on the connection there can be slight lag using remote play.

If a game bundle is available you want to buy that version. The Borderlands 2 edition comes with a game and an 8GB memory card for the exact same price Remote play is awesome!"
4.0	"Like the description says, this is a collection of three Metal Gear Solid games. It contains the original Playstation version of Metal Gear Solid, as well as the two director's cut versions of the Playstation 2 installments of  the series - Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance and Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence.

When I say the collection contains the original Playstation version of Metal Gear Solid, I really mean the original Playstation. This is surprising considering the age of that system and the fact it's on two discs. A PS2 port would have allowed players to rely on a PS2 memory card and allowed the game to fit on one disc. If you don't have a PS1 memory card, you're out of luck. Fortunately, the game is playable on the PS3 using the system's built-in memory card feature.

All three games are, as the boxes say, ""tactical espionage action"" games. You can try to blast your way through the enemies, but that really isn't very bright. If you're seen by an enemy, they'll call for help, and from that point on, an endless stream of enemies will come to find you. If you're able to successfully hide long enough, however, the enemies will return to their posts.

MGS is the simplest of the games, relying primarily on an overhead view to essentially make the gameplay 2D. You can't shoot in first-person, but Snake does automatically track his targets. In addition to the main game, MGS also has a VR Training mode, where you not only learn a few basics, but can also challenge yourself to obtain better times in each of the ten courses.

MGS2: Substance, greatly improves on the gameplay by adding the abilities to shoot in first-person, climb small boxes, dive, shoot from cover, and hang from ledges. Soldiers can also be shot in different parts of the body for different effects. A head shot will kill an enemy in one hit, but aiming for the body will require you to use more ammo. Substance also has a great deal of bonuses. There's a VR training mode, greatly improved from MGS. Initially, you can play as either Snake or Raiden, and as you complete more courses, new characters are unlocked. While the course layouts remain the same for each character, enemy placement changes to provide varying levels of difficulty. In addition to a Stealth and Eliminate All Enemies mode, the VR training also provides weapon training courses where you use the games many weapons to destroy targets. Another of Substance's game play modes is Snake Tales, where you play through the Big Shell, one of the game's areas, as Snake instead of Raiden. Finally, an amusing skateboarding mode turns the Big Shell into a sort of Tony Hawk Pro Skater course allowing you to skate through with Snake or Raiden in an attempt to complete various tasks and earn points for performing various skating tricks.

Finally, MGS3: Subsistence takes you back in time to the 1960's where you play as Snake's father, Naked Snake. In the Soviet jungles, Naked Snake has to use camouflage and his survival techniques to infiltrate enemy bases. The game requires that you treat your injuries and keep your stamina up by eating food. This means you have to hunt for food and raid enemy storage houses for medical supplies. Naked Snake also knows a fighting style known as close-quarter combat (CQC). This allows Snake to grab enemies and perform a variety of moves from there, including interrogation, using the enemy as a shield while you fire on his comrades, or just plain slamming him into the ground and knocking him unconscious. The abilities granted by CQC add a new dimension to the game that makes fighting your way through enemy bases much more feasible.

The games are fun to play once you're accustomed to the controls. Substance and Subsistence have so many controls, that they are overwhelming to new MGS players. If you take the time to learn them, though, you'll find deep games with an endless amount of possibilities. A Solid Collection for the MGS Fan"
4.0	Fun online play Great
4.0	Speaking as an owner of all of the previous Tony Hawk games for N64 and Gamecube, Tony Hawk 4 makes some drastic changes for the better.  I can't say that the graphics are stunning, because they seem the same or just a tad better than THPS 3, but I can say that taking out that rediculous time limit that was old after the first game was a great idea.  Other new ideas are the long awaited spine transfer, the idea of Pro Challenges which is one challenge that is unique to each individual skater (which is how you unlock the movies in this one)and the way that you have to talk to people to unlock goals, almost exactly like in the game Aggressive Inline.  Although some goals are rediculously hard and frustrating, you can buy cheats for not much cash that will help you out greatly.  Speaking of the cash, it is skattered all over the level like in THPS 2.  To get more special trick slots, you must complete certain goals on each level that have to do with doing special tricks in insane places like doing a special trick over a huge gap or something along those lines.  You have to buy the special characters, the cheats, and the movies that do not feature a skater.  A change in the gameplay is the addition of new flatground moves.  If you have seen Rodney Mullen's video from THPS 3, you were amazed.  Now, you can do all those moves and more without moving in the game, such as pogos, casper flips, handstands, or handstand flips to name a few.  You can use these to get your special meter up also, which is very handy in tight places.  The multiplayer mode in the Tony Hawk series has never been great, but it keeps up the good work with new modes you can play in.  Overall, with huge, great levels, new ideas, fun goals, and long movies, Tony Hawk 4 is still a must have for anyone who owns a system that supports it. expanding, expanding...
4.0	"Loved this game but there's a steep learning curve and frankly I didn't have the patience.  : (

Starts off awesome, tactically using round-based fighting to battle aliens and save civilians.  The maps are automatically generated so you never truly play the same battle twice.  And once you get the hang of building up your research base and accruing new skills and technology, the aliens unleash something new that you have to revisit your entire strategy.  Unfortunately by then, your best recruits will likely be dead and it will be like starting the game over essentially.  Meanwhile they are invading other countries and continents begin dropping out of your team making your job harder and harder.  I didn't wait around to get overrun after the difficulty (and spending 45-60 minutes per mission just to get slaughtered in one or two turns at the end) outweighed the fun.  It's a shame because it's a great game, I just wish the difficulty wasn't as brutal and off-putting. Spoiler Alert: The aliens are gonna kill a lot of your people"
4.0	The only bad thing about this game is that you have to increase your bounty level making police try to catch you. Its cool at the beggining but when you are at top 5 in blacklist, things get boring. Its very cool, the only complain its the bounty

4.0	"I'm fairly mixed as far as my opinion about this game goes. If this is your first foray into the Mama game franchise, it's not an awful place to start but the problem is that the franchise has done this before and done far better than GM2:FF.

On the plus side, there are a lot of things here that players will absolutely adore. You can customize your garden to suit your personal tastes, as there are a multitude of different things you can use to get it to that specific look. This will undoubtedly please people who dislike having a typical cookie cutter display. The other good thing is that there are a wide variety of plants to grow, all of which fit into three basic types of plants: flowers, veggies, and fruit. The little mini-games are also fun and while they're fairly limited, they mostly fit in with what people have come to expect from the Mama franchise.

Unfortunately there are a few things that detract from the title as a whole. The first issue is that the game is a little limited in what it offers people. The 3D aspect of this doesn't really offer much in the way of a bonus. It's not that users will really expect awesome 3D graphics from a Mama game, but this feels like it could have been released on the regular DS years ago and without losing terribly much. It also doesn't help that at times the game controls feel a little off, especially when you get that one specific mini-game that is incredibly difficult to complete at 100%. Since most of the games are almost insanely easy, this isn't really a big issue. However there's the other problem: whereas in previous games you would have millions of little mini-games that come up, this is actually fairly limited in what it has to offer. It's fun, but at the same time I couldn't help but feel that this would have been better if it'd started at the twenty dollar price point. The full thirty dollar price is a bit much, considering what you get from this in comparison to other Mama games.

I guess in the end the most frustrating aspect of this was that it really, really came across like it was targeted to very young players. It's fun and people of all ages can and likely will enjoy it, but this is the first game in the Mama series that really came across as a child's game. I definitely recommend it to fans of the series since what they do have is pretty darn fun and can be addicting, but many of you will probably be happier if you wait for a previously used copy to hit the shelves. Good depending on your age"

4.0	"Has TONS of wasted potential. This game can easily become a classic ... if the story is being told in a better way (Such as more cut scenes or reorganizing some story sequence). Many players are frustrated that those epic moment shown in the trailers are 90%  being cut out from the game. It feels the trailers are misleading advertisement.

Now, why the game is worth a 4 stars. It is still a fun game with a beautiful massive opened world. It is awesome to see lives and animals are interacting themselves in the game. I did have fun with all the hunts and side quests. I leveled to lv 70 easily and being overpowered. The game has replay value since there are hidden dungeons inside dungeons (you will know what I mean when you play the game).

Good news is that 70% of the FFXV workforce is still working on this game's future update and DLCs. It has new content delivering on monthly basis. Most people complained about slow-paced Chapter 13 which will be fixed with the 3/26/17 patch. Recently, there is a survey about FFXV on facebook for user to express their concerns. I still have hope that SE will listen to our voice and adjust the game accordingly.....just like SE recreated FFXIV into an awesome game. I don't mean SE will remake the game as a whole. However, I believe small fix here and there will bring this game to another level. According to the director, 2017 is the year of given back. The team will still work on this game at least for one year. Also, this game is a good practicing tool for the upcoming FF7 remake. It does has its value.

In short, this is a fun action-JRPG. Howeve, at this moment, this is the most broken storytelling in the whole Final Fantasy series. Has TONS of wasted potential. This game can easily become a classic"
4.0	"The video gaming industry continues to grow and grow, and this game is proof of that.  With gorgeous graphics and a wildly structured game play experience, ""Hitman 2: Silent Assassin"" for PS2 is an interesting game that is unpredictable and overall satisfying.  You never know what will happen next once you pop this game into your PS2 console.
You are a legendary assassin, only known as ""47.""  People have no idea if you're real or only a myth.  Your violence is well known in the world of crime.  But, you've been out of the professional killing occupation for quite some time, trying to find redemption and peace.  You hope you can start a new life and do good instead of bad.  Things change when your pal, a friendly priest who does his best to guide you into a better life, is kidnapped by a notorious crime family and is holding him for ransom.  Now, you must reluctantly dig up your past as a notorious killer and do what you do best.  You'll have to work on a various assortment of missions if you hope to get your friend back alive.  It's time to show this crime family that it was a big mistake to get Agent 47 upset--VERY upset.
The game is very entertaining and fun.  While it may not be as addicting as ""Grand Theft Auto 3"" or games like that, it still opens your curiosity to a breed of game playing that you have never experienced before.  The missions are open, for the most part, and offer a number of ways for you to carry them out.  You can be a stealth ghost, or a madman killer with violent outbursts.  Be forewarned that a lot of the missions require care and speed.  Too much of a violent outburst from you can cost you the mission--or worse, your life.  You have an assortment of weapons at your disposal (a cool one is the fiber wire that allows you to ""quietly"" shut up your enemies), and you are able to assume the identity of your most unfortunate victims.
The controls take a bit of time to get used to, but you get familiar with it all the more you play it.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, leaving it easy for you to get quickly sucked into your surroundings.  A downfall of the game is that it is a very strategic game, meaning that you can't just always run out with guns blazing.  This is usually the type of gaming I like, so it's taking me a while to get used to it.  The difficulty of the game is pretty tough, no matter what difficulty settings you have it on.  Some may find this extremely frustrating while others may find it satisfying.  It all depends on what kind of a gamer you are; the strategic kind, or the violent maniac kind.
Be warned; this is in no way a game for YOUNGER PLAYERS.  The game is rated ""M"" for ""Mature,"" and it is rated that for good reason.  Not only does it involve you being a cold killer, but the game also includes strong language, violence, and mature themes and situations.  This is definitely not for children.  This game is intended for older players and adults.
Overall, ""Hitman 2: Silent Assassin"" for the PS2 is a pretty good time, offering you a different type of a video game experience.  While it may be a tough and complicated game to get used to, it's still a fun time and offers a unique style of gaming.  What will you do, Agent 47?  Are you ready to go back to the violent life that you swore to leave?  If you want you buddy back alive and unharmed, you're going to have to put your game face on and return to the deadly and violent life of contract killing.  It's time to put the fear back into those who wish to do you harm.  It's time to reopen shop and be back in business. -Michael Crane Guess Who's Back in Town..."
4.0	"Its a classic game alright.  Interesting story about adventure island.  From wikipedia:

The player controls Master Higgins, a young man who ventured to Adventure Island in the South Pacific after hearing that the Evil Witch Doctor kidnapped Princess Leilani. To rescue her, Higgins must survive a series of 32 stages. There are eight worlds called ""areas"", which are divided four stages or ""rounds"" each, which are further divided into four checkpoints. When the player reaches the fourth round of each area, he must confront a boss at the end to continue to the next area. The game is completed when the player saves the girl after defeating the eighth and final form of the evil lord.

Wikipedia has some interesting stuff on this, its worth reading.

I gave it four stars because i love playing it but this game alone was the reason i went through so many NES consoles and controllers as a child.  My brothers were good, i was awful.  I recommend to anyone who loves classic NES. Master Higgins"
4.0	"There are two sections that make bioshock infinite unique and worth playing: 1) seeing Columbia for the first time and taking it all in.  2) The ending is just off the charts.  The rest of the game is an average shooter with interesting mechanics that get your attention but don't inspire to experiment around with the weapons and powers available.  The middle part of the game can get boring at times, and the game is not long, so a rental can be enough to finish it.  There are story elements that i wanted to see developed and answered, but they were just mentioned and forgotten unfortunately.
Good game, unique story and overall average gameplay. Has enough to be remember as unique story, average game overall"
4.0	Got the game for less then ten dollars. Its pretty good the gameplay is where its at but the story is boring and predictable. Casting spells with the stylus is neat and the combat is all real time so you awlays have to stay attentive as you die pretty quick. Its an rpg and action adventure and a little bit of rts blended into one. It has three endings, and wi-fi battles but haven't found a single person playing. Good game, worth it for the cheap prices you can find now. not a bad game for the price

Great production values through and through. Fabulous rendered cinemas, loads of voice-acting, a slick interface and dozens of unlockables. Some load times, forced dialog trees.

Graphics
Good style and strong technology combine for pretty results. Big, varied environments and an amazing sense of speed. Runs at 30 frames and under, a disappointment.

Sound
Thank you, almighty gods: Sonic Team has finally ditched the horrific 80s' guitar rock for a beautiful, memorable soundtrack filled with worldly music. What an improvement!

Gameplay
This one's hard to rate. Separated, the daytime levels are worth a full point and a half higher; the nighttime stages two or three points lower. An addictive game by day and a boring one by night.

Lasting Appeal
A lengthy single-player mode will last upward of 12 hours and there's plenty to come back for, including a host of unlockables and lots of collectibles. Fans will be pleased. Good Action"

4.0	"Bought these to use with my Playstation 4.  Sound quality is good, the in-line controls are easy to use on a whim, and they look great.

However, I cannot use this headset for an extended period of time. The combination of the tension of the ""squeezing"" and the size of the ear cups is enough to leave me in pain after a couple hours of gaming.  This may not be an issue for everyone, but since my earlobes are stretched, I'm forced to let the headset sit unevenly on my ears which ultimately leaves my ears sore 30 minutes to an hour after use.

I sold my pair to a friend who fit them better, but it's something to be aware of for users with ""large ears."" Very promising headset, but not for people with big ears."

Anyways, I probablt don't need to say that I liked this because it reminded me of Spyro, Ty, and a little of Klonoa. I didn't buy it because I got stuck and couldn't get past a part; this was a few years ago. :) Ice Skating!"
4.0	"The Good: Beautiful and stunning graphics and soundtrack, excellent cinematic combat, great controls and acrobatics, open world is very well designed, amazing story

The Bad: Combat and exploration gets tedious towards the end, that damn cliffhanger ending

The Sands of Time trilogy was probably one of the best games series ever made, let alone a few diverse series, with each game completely evolving from each other. When the series started with The Sands of Time every completely freaked out on their consoles with the game's great acrobatic moves, enticing story, and beautiful graphics. The game just felt so good and played so well the controller almost melted in your hand. With the return in Warrior Within the Prince kind of went to the dark side with a grungy, heavy metal, gory sequel that was either a hate or love it type thing. I however considered that one my favorite, but fans were pleased again with Two Thrones when the Prince actually got a dark side and went back to the style of the first game. If you loved this game you should go back and play the previous trilogy because I promise you'll fall in love with it.

The PoP we are playing has a completely different story, and hell the Prince isn't even a prince; he's a thief who wound up in the wrong place at the wrong time whilst running into Princess Elika. The Prince and Elika are major roles in this wonderfully made game and it all actually works. The first thing I need to explain is that the core of the gameplay is like the previous PoP games with the whole acrobatic aspect still intact. However the Prince now has a Gauntlet that he uses to help him with all of this. The controls have been simplified where everything is just one button press...yes let go of that analog stick because you just use it to point the Prince where you want to go; not guide him. He can run across walls, run up walls, swing around poles, climb on vines, shimmy across ledges etc. The game controls so incredibly well with a few minor issues you really won't hate the controls. Another major change is the game is open world so you can go anywhere you want in this humongous world.

The point of the game is to stop Arihman from destroying the world with Corruption and in turn save Elika's father Ormazd. While there are over 30 areas to explore you can go to them however you want using the acrobatic moves. Yes this can get tedious after awhile because once you discover everything you'll have to backtrack to the Temple to acquire new powers. These are four powers that are activated on various colored power plates on walls and they are key to access new Fertile Grounds. Each section is a ""mini-level"" with various obstacles to cross and just before a fertile ground is a boss fight. Navigating the world can be a bit confusing in the beginning since you'll be relying on a ""compass"" that'll guide you to where you want to go depeneding on what area you selected on your map. The point of healing each area is to rid of the Corruption killing that piece of land. Of course you can't touch this corruption or you well...you don't die in this game. Elika saves you if you fall off a ledge so consider any flat ground a checkpoint.

During combat you can not die either and you may think this is absurd, but it is a blessing. Trying to find Light Seeds (after you heal a ground you go back and collect these to gain new powers) can be kind of hard so you jump off a cliff to reach one and if you fail no big deal. This is better than restarting a level, but of course if it's open world you can't technically restart a level. Elika is also a big part of your acrobatics because if you can't reach a ledge you press Y when you jump and she'll give you a boost. This is also true in combat where she is basically your ""magic"" attack. Moving through the levels is fairly easy and I didn't once have to resort to a FAQ of any kind. The compass is a great way to find out where to go since it's a little light that kind of goes along a path and you can follow it. Of course find all 1001 Light Seeds isn't necessary since you'll find plenty to acquire all powers without having to hunt and search for each seed.

Now when it comes to combat you're in for quite a treat since combat is very cinematic. Everything is ""one-on-one"" and each enemy has a life bar that you much deplete. You have four major attacks: Magic, Acrobatic, Grab, and Sword. You can combine any four of these to make huge combos. Of course the corruption plays a huge role, so if the enemy changes status you can only use a certain attack to break through it. While each character technically plays the same you have to use time button presses to fend off their attacks. This can make things fun and challenging at the same time. The combat is very rewarding with the dramatic sweeping camera angles and beautifully scored music. Of course after awhile it starts feeling really old, but not enough to really bore you since it always keeps you on your toes.

If you want to talk about cosmetics PoP is probably one of the best looking games ever made so far. The game is just stunningly beautiful and there are high perches you can stand on and just look out to this beautiful vista that is amazingly rendered in real time. I don't know how Ubi did it but they pulled some amazing stuff to get the game to look the way it does. The soundtrack is really stunning as well (even though there's not much of it), and the voice acting is top notch and you really in love with these two characters and they struggle with the world around them and with each other. The Prince tends to be a sarcastic hot headed wanna-be hero and Elika is a confused woman/goodie two-shoes who is always putting the Prince's fire out. There are so many amazing elements to PoP you just have to play it to really know it all. With a great cliffhanger ending, a great way to control the ending, great controls, cinematic combat, and beautiful graphics you will spend a good 10 to 12 hours exploring this world. A great reboot of a tired series"
4.0	"It works great with PS4.  The packaging is top notch, feels very high quality.  I find it very comfortable, not having any issues wearing it for several hours at a time.  At the moment until Sony adds Bluetooth support you will have to connect headset to your PS4 controller to utilize its chat features, but they work well.

I upgraded from the Official Sony Playstation Headset.  The headset is sleeker, and more comfortable.  The sound is much better with very good surround sound.  The sound is clear and crisp.  Comparing it to Astro A50 its volume is softer and more plain.  However I feel it will last longer then an Astro A50 (mine broke after 6 months of use).

I would purchase it again. Great overall Surround Sound Headset for PS4"
4.0	"This is the fourth and latest in a series of casual games based on characters from the 2007 ABC TV series ""Women's Murder Club.""  The first three games were designed by the great Jane Jensen of early 90s' ""Gabriel Knight"" fame.  But ""Little Black Lies"" was not the work of Ms. Jensen.  It is just as good, however.  Graphics are more photo-realistic than earlier games.  It has spoken dialogs.  You play several characters as in earlier games, all part of a team of female investigators.  The staple of this kind of games, the hidden-object scenes, are all well done and should satify any fan of the genre.  The mini-games are fine too, and they offer a nice variety of activities, from knitting a yarn to using a microscope.  Upon finishing the game, don't forget to play the ""Epilogue"" (more like a prologue), which lets you play a brief scene as yet another character.  The game also comes with soundtracks and wallpapers as bonus features.  The story in the game is well-told, revolving around 30 years of ""secrets and lies"" in a small town beset with cult activities, hatred, and jealousy.  When the best friend of one of the female investigators dies while visiting the town, the game's afoot to find the murderer.  I got about 6 hours of gameplay at a leisurely pace, which is about right for this kind of low-budget games. Engaging story with good hidden-object gameplay"
4.0	I recently beat Max Payne 3 and all I could say is that Rockstar certainly delivered! The only thing that kept this game from being 5/5 stars was the problem with the controls. They felt a little clunky. I didn't see why on the Xbox 360 that the painkiller button and the quick turn buttons were all next to each other. When ever I tried to heal myself I would usually turn and end up dying. Besides that there is no reason miss this game as it is a welcoming of fresh air in an industry dominated by shooters focused on little story. Rockstar can make games besides GTA!
4.0	"Okami rates among the most beautiful games I've ever seen.

The main point of the game is that you're the reincarnation of a god, awakened after a hundred years to dispatch of the evil that's overtaken the land. The entire landscape is bleak and dead--affected by the evil, and it's your task to both fight the ultimate evil, and restore the land using various techniques you learn throughout the game.

One of the really interesting aspects of the game is that, since the main character is folk tale diety (in the form of a wolf), the player can affect the environment of the game by drawing with a calligraphy brush. A circle stroke in the sky creates a sun to turn night into day. Another stroke across a dead tree brings it bursting into full bloom. A slashing stroke across your enemies cuts them.

My only minor complaint so far is that perhaps it does a little too much shepherding in terms of letting you know where to go next. However, this doesn't detract for the game overall. At the same time, the player does have a good deal of freedom--I haven't felt railroaded through the storyline at all.  Perhaps the extra guidance will make this game more accessible also for people who aren't usually gamers.

If you're looking for something visually interesting, occasionally humorous, and with very different gameplay from the usual fare, Okami is highly recommended. Beautiful and Original"

4.0	"(Note: I played the X-Box 360 version of this game.)

It's taken a while (like 10 years), but Spider-Man is finally back in a good game. And it's pretty damn good.

Full disclosure: I have played just about every non-handheld Spider-Man game since they went 3-D with the 2000 PS1 Spider-Man game. That Spider-Man game was great for its time but it was the 2004 Spider-Man 2 game that really nailed the formula, with the first open-world Manhattan setting and the first web-swinging system where the webs hit nearby buildings. But since then, all of the games have fallen short for one reason or another, usually as a result of poor design choices or horrible bugs.

Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the first game in a decade that gets it all back on track.

The first thing you'll notice is that the web-swinging is near perfect. For the first time since Web of Shadows, the web-lines connect to the nearby buildings so that you are actually swinging from a building and not from the sky. The right/left hand options were a brilliant idea, as it gives you more control of where you're swinging from. The complexities are fun: which buttons you press, when you let go, or how high or low you're swinging, or when you switch from one hand to the other, all affect different aspects of your velocity and swinging arcs. And if you want to keep it simple, you can opt to avoid the complexities by just keeping your finger on the swing button and not pressing any other buttons at all: it has the same effect of driving on automatic rather than manual. You'll swing pretty much like you did in the first game. (I like the complexities personally.)

Combat is also the best we've seen in any Spider-Man game. The countering and the stealth attacks work far more seamlessly than in the previous Amazing Spider-Man. Spidey's Spider-Sense not only allows you to passively sense danger, but you can activate a Spider-Sense visual mode that allows you to pinpoint where enemies are and even where they are looking so that you can avoid their sight, which makes stealth a more attractive option.

The side missions are more varied and are actually fun, as are the additional spider-suits. The suits each come with their own bonuses and make for a nice change of pace. I played a good portion of the game in the Miles Morales Spider-Man costume.

The game's still not perfect. First, the plot is... well, there's really no other way to put it, the plot is all over the freaking place. While the game writers wisely chose not to follow the movie plot too closely, what they did instead was throw a bunch of plot darts at a dartboard in the hope that something sticks. You start off investigating the Russian mob and... asleep already? Yeah, that's pretty much how I felt. It was so boring for the first hour that I walked away from the game and didn't go back to it for weeks. It wasn't till over an hour into the game that I came across the first super-villain, Shocker. Then there's a half-baked plot involving Kraven, the introduction of Cletus Kasady, and eventually the introduction of the Kingpin - and ultimately, Electro and the Green Goblin are tossed in almost like an afterthought. It's all very unfocused and not engrossing at all. This isn't the Arkham games where the mood and pacing were all immersive enough to make you feel invested in the stakes; nor is it Spider-Man 3 which, while a terrible game, at least had the virtue of letting you choose which storyline you wanted to play at which point. Having said all that, fortunately the gameplay and game mechanics are so damn good that you can just ignore the plot and still have fun, which is something that couldn't be said for Amazing Spider-Man 1.

There are also some annoying bugs: nowhere near as bad as previous games, but still present, and still annoying. The worst is the wall-crawling. While I would say that it is noticeably improved, you can't go from standing at a ledge to climbing down from it without jumping off and then trying to press ""Y"" as soon as possible, which is risky and haphazard when you're trying to be stealthy. (The Arkham games give you the option of pressing a button that allows you to hang from the edge of a ledge.) Sometimes the game indicates to you that you should do something (such as heal), and you'll do it thinking that it is a genuine hint, only to find that you can't do it: the worst example of this is when you are fighting Black Cat, and the heal indicator comes on, but when you try to heal the Black Cat appears out of nowhere to disrupt you. Oh, and amusingly, when you find new costumes and put them on, you still have the same scratches and tears that the previous suit had. I just find that to be hilarious.

Still, the bad does not overwhelm the good. All in all this is the best Spider-Man game in the last ten years - and one can even argue that it is the best Spider-Man game ever, though I personally thought that the PS1 Spider-Man and PS2/X-Box Spider-Man 2 games were better for their respective generations. Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not going to give Rocksteady a run for its money, nor will it attract non-Spidey fans, but if you're looking for a great Spider-Man experience then this is it. but Spider-Man is finally back in a good game. And it's pretty damn good"
4.0	Wasn't exactly what I needed but it arrived early and I can use it on other things Four Stars
4.0	So this game, Two Worlds, has had mixed reviews, and it seems that you either love it or hate it.  The game itself is a very standard 3rd person action/RPG game that doesn't really bring anything new or unique to the table.  It pretty much does most things well, good character customization, fair skill tree, and lots of loot.  The one thing this game has that is noticeable is extremely bad graphics. It was surprising to see the visuals of a current generation game be this bad.  It tries very hard to be Oblivion with the open world concept, but falls short of that hallowed game. You can traverse the countryside by horseback, unfortunately the controls for riding are almost broken to the point that it is easier to walk to your destination.  I, however gave this game a good review in that I am pretty forgiving with games and I love action/RPGs and level grinding. This game can satisfy that urge very well, just do not spend more than $10 for this game. Good action/RPG game (for the right price)
4.0	This overall a good game. Amazing graphics, amazing storyline.  AMAZING.  Not as long as I hoped since I beat the game in 2 days. good game lost concept

4.0	"I think this game is fun.

What I don't like about it is how poorly Sony made it. I also don't like that its in the PSTV white list even though the few motion controls it has are completely optional. Great trilogy, bad producer."
4.0	A very good adventure and puzzle game. I was surprised by how much fun it was. This is my first TRINE game and I enjoyed it. I recommend it. TRINE 2 is a real quest of an adventure
4.0	"Doing a simulated run-up before takeoff using the outside view is fun to watch the rudder wag back and forth using my feet.  Dinged the review one star because these don't feel like real rudder pedals nor do they sound like rudder pedals.

Flying Falcon 4.0 I noticed a definite difference in turn rate using the rudder pedals vs joystick inputs. Way better than using a joystick or keyboard for rudders."
4.0	"Pros:
-It actually works for meditation.

Cons:
-More the fault of the Kinect I think, but it can be challenging to stay properly lined up with the camera and fully relax into the meditation techniques.
-It would be great if players weren't required to progress through each mode for the first time. Overall A Very Creative And Enjoyable Title!"
4.0	this isn't too much different than the other games so be warned. if you are expecting something more. you will be disappointed. this is the classic batman game style though. and if you love that, you are all set. the flying around is helpful but otherwise very similar game to the others. a great game in the series
4.0	"So I have clocked in over 300 hours on Demon Souls, and over 500 hours on Dark Souls 1, and would easily give both previous games 5's. So I am a huge fan of the series, I have played Dark Souls 2 for about 25 hours, and taken down enough bosses to know what the game is about. I personally can say that some people are going to find that this game is honestly the best in the series for them, it adds tons of new concepts that are really great, and this is the hugest world to date, which is amazing. The animations are a bit more fluid, which is cool, and they kept a lot of the old weapons from the series, as well as adding new ones, so for players like me who are set in their ways of grabbing certain weapons first in Dark Souls 1, it's great to be able to get your bearings and know which weapons are crap and whats good for your play style, as well as some interesting surprises in weapons (there are 2 NPC's I've come across so far who take boss souls and turn them into weapons).

Now to the reason I am giving this game a 4 out of 5. In all honesty, I have already stated that the game is great, but it's just not a great game for me. While some of the changes to the series are good for the series, and I can understand why the majority of people would like them, they just aren't good for me as an individual. So I know for a fact that I will not be breaking the 100 hour mark on this game, since I am already getting kind of sick of it, and I've only played for 25 hours. I guess for me as an individual there is something about this game that's missing the same flare I really enjoyed about the previous 2 games. I played Dark Souls 1 from the time it was released all the way to a week before Dark Souls 2 was released, so I do not have a misunderstanding of how the series is. I just simply can't place my finger on what I dislike on the whole. So I'll try and explain some dislikes.

First big thing - I have these 2 rings called Ring of Life Protection. You repair them for 3k souls, and what they do is if you die with one equipped you don't lose anything. The problem? In the previous game if you died with one of these types of rings equipped you'd lose the ring. So at this point with 2 of these rings, I never run the risk of losing anything. Should I just run without the rings if it bothers me? No, I'm not an idiot so why would I do that? ;P Just was more fun when you had a true sense of loss if you weren't super careful, kept you far more on your toes. If I die now, who cares? Not like I'm losing sleep over it, and with the addition of being able to equip 4 rings instead of 2 now, you can afford to keep 1 of these rings on full time.

Second annoying thing - weapon durability has been cut dramatically, and weapons can now only be repaired (if broken) at Blacksmith's. So you really need to upgrade at LEAST 2 weapons simultaneously if you plan on playing a melee (I cannot speak for casters since I made a Warrior), I personally have 3 weapons just in case. The problem with this is that resources are scarce, and if you upgrade the wrong weapon, your stuck running with a low durability weapon for an eternity, not because you want to, but because it's your most powerful weapon (I upgraded a weapon that had low durability BEFORE I discovered how much a problem durability can be in this game, which was never the case in both previous games). Again this wouldn't be as big an issue if A: you could purchase as many Repair Powders as you wish (the Blacksmith in Majura only sells you 1) or B: they allow you to repair your own weapons at the bonfire. This also plays into the whole lack of enjoyment of exploring the levels, since your durability can be so problematic that you'll sometimes be running back to a Bonfire just so your weapons don't break.

The last thing really isn't so much a knock at the game, but more of a personal issue. I am just not a fan of the Rat Covenant, I tried exploring the Dwarf zone (it's called Gyrm's Respite) and I keep getting sucked into another players world. The problem? When your dealing with people in the Rat Covenant, they suck you into THEIR game, and I've noticed a lot of people will try and set traps for you, and just wait at the end, leaving you to have to clear out a bunch of THEIR mobs, just to get to them, and it got so bad that if I go into the 2 areas that you get summoned by the Rat Covenant, I usually just turn my PS3 to offline mode just to clear the zones, since you keep getting summoned every few minutes, and nothing is more annoying then having to clear trash just to get to some idiot who is wasting your time, and you can't exit his world until either you kill him or he kills you. This is really stupid in my opinion, because it forces you into the aggressor role, and they can just hang back and waste your time by staying very far in. This has been the case for me every time, I'm not saying EVERYONE plays like this, however the 8 times I've been summoned into another players game world, this is what I encountered. Since 8 times isn't enough to form an opinion on the entire population, I can't knock a point off for the Rat Covenant, but I can add it to the list of many reasons why I didn't like the experience.

All in all, I can't give a game made by this team anything less then a 4, but I will no longer be continuing with the series either. I hope my review has been helpful, I honestly think a lot of people will truly love this game, since you call tell they put a LOT of work into it, I just can honestly say it's not for me. You'll either love the changes or hate them"
4.0	Is a bit better than the first Tenchu, because it has bigger levels, an improved story, and a secret character. Good game, recommended. Also has lots of violence. Good and better...
4.0	luv it Four Stars
4.0	Decent game Four Stars
4.0	"Let me start this review by stating that I'm a fairly finicky gamer. I disliked Half Life: Counter Strike, immensely enjoyed the No One Lives Forever games, and was disappointed by Unreal 2 (though the game had its good merits). As much as I loved the first Unreal Tournament, after spending some quality time with UT2003, I can honestly say that this game is truly... better.
Some people disliked the game because it was too demanding of their systems. This is bull. The engine is refined. A GeForce 3 Ti card on a system with no bottlenecks will run this game smoothly with moderate visual settings, but a GeForce 3 coupled with a 1Ghz proc. is expectedly slow. Why? Because as textures are bump mapped, when volumetric fog is thrown about the maps like candy, and when the poly counts are through the bloody roof, the DEVELOPER EXPECTS PEOPLE WITH DECENT SPECS TO PICK UP THE GAME. Don't cry when your ancient rig can't hang with the new big boys.  Get a 9800 Pro or something and see what you're truly missing.
Although it is easy to be disappointed with UT2003 when you find your favorite sniping rifle or map has been removed or modified, most players will begin to appreciate the near perfect balancing scheme Digital Extremes put into place.  There are no overpowering weapons dominating the field.  New game modes like the insanely intense Bombing Run replace the game mode stripped from the original.  The addition of the double jump imposes players with addictive, arcade-feel action... causing firefights to last for minutes, not moments.  Realism isn't the deal here.  Fun is.
In conclusion, Unreal Tournament 2003 has an insane amount of content right out of the box.  The Unreal platform is fast, beautiful, updated, hip, and stable.  If you have the paltry fee required to purchase this game, then do so.  I think you'll be happy. Unreal Tournament gets an unfair rap from average users..."
4.0	Havent play it yet, but its great to have 3 games in one disc and its cheap to buy it Great Game buying
4.0	"These games are a bargain, but they are old. Here are how I rated the games:
Sim City-It is OK, it isn't really that great 3/5
Sim Tower-The one game that makes buying this worth while 5/5
Sim Isle-Can't play it so 0/5
Sim Safari-Very babyish, not really worth it 1/5
Streets of Sim City-It's OK, all though it really has a low replay value 3/5
Sim Copter-Choppy graphics, but the game itself is pretty good 4/5 It is a reasonable price..."
4.0	"Not bad and easier on the hands using the WII controller compared to the normal Playstation controllers.
Somewhat difficult controlling the car in some situations of racing...mostly the sprint races. tough but fun"
4.0	"I didn't think this game was going to be anything special, considering I've played simlar games like GTA IV, Episodes from Libert City, & Saint's Row that are all much more popular and well-known. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun this game was. It is much more than just a cheap knock-off from the first film of the legendary trilogy. Get this game, especially for the cheap price it is now on Amazon.

Pros:
-Lots of non-stop action: shooting, driving, and bombing - what more can you ask for?
-The missions are fun and have a fair amount of variety and make you feel as if you truly played a part in the story and film itself.
-Only four guns, but all cool, useful, and you can upgrade each one several times.
-Can throw explosives like cocktails and use dynamite & bombs to blow up buildings.
-Can extort and take over businesses and drug rackets and get to collect the profits at your safehouse.
-Get to take on mansions full of mobsters in order to make it your safehouse.
-Get to start mob wars and take over territories like San Andreas.
-Can carry out hits to earn some extra spending money.
-Can buy clothes and haircuts.

Cons:
-The only thing that distinguishes the enemies from one another is their colors. Besides that, they all look exactly the same.
-The prize fights were too darn hard.
-Can't drive anything but cars.
-Can't take a cab anywhere like in GTA IV. No subways or trains either.
-Can only hire one mercenary and he's pretty useless even for an AI.
-Slightly repetitive after a while.
-Graphics are standard, not great not bad.
-You won't skip all the cut scenes, but most of them. The Godfather the Game: Worth the Purchase"
4.0	Big fan of the Call of Duty Black Ops games. Enjoy the Ghosts games so far. Mainly focusing on unlocking the intel for each extinction level so I can see the whole story. Will focus on playing the main story mode after I fully unlock intel packages on each extinction level. Exspect to enjoy the main story of the game. Enjoy the Ghosts games so far
4.0	"I purchase this for use with my Samsung gear VR.  So far I have no complaints.  It pairs easily, is very responsive, and feels solid in the hand.  You would be hard pressed to tell the difference between this controller and one made by Sony or Microsoft, with the exception of the buttons.

The plastic and construction are both solid, and it plays just like any major controller.  Would recommend. Great Controller for Phones"
4.0	love game Four Stars
4.0	I went into this game thinking that it was gonna be just a devil may cry rip off with a different visual style but it turned out being so much more.  The visual style alone makes the game worthy of consideration, but the combat system is actually pretty fluid.  Within minutes of popping it into my Xbox360, I was entranced by it.  The only downside is that there really isn't that much to do in it.  There's only a couple dozen missions and three of them are basically a mini game to bang the girls of the game.  True to Suda51 though, this game should be something people play. The red-eyed demon of Suda51.
4.0	"The Sims 2 University has recieved a lot of positive hype - for adding a new dimension of gameplay to the Sims 2.  It has also received some negative feedback - people questioning its necessity to the game, or complaining about how rushed it was in its release (The Sims 2 was launched a mere 6 months earlier).

All in all, there is a new dimension of gameplay - that's for sure.  You can now choose to make your teenage sims 'grow up' into a young adult life stage, which only takes place if they decide to go to college.  You can then place your sims on one of three Maxis-built campuses, or build your own - but where they live isn't all that important as moving to a new campus is easy as pie.

From there your young adult sim goes through 8 semesters of college, with one class a day related to their major (11 in total which require you to build different skills depending on the subject).  Each semester is 72 sim hours long - and there is plenty to do in that time, from writing papers, to throwing parties, to joining sororities/frat houses, to falling in love, to streaking, to working at a local coffee/alcohol bar.

At the end of it all there are 4 new career paths, available only to those who graduate from college - natural science, show biz, artist, and paranormal.

To answer the complaint side of it all - yes, there is a question of necessity for the Sims 2 - University, but after all, it is an expansion pack...and it does expand the game and waht you can do with it.  After all, my favourite features of the new expansion pack haven't so much been the college experience (thus far) but little nuances like the following.

There are a number of new instruments added to this expansion pack - drums, bass, and a guitar.  Your sims can now 'perform' jazz, country, or rock music for tips, and even play together - synchronized - in a band format!

While we're speaking of music, the two new music channels - jazz and college rock, give us some of the best sim music ever produced.  The college rock station features actual artists who have re-recorded their songs in simlish for your sim's listening enjoyment.

The aspiration aspect of the game takes on a new level - as new aspiration slots open up as you pass through college, and the new 'influence' bar allows you to control other sims.  Not only that, but there is a lifetime aspiration.  If completed (and most can only be completed in old age trust me) your sim will achieve platinum mood status for the rest o ftheir lifetime.

Overall, the Sims 2 - University is a decent expansion pack. I've had very few bugs or errors, although I've heard of a few (but not many).  There are longer load times, especially when visiting University community lots, and yes, I think Maxis could've expanded the hairstyles/clothing more for young adults, but you can't expect them to get everything right.

If you liked the sims 2 and are looking for a new level of gameplay, then try it out.  If you are satisfied with the Sims 2 the way it is, then don't worry about it for now. Good Gameplay - Even Better Additions Overall..."
4.0	No analog controlls. No File Collection. WHAT? It was a let down. I totally forgot about this lacking since I haven't played it in years. The cutscene graphics are ace,though and the experience is a good break from creatures and zombies. Regina is so brave and interesting. Yes,I recommend it. A step back in mechanics as opposed to Resident Evil 2.
4.0	"I don't know what it is - maybe that we're on the third series, and the third incarnation of the general theme of 'night out' with The Sims, but it seems like there's a growing sense of dissatisfaction with the game as a whole that is only exacerbated by each new expansion. That's not to say there still aren't hours of gameplay to be had with each expansion, but I'll be the first to admit I'm a little tired of the 'Hot Date' / 'Nightlife' / 'Late Night' theme that this pack is touting.

Of course there are some variations on the theme. For one, downtown is no longer a separate destination from the rest of your base city. The new town that comes with the game, Bridgeport, is jam-packed with high-rise apartments, dance clubs, dive bars, and cocktail lounges, plus many of the other venues have been combined to make for a more condensed, urban experience. If you're not ready to move onto a new town, you can also just snap up some pre-built buildings and place them in your existing town. In general Bridgeport is a cool place and all of the bars are pretty neat, each with their own vibe, although in general I think the dives and the dance clubs are the most fun. The high rises are different than what existed in TS2: Apartment Life in that your sim basically lives in a predefined space within an otherwise 'empty' apartment building. There are no longer multiple apartments on a single lot to manage, just your sim's place and their neighbours, who they can attempt to meet and befriend. In short, it's basically like living in a home in the sky.

'Late Night' also incorporates the 'celebrity' aspect of TS1 'Superstar' expansion pack. Your sim can work their way up the celebrity food chain mostly by befriending or dating celebs, which earns them discounts and freebies, public notoriety, and lurking paparazzo and scandals around every corner. Truthfully being a celebrity gets to be a bit tiresome, and the way you work your way up isn't nearly as fun as it was with 'Superstar', but the freebies and discounts are nice, as is the ability to breeze into any bar you want instead of having to waste an evening trying to get into one when your celeb level isn't high enough.

The non-Sim creature introduced this time around is the return of Vampires, which are by far the best 'creature' of the TS3 series and superior to the vampires of TS2. There are quite a few vampires lurking through Bridgeport and getting turned into one isn't much of a challenge at all. Once you're a vamp, they take on a Twilight-esque pale, phosphorescent appearance complete with shimmery eyes. Unlike being a mummy as in World Adventures, being a vampire and carrying on a normal life is pretty easy. Your sim can't really spend much time outdoors during the day, and they drink blood (either from the fridge or from a willing human friend), but other than that they can have jobs and babies, gain skills super fast, have some mind control abilities, and have the ability to run like the wind through town.

Beyond that, there is one new semi-traditional career, similar to the expanded doctor career that came about with Ambitions - acting. Your sim can also form a band and play gigs around town, learn the fine art of bartending and moonlight as a mixologist, or simply live off the spoils of being a celebrity through the various opportunities that come their way. There are tons of nice new clothing items for young adult and adult men and women, mostly themed around party clothing (including formal wear, as some bars require your bar to change into their formal gear). The new furniture is generally pretty modern to suit placement in the various bars around town, and the best new items are probably the professional bars (for learning mixology) or the various new instruments - bass, drums, and piano. It's tons of fun to have a jam session with four seasoned musicians, for the record. Hot tubs and custom-shaped pools are also welcome new additions in the build / buy modes.

Overall Late Night adds just enough that I can say I've been content to spend countless hours with the game since its release. It's nice that in comparison to the first two expansions, this is an expansion you can just sort of play and not have to shake up your current sims' entire life and career choices. Fans will be happy that not all venues are rabbit holes as they were previously, and there are enough new career options to explore that if you're stuck on playing with one family, you could easily spend a few generations getting to know the full expanse of the game. I feel like the game sort of offered up portions of past games - both from TS1, TS2, and TS3 - for a mix of different things that will appeal to various players - new skills, new career paths, new adventures, new design objects, and a new look and feel for towns. The result is a game that isn't particularly strong in any one area (as World Adventures was with the introduction of questing and Ambitions with 'professions'), but a decent expansion for your day to day gameplay. Lots To Like With Late Night"
4.0	I have never played any of the other guitar heroes games and I know everyone is talking about how much fun this game is so I decided to try it out.  I was frustrated th first few times I played and just couldn't figure it out. I didn't give up though and figured the controls out it just took me a couple of times looking and sounding really bad.  Has a lot of songs but a lot of them i have never heard of before.  I had heard of some of the artists but they where theit lesser known songs(guess they didn't want to pay the big bucks for the good songs).  The game follow you from a garage band to playing big venues.  It does have some rather demonic things in the game you play a guy with horns named Lou(as in lucifer) and other references to you becoming a rock god. But it is still an addictive game but some of the demonic imagery and references  could have been left out of the game they just weren't needed. Great Game but a few Satanic references
4.0	Like this game almost as much as Black Flag if not more.  Wish it was available for Xbox One. Like this game almost as much as Black Flag if ...
4.0	I love this R six lockdown . better than the other R six games .I play on line and is a lot of fun  the only problem on line is you have to wait sometimes up 10 minutes to star the section . but still is good .single player  a very good playability. this game is ok. for commando . very good single and on-line experience
4.0	"I have not played the original Titanfall but decided to grab the TF2 deluxe edition after it dropped in price to around 20 bucks.  This game in some ways reminds of an older game, Mechwarrior, that I use to play and so I figured for the price, it was worth taking a chance on.  I am not so sure that the deluxe extras is worth paying extra for as compared to other games deluxe versions that add quite a bit more for the money but it isn't a big deal with the sale price.

I am more of a solo campaign player as opposed to multiplayer but luckily this has a pretty fun solo campaign.  There is a decent tutorial to get you started, which is great for me, since I hadnt played the first game and the previous last few games that I have been playing have been different styles of games that this one, which is more of a Call of Duty with Titans style of play.

The graphics are sharp and well done with some cool scenery along the way, especially the outdoor environments.  The game is fairly linear though and there isn't a lot of open exploration in the game.  The dialogue also is very limited with the Titan as well as there is limited interaction with the environment and other characters in the game.  This is not uncommon though with these types of shooters but at least the story and the purpose of your mission is interesting enough and there is plenty of action throughout the game to keep me entertained and enjoying the fight.  The interesting and different environments and levels are fun to play as well.  As it is though with most shooters, the solo campaign is to me a bit short.  There is a robust multiplayer game in this for those that enjoy MP more than solo campaigns.

The wall running is an interesting aspect of the game that took me a bit of time to figure out but the virtual assist helps out tremendously, especially in the beginning until I began to figure it out myself.  The ability to split off from the Titan and fight separately is pretty cool as is the variety of weapons and Titan Loadouts.

Overall, a pretty cool shooter that does a nice job at combining a COD style of gameplay with a Mechwarrior style.

4 stars A fun shooter"
4.0	"I was debated whether or not to pick this game up, and I believe I made the right choice.  The game itself seems ambitious, combining elements from many other games.  The overall feel is similar to GTA4.. climbing buildings and running on rooftops is like Assassins Creed.. running around causing mayhem and blowing up structures is like Red Faction.. returning color to freed areas reminds me of Okami.  Speaking of color, the game is very stylish and looks great.  Throw in the WWII setting and some very mature elements and you've got a very interesting game, but not one you want to let your kids play.

As far as problems, the game has a few glitches.  During cutscenes I have seen characters sliding backwards to get into position for a conversation.  Once or twice I have witnessed a vehicle appearing out of nowhere or floating in the air.  At one point I found myself underneath a building and had to kill myself in order to get out.  Despite these problems, I am very happy with this game. Great game with a few problems"
4.0	Grandbaby likes it. Rug naps.
4.0	I liked the story the multi player was a bit confusing at first im not use the third person but its fun i didn't replay it at all...i probably will but so many good games coming out too that i think this will be forgotten quickly which is to bad its a a great story! good game
4.0	Very solid entry in the series and a definite must buy for creation fans. One of the best values you can get on the Vita right now. Hours and hours of entertainment. Terrific game
4.0	"I'm the kind of person that likes games that make you as the gm. When i'm the gm in games I only like them if they are challenging no special advantages for either side and I like sports games as realistic as possible. If you are like that or similar to that it's a great idea to read this article. If not there should a lot of things you will catch that'll help you make your descision in weather or not you will by this game.
The two minute drill is a fun game which you play. The object is to score as much points as you can in two minutes.(Play for personal goals) You get three time outs and you never play defense. When you play two minute drill the smartest thing to do is to throw deep passes close to out of bounds. After you play this for a while you will notice that you have goten better at the game and that the plays you do most often on two minute drill usually will be the you will do most often in real game because you have goten used to the plays. Sorry about not going into details to the non-likers of franchise fans.
Franchise mode is only allowed for 30 years and depending on how good of a gm you are it can take a short period of time or an hour an off-season and season. (Dont watch or coach games or else stats in the game are really messed up and the game starts to become less and less realistic)To begin the game you will have either a full 42 round draft with some players left out at the end or just get your favorite team with all the players it had that year. First year you do not handle contracts in the beginining and theres no pre-season but after you've played your first game you have total control over your franchise by controlling your budget in a wise way. Before each game it's has ratings it gives for each team saying which team has a better secondary defensive line or better qb and a lot more. Before you go to your schedule you will see screen you have the ability to go and they are stats which has coach team stats, individual stats, team standings, and team rankings. The one under that is leauge news which has all-madden team, and All-Rookie team, league transactions, injury reports, team schedules, pro bowl voting, yearly awards, and player awards. Another link is manage rosters which has Player management, roster breakdown, depth chart, trade, sign player, re-sign player, and release player. Then the record book link has individual, team, and coaching records. Settings has gameplay, penalty settings, sound options, and control configuration. Last one is franchise set-up which has coach set-up and team set-up.
Anyway off with the boring things and on with the exciting things. Which gets us going into talking about the play-offs. The way you get in the play-offs is the exact same way you into the play-offs in real football. During the play-offs the players will play their butts off until there are only two teams left. And when there's two teams left there is a super bowl. Simply making it to the play-offs has a huge effect on your resame with the same to every game you play in the regular season but if you could win a super bowl with your team you practically can get any job you want unless you go 0-16 the next season. When your hired as a coach(gm)you get to make all the descisions thankfully in this game there are no Jerry Jones, George Steinbrener buting in to your desicion.(But I don't think in any game Jones or Steinbrener buts in????????????)Anyways if you get fired the only options you have is to turn off your nintendo or hope you have a good enough resame to impress some president.(Not of a country!)By the way make sure you don't blow off your money because if you do you'll be put in such a bad situation that if one person gets injured you'll have to blow off your job. Uh-oh I got to go sorry. everything you need to know"
4.0	Awesome ps2 despite it being used. It works like new, but still used. Four Stars
4.0	"I have to admit, it's not as enjoyable (at least to me) as Tomb Raider 1 & 2. This game does have much larger and more in depth worlds than the previous installments, but the fact that you can choose the order in which you complete the three worlds in between the first & last (something that, on the surface, is a pretty cool idea) makes me feel like, if I'm having trouble in one area, I'm wasting my time. I'd have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions & if I can go wherever I want, there's no real reward in completing anything.

But, I digress- still building from weapons, skill sets & basic traps/ puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand, thieving monkeys, deadly piranha swarms, a freeze-to-death meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter & more. Brings back Eidos' weird dinosaur fetish they appear to have had in the 90s full force (All three of the original Tomb Raider games have dinosaurs, as well as at least one other Eidos game from the same general time called Deathtrap Dungeon. It doesn't make sense because it's a fantasy game, but neither do the 2 T-Rexes under the Great Wall of China in Tomb Raider 2.) And the PC version, once again, has bonus levels. Search for Tomb Raider 3: The Lost Artifact if interested. is a pretty cool idea) makes me feel like"
4.0	I bought my Playstation 2 a few months ago excited by the hype. So far I've been sorely disappointed by the variety and quality of the games available. I've enjoyed Onimusha and Moto GP and that has been it up until Gran Turismo 3. This game is stunning. The graphics are incredible. I played a demo of Gran Turismo 2 on a disc from a Playstation magazine and the graphics on that game are like comparing Steamboat Willy to Akira. The cars are beautifully rendered and the lighting effects are outstanding. As far as gameplay this is a well balanced game. I consider myself a novice gamer with some middle level skill. This game isn't frustratingly hard or boringly easy. The challenge progresses easily and naturally. The earlier stages of the game are more fun because the cars are slower and a little more skill is involved. The analog controls really capture the feel of gravel crunching under your wheels in the rally races. There's a lot of fun involved in tuning the cars and each car handles with it's own unique personality. My favorites are the TVR Speed 12 and the Ford GT-40 road car. Most people into racing games probably already own this title, if you are new to video games or you aren't really a fan of racing but don't mind it I would highly recommend this game. It's worth the money and will keep you entertained for weeks. A Must Have Game For The Playstation 2
4.0	"Basically, this is a KOF 2002 clone with a bunch of tweeks to it.  What I mean by ""tweeks"" is that a good deal of the existing characters that were in 2002 had their stats modified a little bit as well as a few combo changes.  Not to mention that the new groove system for Neowave also disturbs some of the balance in the character rooster.  I won't go in depth about character tiers in this game.  Go visit some fighting game boards if you want that.  But basically, this is just a diffrent flavor of KOF 2002.  No more and no less.

Now for a few facts and tidbits about this particular version of the game.  The US XBOX version of the game is missing Angel and May Lee.  They are only in the Japanese PS2 version.  Furthermore, the Japanese PS2 version does support online play from what I see on the box.  Not to mention that the standard PS2 controller is much better suited for fighting games then the standard XBOX controller and it's fairly obvious which version is supierior.

The only problem with the PS2 import is that you either need a flip-top, slider card, or MOD Chip to play it and that the cheapest [...].

However, after saying this, if you already have a modded PS2 and are looking to pick up this game, get it imported.  It's not really because of the two extra hidden characters as it is about the PS2 being more fighter-game friendly.  It's the standard for them.  And while $35 is quite a jump compared to the price of $15, well...that's just my personal preference.  And I know for a fact that I'm not the only one that has problems with XBOX ports to 2D fighters.  And, at least, you are not paying $70-$80 for the PS2 import for King of Fighters XI, $65-$75 for the PS2 import of Samurai Shodown 0, and $60-$70 for the PS2 import of NeoGeo Battle Collosium. A brief review with some tidbits."
4.0	"There is a tiny problem with this mouse that makes it 4/5 instead of 5/5. Over time, the springy metal clip inside that handles the clicking will wear out, and eventually you will be trying to single-left-click, but the mouse hardware will instead signal a very quick double-left-click instead.

Apparently you can fix this by opening up the mouse and bending the clip a bit, but that can cause the click behavior to be a bit funny (aka, have to press a specific part of the button to get it to click). So, you'll need some trial and error to get it back to normal and working. Great mouse, but..."
4.0	"My 5 year-old daughter wanted some games to go with her new Nintendo DS Lite. It is sometimes hard to find games for young children who cannot read a lot yet.

She played this game without much assistance and it has held her attention. The few times I picked it up, it was fun but not hugely challenging (maybe because we haven't played through all of it yet.)

One of the problems that I see is that you cannot save multiple player games. This means that I need to play her game and cannot advance at my own pace without changing her play experience.

The tasks you need to complete to grow a beautiful garden are somewhat fun and require some timing and touch screen control.

The voices are rather annoying but my daughter thought they were funny.

One of my favorite sequential games similar to this is Diner Dash. It seems to be much more challenging. Somewhat Fun and Playful"
4.0	"Fast, Hard, Fun.
Less blood which it is dissapointing .
again: hard, fast, fun!!!

Buy it Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2"
4.0	I didn't buy from amazon i bought from gamestop but i preordered the day zero edition for the november release last year. The game is fun to play can be frustrating at times due to the fact its not like the other call of duty games. You can have a enemy right in front of you and you aim then they jump high in thr air and quickly kill you if you cant follow them up fast enough. The time to kill is moderate I'd say in between black ops 2 and mw3. There are some lag issues now and then the game tends to pick bad hosts and lacks host migrations mid game that would normally correct the problem. Otherwise its a good call of duty game and is better than ghosts which i also have a lot of experience with. Definitely a good buy if your in to fast paced futuristic shooter with a little taste of cod. Good game with ups and downs.
4.0	The various unlockable characters, the fatalaties, all classic characters are here in this amazing game.  I still wish to see more stage fatalaties like those similar to MK2 but a great addition to the MK series indeed. I like to play with the classic controller or GCN controller, but maybe because I am old school.  A beginner to MK will pick up the Wii controls easily and be playing like a pro in no time, but the controls in the heat of battle prove to need a more refined approach of the classic controls to play like a pro. Great Mortal Kombat addition
4.0	"Confession - I haven't played the 2008 or 2009 editions of this series.  After the 2007 game, I was satisfied enough with what I was given.  My favorite mode was the GM Mode, in which I could manage my own brand to take on the other brand for ratings.  It forced my creative juices and wannabe-booking insights to step up.

But after announcing that a new Story Design mode would be introduced into the 2010, how could I resist?  So, after playing this game to death, this is what I've concluded: ""WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2010"" is a very solid wrestling game, but it's new creativity features aren't kind to the single player anymore.

Let me say, first and foremost, multiplayer with ""WWE SvR 2010"" is going to be a blast.  The controls are better overall, and the wealth of options and match modes should make any group of friends have a blast.  I don't want to ramble too long about the match modes & features, but let me assure you that they're all very well done.  My only gripe is that 3-way Tag Team matches seem to be removed, but that's a minor quibble.

The roster is good, but not great.  Part of the reason is because some of WWE's biggest stars are no longer with the company (Kurt Angle, Steve Austin, Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair).  But the other main reason is that some of these selections just suck.  There's an overabundance of Divas (The Bella Twins?), and a couple unlockable characters are a letdown.  Cowboy Bob Orton comes to mind, as do the ""Green"" and ""Red"" training dummies.  Seriously?  But I want to commend the gamemakers for giving each character a distinctive feel to him/her.  Each wrestler and Diva plays like they probably would on TV.

The controls are very good.  They actually feel simpler than in previous ""WWE SvR"" titles, and I think that's a good thing.  There's only one reversal button, the health bars have been replaced with a tiny meter under the wrestlers' feet, and some of the more complicated moves require fewer button presses (like aerial attacks).  It's a lot less cluttered.  I don't like the camera angles for when you're competing at ringside, but that's about it.

Now, here's my biggest complaint with this game:
If you're unable (or unwilling) to experience the multiplayer features, you're going to be disappointed.  Single player gaming in this WWE series is slowly dying.  Which is a pity, because the best wrestling games tailor to both one-player and multiplayer experiences.  So, what do you get if you're playing solo?

*** ""Road To WrestleMania"" are cinematic storylines that are about 12 weeks long.  You will choose from 7 wrestlers to play through a unique story.  Your choices this year are Mickie James, Shawn Michaels, Edge, Randy Orton, a created wrestler, or a longer one with John Cena & Triple H.  These are fun to play through for one time only.

*** ""Career Mode"" is an old-school type.  You pick a wrestler, win enough matches (and points) to contend for a championship.  You win the title, you pick another belt to go for.  I haven't played much of this mode, because it looked kinda repetitive.  I'll update the review if I find anything noteworthy to add about this.  But my first impression tells me there's not much to it.

*** ""Story Design"" is the big feature for this year.  To me, it's a step in the right direction, but it's flawed.  You see, this mode will let you control up to 55 scenes & 54 matches in order to create your own storyline.  You write the scripts.  You choose the camera angles.  You choose the matches.  You choose the locations.  Now, this sounds fun, but here are the problems:
---1. You won't win anything by using this mode.  It takes a lot of work to put together a good story, and you have to patient & committed.  But when you're done with the story, all you get to do is play it and/or share it.
---2. But the bigger problem I have is I like the unpredictability of playing through storylines.  Going back to 2007's GM Mode, I had an opponent to go against, and I had to worry about whether my matches or wrestlers were entertaining my audience.  But with this new Story Design mode, I know what's going to happen, and when it's going to happen.  The only way to get any kind of satisfaction from this mode is by sharing it with someone, or playing someone else's story.  And if you're playing all alone, this mode is kinda worthless, in my opinion.

In addition to these modes, you can compete for titles in exhibtion mode, change the allies/rivals for all of the wrestlers, and some more nice tweaks that WWE fans love to have.

Bottom line - ""WWE SmackDown vs RAW 2010"" is a very good wrestling game.  It plays very well.  It sounds good.  It looks good.  And it's got enough modes & features to keep people entertained.  But if you're gonna be playing this game alone, and not use the multiplayer, you'd better just rent this one. Multiplayer Heaven, Single-Player Purgatory"
4.0	"The Good : It works fine with 1 or 2 controllers, including wireless ones (where the wireless dongle goes in the plug). The controller input for both wires and wireless is crisp and responsive. Great for PS2 emulators.

The Bad : Doesn't register as an Xinput device (i.e. XBox 360 compatible). That isn't an issue for most emulators, but is for many PC games, where it isn't recognized at all. There is a program called ""Xbox 360ce"" which can make it act like a 360 gamepad for most games.

Note : This wouldn't work at all  without a driver for me, and I had no way to use the included CD. I found it online. Do a search on ""epforum driver for blue triangular playstation"" and read the forum thread. It has the drivers you need, including one to help with vibration support. Works fine but read for specific issue fixes..."
4.0	Etrian Odyssey filled with Persona 3 and 4 cast.  The dungeon crawling is a lot of fun, albeit really really easy.  Hama/Mudo (light/dark instant kill) spells will kill all trash mobs and you have infinite mana.  I'm in the 4th dungeon and I've been able to instant kill every single trash mob in all dungeons before they can attack, with the rare exception of getting in a surprise attack.  The biggest letdown for me was the dialogue.  Some of the stuff they say is quirky and kinda funny, but it gets old after the first dungeon.  I'm still getting tutorial information and I've been playing for nearly 30 hours.  Unlike Persona 3 and 4, the conversation in this game feel forced and lack any real player control.  I ended up mashing b to skip most of  them after the first dungeon or so.  I'm going to beat it because I bought it, but its nowhere near as fun as persona 3 or 4.  I also enjoyed Etrian Odyssey 1 and 4 more (haven't played 2 or 3 yet) and SMT 4 more.  This game isn't bad by any means, but its not up to standard quality for Atlus, MegaTen, or Etrian Odyssey standards. Underwhelming but still OK.
4.0	"Just out of high school and looking for a job I only had a few hundred dollars on my checking account on me.  I went to the computer store to buy some paper to make a resume and while standing in line I saw a kiosk of Gran Turismo for the playstation.  Got out of line... played a few laps with a champion white honda NSX on stage route 5....was blown away how fast and smooth it was..music was great.. nsx was my favorite dream car... got back in line and bought my paper..

went home... couldn't get the game out of my mind and drove right back to buy the game and playstation console with the last of my money hahaha...

Anyway I've owned every Gran Turismo game released and they just keep getting better and better.  I loved Gran Turismo because it had a Japanese feel to it.. Japanese cars, tracks.. music.. driving around in common sports cars that you see on the streets but I couldn't afford.. it was perfect..but they didn't make it total arcade like you were driving around on snes in fzero going bezerk speeds..felt real.

And then 3 came out... 4... 5... and the menu's got heavier... bulkier.. loading got slower.. tracks stayed the same.. super cars came in and that sort of hurt the franchise for me, now it was way over the top and felt bulky without style or life.. no more could I buy a Alcyone Subaru SVX... or Toyota Altezza..(granted they still have my miata in the game..)

Gran Turismo 6 is like a giant DLC of 5.  I'm a huge fan like I said of GT series and they have made the menu WAY easier, and it looks better.. but it's the same stuff as 5..  sometimes I wish they'd come out with a Initial D stage version or something that focuses on the glory sports cars of the 80's and 90's.. throw in some stylish best motoring japan music and I can tell you - people will go nuts for the game..

Ok back on track to my review... it's a good buy if you're a fan of GT series especially if you don't have 6.  Wish they had skipped this and focused on PS4 but.. guess that's for the next release (hence why I gave it 4 out of 5).  And Forza? Xbox?  Only if you insist on a Microsoft console.  And the sound?  Like others have said..it hasn't changed since 3 or 4... not a huge deal to me it's the control and feeling of the game that I'm more interested in.. aggressive AI.. fun factor.. but some of these challenges and super cars turn me off.. again just me and my opinion but if you're looking for something that is an improvement from 5..there's not much. Slight improvement to GT5"
4.0	"I've got both an Xbox 360 and a Nintendo Wii and wanted to give some insight into the differences.

The Xbox is a professional deal, no doubt.  You can do all sorts of things like download movies (HD ones too), games, all sorts of things like that.  The graphics are insane and the games hard core.  So when I got a Wii recently it felt a lot like going back in time to the days when I owned a Nintendo 64.  The sophistication of this thing is that old.  They really put out a no frills model with the Wii.

On the other hand, they got it right.  When my brother and his two kids visited we found ourselves having a blast playing games. My brother worked  up a major sweat doing the boxing.  This is a great family console.  All I've played is the sports games on the demo disk but that's enough of a novelty that I'm satisfied.  The controller is a cool idea, it's not 100% precision but neither are the games.

Recommend getting this.  I had to get one on Ebay for 315 because they were sold out everywhere else. Addictive"
4.0	i am a huge diablo fan, i have to make a freaking new computer to be able to deal with the next one, but that is not what i am talking about today.  2k has once again shown that they do want to keep the video game genre out of the recession.  i mean this game is fun, the characters and the dialogue keep you laughing, the story is no ff7 but it is engaging, and then you add the guns... oh my the guns!!!  i mean as far as fps go i love to snipe, but in this game when you have a shotgun that blows your opponents into itty bitty pieces you just do get bored of that.  or how about a pistol that shocks your opponent to death.  i find the key to the game is giving me the guns because i could not stop looking for the next one i would use.  even splattering the skags in this game is a riot!  it is worth the purchase, and i see they already have download component on the way.  HATS OFF TO 2K... now if only they could get the football license back... diablo for the console
4.0	"The Evil Within is a great game, just some simple things that make it a 4 outta 5.
One thing that I'm not too concerned with is the graphics. Although fairly decent, the graphics are no where near what they could be for a ""next gen"" console. But this doesn't take away from the game very much.
The big con for the game is the linear and sometimes repetitive gameplay. Many scenarios or whole levels feel similar, and basically like your just forced to go about it one way only. This is okay sometimes but I'd like a little something more direction wise. With this sometimes it feels like you have no choice but to die in the game, this came up 2 times during the game where as you run for this one villain he appears right in front of you and one shot kills you. I looked online after trying a few times and many people suffer from same problem, without any solution but to keep trying and hoping the bad guy somehow misses (he did for me on the 4th try).
Overall a really fun game, if you like Resident Evil 4 or 5 you'll love this game, a lot of it feel similar to those games, even some levels/ enemies do. Well worth the money, here's to hoping for a sequal :D Great game, get it if you're a RE4 or RE5 fan!"
4.0	"Let me start by saying you are getting 2 games for the price of 1: Escape from Butcher Bay re-mastered in HD, and a wonderful follow-up Assault on Dark Athena.

Firstly they did an awesome job transferring Butcher Bay over to the Next Gen Console; this game never seems to get old. The mixture of stealth, hand-to-hand takedowns and gun fights are more than entertaining. Also the conversation you engage in to find certain achievements like collecting cigarette packs adds to the replay value.

Secondly getting a sequel on the same disc, Assault on Dark Athena is definitely an added bonus. You can see the graphical difference from Butcher bay, and it held on the exact game play and elements that made the first game so great. You get to engage in the same kind of conversations, kills and takedown moves.

Playing both games back-to-back really makes it feel like one complete game, which stretches out the story over 20 hours or more, but it's hard to calculate because I wasn't counting. The only thing I wish they hadn't added was the multiplayer; unfortunately there really isn't anyone playing this online anymore, and its shame because half of the achievements are multiplayer related.

All and all it's a solid title, and I hope that Vin Diesel delivers us a third title in the series in the near future. Riddick is still the most bad ass character in the galaxy!"
4.0	Shenmue was a great experience.  Even if you're a total lunkhead and can't follow the plotline, there are so many ways to pick up additional clues without leaving the game itself.  The 'practice' system of improvement is stunningly realistic, if a bit boring at times.  I'd love to wait through and see the seasons pass (there was a guy in a Santa Suit on the streets at Christmas).  On the other hand, the game, while great in plot, mechanics and stunning visuals...was painfully short.  I flew through the discs and finished in no time.  There's a lot I missed, of course, but still, it would be nice to have more subquests. Where are discs four and five?
4.0	All good.. Item as described.... Four Stars
4.0	"Fantastic but flawed, Dragon's Dogma offers a rich role-playing experience for those willing to overlook its nagging structure and underwhelming plot-line. Built around a spectacularly fun and interesting combat system, DD pushes the envelope for open-world RPGs with engaging boss battles and a setting rife for exploration. Unfortunately, the game falls prey to a tedious travel system that has you literally running from one corner of the huge game world to another and back again on a regular basis.

I played Morrowind back in the day, and absolutely loved traveling through the fantasy realm on foot, but here, a good decade or so later, the system hasn't aged well. This is only made worse by an unforgiving and clunky save-system that only allows one save-file per game: auto-saves are sparse, particularly in the open world, and quest failures are permanent. On top of that, your AI companions (AKA Pawns) are irritatingly outspoken, shouting about goblins and harpies endlessly while you try to take in serene views of the beautifully rendered land of Gransys. NPCs fare even worse, with abysmal voice-overs, dull visual design, and relentlessly recycled dialogue.

For all its faults, there's a really great game to be found in Dragon's Dogma. As I mentioned before, the game world is vast and diverse, and the combat system is nothing short of wonderful. Boss encounters are excellent, and often revolve around scaling the beasts for effective take-downs ( la Shadow of the Colossus), really adding to the game's immense sense of scale. DD also offers a wide variety of character classes and impressive skills that can be switched up at a whim for a more flexible gameplay experience catered toward your personal style.

Dark Arisen also delivers a terrific bonus for those who invest time and effort into the original campaign: the added setting of Brittleback Island is challenging and rewarding, with plenty of baddies and secrets to conquer as well. It's a great value packaged with in an already amply packed game: players willing to look past the more trying aspects of Dragon's Dogma will find a lot to love here. A rough but ultimately excellent experience worth checking out! Too Much of a Good Thing: A Towering, Tedious, and (still) Terrific RPG"
4.0	I like this game. I played it many times over and I enjoyed it each time. It is fairly easy to complete not like some of the more complex games I tried to play and couldn't handle. Maybe I'm still just at a beginner level in RPGs. It's  pretty  good
4.0	"This was my first fighting game.  I had a few friends teaching me the basics and some more advanced stuff but most of the time I found myself spamming the moves I could pull off easily.

The things I like about the game are the online ranking system, it works well.  I find myself at about 50:50 for win/loss, which in my eyes shows matchmaking is doing a good job at keeping it challenging, yet rewarding.

The main story mode is kind of hit or miss.  I can't bring myself to watch the cheesy cutscenes and movies.  Having to unlock some of the characters can be grueling as well.  Some people just run right through Seth (Cammy, Zangief, Rufus, the French fighting guy, and Sagat).  I was never able to get the hang of the charge characters.  I've used a joystick and controller (with Kontrol Freeks), and I do much better with the controller.  There's not really a good way to learn these moves either because if you don't do them fast enough it doesn't count it as a move anyway.

The graphics are cartoony, but good.  I mean, there really isn't much to program except about 12 maps, 100 moves, and 30 characters, so it should have good graphics.  My friends complain about how much less skill this game takes over SF2 because the moves don't require as much speed and accuracy on the controller.  Where it was my first fighting game, I kinda need all the help I can get.

All in all, it's not my thing, I'm more of a CoD and Forza person, but this game was fun to learn and play around with from time to time. Overall it's pretty good."
4.0	nastalgia Four Stars
4.0	This is a perfect fit, and won't scratch device during application like some do. The plastic has a good weight to it and is not cloudy. It's well constructed so the joints don't pop. It isn't Otterbox protection but for light protection and fingerprints it does the job well. I recommend. Perfect fit
4.0	"It really surprises me when it really comes to video games. They always simply stay easily the same. The games have improved slightly, but not heavily on approval during the years of racing. However, one brand name really has taken into view during the past several years, Need For Speed. Surely, electronic Arts has done a magnificent job making it one of the top racing series games of all time. Yet, they just sometimes surprise me about what kind of a racing game they have lined up for the consoles next time around. Arguably, it also proved to have a good start with the Playstation, and the sequel, the PS2. Arguably, when it hit the skidmarks on the Nintendo Gamecube, you really ddin't know what to rev up.
Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2, is the sequel to the widely acclaimed Need For Speed 3. Arguably, this is a much more deserved sequel than the previous sequel, Need For Speed: High Stakes. That game really wasn't a real beaten path. This game goes well beyond the other ones, as you rev up with a vast amount of courses and cars to choose from. The game features about a dozen different kinds of courses and cars to choose from, once you earn enough points, you can access these tools widely well. The game also includes a really exciting amount of different ways to play. You can play Hot Pursuit mode, which really is a test to see if you really are one step ahead from the cops, regular tournament mode, where whoever scores the highest amount of points with a number of races wins, lap knockout mode, where if you're last within any lap of the race, you're out, and regular single race mode. The graphics on this game are also amazing, and the vast amount of cars to unlock also goes beyond extreme, as you can unlock cars from all over the world, including the Mercedes XTR, Porsche Carerra GT, and many more exoticas to choose from.
There is a downside to this version for the Nintendo Gamecube. Unlike its other counterpart version, Playstation 2 and Xbox, you can't access new cars that easily through codes. Here, you really have to do it the old fashion way in the process by gaining points to welcome the new fleet of races. Still it is well worth the gamble here, where cheats have to be the earned here, not coded up. Arguably, that is a downside to its part, but the courses and the challenges to unlock are well worth that failure Electronic Arts conjured.
This arguably is one of the best racing games ever to come out. Although many people may want to buy the recent, Need For Speed: Underground, they could do so, but this one os truly a must have for all racers alike. This truly is a must have for the Nintendo Gamecube, only if you have the Gamecube, and not the other video game systems. Rev Up The Cops"
4.0	I got the step platform for my Wii balance board for Christmas.  The balance board sits securely on it, but it's easy to remove it, if I want.  I love the height I get and I do feel like I get a better workout.  Sometimes, my feet don't register as well on the platform or the weight measurement changes. Neither problem bothers me much.  I just go on with the workout. Get a better workout
4.0	"Great graphics, atmosphere (Gothic, somewhat-alien/perverse dying world), and storytelling (if you like vague storytelling that you have to dig and research to figure out).

The only real issue with it is that the difficulty reached its climax for me about in the middle of the game (when fighting an NPC hunter), and everything after that, including the last boss and optional boss were so much easier. I was a bit disappointed at that.

I spent about 40 hours with the game and don't regret any of my time with it. Great game"
4.0	"I enjoyed the first Resistance, and this one is a ""bigger, better, and badder"" version. It has a ton more content, the graphics are better, and it has a lot better single player campaign. It is actually very hard, too. If you like first person shooters, and have a PS3, this is definitely a good pick. Resistance 2 - More of the Chimera"
4.0	This game was fun.  The first day I got it, I played it for hours.  It was very entertaining.  I've never seen a game like it.  I love how you have the animals in your village.  The animals are so cute!  The only problem is, it gets boring after awhile because it just repeats itself day after day.  I also HATED what happened when you turned the game off without saving.  It was a very cute game though.  I'd recommend it. Good.
4.0	While 2007 is better than 2006, there's still room for improvment. The game itself playcs very well and it feels very much like a sim, but the learning curve feels a bit steep if you're new to the genre. The graphics are were we could see the most uprade potenital. The grass looks too much like a flat texture with no detail and too little volume and the trees can go from wonderful to terrible on the same course. Repeated tree models placed side by side by side really make the product itself feel cheap. I'm still happy to have it- but not terribly impressed yet. Swing Tiger Tiger Tiger...
4.0	"It may not have been considered the ""it"" shooter when Battlefield 3 was out, but to me it was, and that is when DICE got my attention.  It had been a long time before I had that much fun with a shooter, and my preference shifted from CoD to BF with the last title.

Enter Battlefield 4, and once again, online is fun as hell.  The maps are not just stunning, but very well laid out as well.  For Obliteration mode, I love Siege of Shanghai.  There is enough distance to have several different approaches, but the bomb points make for some great battles when you're either going to set or defend.  The Hainan Resort is an amazing close quarter type map for Team Deathmatch and Domination.  There are so many ways the enemy can come from, you have to keep your head on a swivel.  My personal favorite mode has always been Rush (but Scavenger really stole my heart in BF3, and I hope it comes back in BF4).  For Rush, all of the maps are great with different types of situations on each set of two attack points.

The graphics are just amazing on the PS3, and I cannot wait to see how it will look on the PS4.  Not only does the destruction on the Frostbite 3 engine make things look great.  They actually change the way the game is played as well.  I'm very happy with how the destruction happens on this game.  I can only imagine how it is going to look on the next gen systems.

It's not without it's flaws though.  Especially Battlelog.  Lately I have had trouble with seeing certain friends online when we're playing together.  It will show them as offline, and the only way to join a game with them is by choosing the specific game they're in on the multiplayer friends server list.  While this is a fine workaround, it doesn't always put you in the squad or same team as your friend like joining through the Battlelog does.  Another annoyance that has carried over from BF3 is getting stuck on ledges and rubble that should easily be able to just walk over.  Instead you're stuck, and most times easily leads to getting killed.  Same goes with trying to climb over certain rails and objects.  It's definitely low enough to climb over, but instead you're just jumping up and down like an idiot.

While those two things are annoying, they definitely don't take away from the fun.  While I know there are always bugs, guns too overpowered, etc. at the launch of not just Battlefield, but almost every shooter, I have full confidence that these issues will be handled.  To me, it's already been an amazing experience, and cannot wait to move over to next gen later this week. The ""It"" Shooter by Far"
4.0	I wish the online racing allowed for multiple players to play at the same time and I think the online versions needs to be worked out it's difficult to get into an online race and have it work. that aspect is not as good as the mario kart online racing. other than that the game is a blast I had an great time beating it! good
4.0	So when I first got these and put them on, they worked great, you do have to get used to them as they do make joy sticks more responsive. As I said, they worked great until they started popping off, the only way to keep them on is to glue them, but they do work well after that. Need to glue on
4.0	"Pros:
Completely original story and setting for SRPGs
Fun and unique combat
nice combo of real time and strategy
Every character is unique with plenty of back story

Cons:
Some missions are so hard it's not even fun. I mean I don't want a easy game but one mission is the standard of what they throw at you while learning new things and then next the difficulty is unbearable and there is no way you can win without either reading a guide or trying over and over and over again like in the nintendo days. Original SRPG on the PS3 that one one should skip on"
4.0	the selection of songs are just bizarre. everything from Johnny Cash to screamo music. But its a good title, I guess... Shouda redone the song selection

Before even playing this game, you have to realize that it is entirely different from the rest of the Final Fantasy series that made the name famous.  The story telling, worlds, and characters are similar, but that's where the similarity ends.  It plays much more along the lines of the Legend of Zelda series with a bit more freedom.  This game definitely requires a few hours of play time to ""get"".

The very first thing you notice about this game is how incredibly refined it is.  Every detail from the title screen to the very end is intentional and well thought out.  The load times are almost non existent, which, given the detail and complexity of the world of The Crystal Bearers, is an extremely impressive and appreciated feat.

The graphics are just gorgeous.  They have that classic Final Fantasy level of awesome taken to another level.  You can look anywhere in this game, even in the places where no one would look, and you'll find nothing incomplete or lacking.  That alone adds some well needed pleasure to this game.  The screen shot feature, which allows you to press a button and save a picture of anything going on in the game, is an excellent little addition.  There is hardly a moment in this game when there isn't something amazing on the screen.

The plot is similar to a classic Final Fantasy story.  A unique fantasy world with a problem and some young people out to do something about it.  All of the (surprisingly feminine) characters are unique and fit their roles well.  The story is played out through a large number of (often lengthy) cut-scenes with voice acting.  The voice acting is a mixed bag.  The voice most often heard, Layle, sounds about as enthusiastic as a cow chewing cud.  On the other hand, the voice of Jegran is simply amazing.  The rest fall somewhere in between.

I have very high standards when it comes to video game music and The Crystal Bearer's soundtrack ranks up there with some of the best Final Fantasy games.  The style in The Crystal Bearers is unique (I'm pretty sure they used some bagpipes and a banjo in this soundtrack), yet manages to be distinct, catchy, and memorable.

The actual gameplay is where this game really falls flat on its face.  Layle (the protagonist) is a ""crystal bearer"" and has a force-like power to grab things from a distance and monkey around like Tarzan.  That's it.  In battle, you can't really do much more than grab enemies and objects and throw them around at each other.  Long gone is the classic Final Fantasy complex character development and battle system.  In The Crystal Bearers, there is no magic, no battle party, no experience or levels, no random battles, no weapons or armor, or much of anything that you would come to expect.  The only way to get more powerful is to collect items and combine them into accessories.  Your three accessories completely determine the strength of Layle.  Collecting the items for these accessories is a chore.  Fortunately, you can read newspapers to figure out exactly where to get the items, but actually picking a fight takes ages.  There is a ""day"" and a ""night"" and the monsters only come out at night.  If you happen to arrive during the daytime, you pretty much just have to sit and wait until night for the monsters to come.  There's no Ocarina of Time ""Sun song"" song to change it.  You just have to find something to do like play guitar or review the game for a few minutes until the music changes.

Getting around the world is a nightmare.  You eventually memorize the land and get a few shortcuts here and there, but you still end up spending an enormous amount of time just running from place to place, sometimes completely lost.  This game is in dire need of a mini-map.  It also needs a super-speedy airship-like way to get around at some point in the game like the rest of the series.  I feel like they did some extensive testing on the technical aspects of this game and never stopped to ask, ""Is this game fun?""  I bet 99% of the players would have said that it was actually kind of frustrating.  That said, the game is very simple and easy enough that just about anyone can pick it up and play it.  A quick play through will take about 13 hours, while getting the best equipment and unlocking all of the medals can take 30+ hours.

Overall, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers seems to be a watered down Final Fantasy for the ""typical"" Wii audience (everybody).  It still manages, however, to be a very good game, despite its departure from the norm. Not entirely a Final Fantasy, but definitely worth playing"
4.0	a very very fun game! Four Stars
4.0	The dlc is great Four Stars
4.0	My son purchased this character to add to his core skylander collection. Chop Chop is not the best character by any means but he is a must have for gamers. Good stuff
4.0	I absolutely love this game. It's my second copy of this. I enjoy the RTS aspect and the LOTR setting. Sometimes my game has a habit if freezing a couple of frames when I issue a command. The units also don't do the action sometimes in large battles. Also, when you try to position the units it's a bit clunky and akward. Other than that, it's a hell Lotta fun I can play it and never get bored! yup
4.0	The original Pirates game was so enjoyable I was thrilled to see this upgrade released.  It is quite similar to the original, a light-hearted game that can be enjoyed without micromanagement.  Not extremely technical in nature it is just a easy to play, relaxing and fun game.  As an old-timer I never could quite get the hang of the dance though which pretty much did the game in for me.  I'm sure that its not all that hard for those more proficient in video games.  If you want a detailed thinking simulation this game is not it.  If you want a fun game for some relaxation, is easy to learn but still offers you numerous options this is a good choice.  If only I could master that dance! If I could only dance!
4.0	Very good JtR game. Four Stars
4.0	GOOD for kids Four Stars
4.0	"The racing sim part of rfactor deserves 5 stars, but the single player ""game"" part of rfactor deserves 1 start.  Let me explain.

rfactor really isn't designed for single player mode.  It comes with a few fictional cars that can be raced on a few fictional tracks.  The user is expected to mod the game adding tracks and cars created by other users.  The AI is just plain terrible.  I tweaked the config file a bit and improved it a little.  The AI will ram your car off the track every chance it gets.  It will always try to run the fastest possible line, even if you are in the way.  It will not even realize you are there and just try to drive right through you.  The AI doesn't use normal physics either.  It can stop much faster than the player can and turn much faster.  If you buy this game for single player use, you will be disappointed.

The Sim part of the game is amazing.  Cars drive how you would expect them to.  Graphics are top notch.  You get everything you would expect out of a top notch driving sim.  Its as good or better than anything out there, iracing, gtr2, gtr evo, or whatever you favorite sim is.

Multi-player works like this.  Users design cars and tracks and then host servers.  You need to figure out what tracks and cars you need in order to join the server.  If you don't have the right car, you won't be able to join.  rfactor leaves most of the work up to the users.  I looked online to see if I could find a game but there was only a couple games that had players in them and I didn't have the right tracks and cars so I couldn't join.  I was too lazy to figure out what I needed so I just jumped on iracing instead and ran some races there.

Rfactor has huge potential, but you need to know what your doing.  If you are the type of person who loves racing online, and doesn't mind modding a game yourself, rfactor is for you.  If you are lazy or lack the knowledge to mod a game, rfactor might disappoint you.  If you don't even own an expensive force feedback racing wheel, what are you doing go play need for speed. not a single player sim"
4.0	muy bueno Four Stars
4.0	Don't remember getting this... Four Stars
4.0	"Lucas Arts has come out with some notable fiascos over the past few years as far as games are concerned. Force Commander, X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter (which is only good in multiplayer), StarFighter, etc. This is one of thier outings that I actually would rate at 4 1/2 stars and is one of the most misunderstood and underrated games to come out of George Lucas's computer game brainchild.
  The premise is simple. You are given control of either the Empire under Emperor Palpatine or the Rebel Alliance under Mon Mothma. If you start out as the Imperials you'll get a significant advantage in technology and capital ships as well as more developed worlds...plus you have a bonafide Jedi in Darth Vader, who can detect and train Jedi Students as he discovers them, making these officers even more valuable (more on this later). The Rebels start off with 2nd rate capital ships and planets that are far flung for the most part. Thier base is moveable, and under the circumstances that's a good thing since part of the Imperials' goals is to destroy the Rebel base.
  I'll try to simplify this game, but it's not an easy task. Depending upon the size of the galaxy you have picked (Small, Medium, Huge, etc) your goal is to colonize planets and develop them, use diplomacy to introduce other cultures either into the Rebellion or the Empire, or outright conquer enemy planets. These planets can then be equipped with varying tools to make use of thier inherent commodities...for instance one planet might have multiple Shipyards for building your navy, while others might be resource sytems, used only for mining and maintaining your credit flow. Characters in the game each have inherent uses...some can do Ship Research, others can be used for Diplomacy, while others can be sent to Sabotage enemy worlds and ships. If the Character has been detected to be a Force User, then a Jedi Knight or Master can begin to train them, resulting in a Character with increased scores for thier particular specialty. In addition Characters can be places in positions of Authority, either in Fleets or on Planets. Admiral Ackbar can lead one fleet while Lando Calrissian can General it, thus resulting in your fleets doing more damage and taking less hits in battles.
  Research is a lot of fun and can be begun almost from the beginning, in one of three areas. Ship research (New ship designs, fighters, etc), Building design (New Planetary Shields, Improved Shipyards), and Troop Design (Dark Troopers, Sullastan Regiments). Typically whoever has a leg up in Research has an easier time controlling the game and it's highly recommended that if you find any NPC's (Wedge Antilles can do Ship Research, Bevel Lemelisk can do all three types)to start ASAP.
  The part everyone wants to know about though is the gigantic ship battles, and man they can get epic. There's nothing like seeing 100 Rebel ships do battle with the same number of Imperial ones, and engagements can run up to 30 minutes. The graphics of these battles are a little dated by today's standards, but still seeing a Calamari Cruiser turn sideways to exchange broadsides with a Star Destroyer is a sight to see. Fighters swarm around the whole time sniping at enemy fighters or helping engage the big capital ships. There's different options for your ships to maneuver into position for attacks, but as far as I can see they're for the most part pointless as both fleets typically run straight for the other and begin duking it out.
  Single player is fun, but gets dreary after a while, especially if you're playing as the Rebels. The Imperials generally name thier ships at the beginning, but the database for ship names must be shallow because soon after you'll start seeing such inspiring names as ""Carrack Cruiser 152"" or ""Star Destroyer 43"". And the most glaring deficiency in Single player mode is that the Imperials will *never* build a Death Star. Ever. Leading me to want to shout ""The Death Star plans are not in the main computer""!
  This game becomes sterling in multiplayer though, and if you ever wanted to play a strategy game on an almost epic level, this is definitely a game you want to check out. A human will almost invariably play by different strategies than the computer will, and oftentimes you'll find different and sometimes very unique methods employed for winning. My brother tends to build zillions of fighters on each planet he owns, making capital ship conquest almost impossible to accomplish without matching the number of fighters in your own fleet. My nephew builds heavily into Capital ships with a mixed escort screen, basically heavy on planetary bombardment. I tend to make a mixture of the two aiming for a well rounded task force. And when Turn 5000 hits and you're still grappling for control of the galaxy with your opponent, well let's say that it never wears down on you. If ever you get a chance to build a Death Star, do it. It is an incredible rush to build one secretly, moving it suddenly and unexpectedly into your opponents main manufacturing planets' orbit, and then hitting ""Destroy Planet"", watching half of his shipbuilding capability go up in a blaze of smoke and rubble.
  Unless you have a LAN at home and know someone who wants to try this gem of a game out, the only place you'll be able to play is on Gamespy and Internet Gaming Zone, but expect games to be *very* long and drawn out, sometimes lasting as much as a week, depending upon how often you have to save and reload.
  The mediocrity of the Single player game is more than made up for in Multiplayer. Trust me and grab a copy and see for yourself :) An entertaining SW outing"
4.0	Works great for the price Four Stars
4.0	Its good. It works, seems to be original but does not come with packaging. Its good.
4.0	Let me start by saying that this is a very, very good console controller.  The buttons are sensitive, the joysticks are responsive.  The D-pad is a bit wobbly, but I almost never play games that require, so I can't comment too much on that.  I know some of my friends complain about it a bit, but its never bothered me.  The reason that this only gets four stars is because its clearly the second best option out there.  If you're going to buy a new 360 controller, you really need to buy the wireless one.  I own both and after about six months, I only use the wireless one and this one sits in my drawer until a friend comes over to play.  If wireless makes you nervous for some reason, then feel free to buy this model, but you'll be missing out. A Great Second Choice
4.0	Thank you. Four Stars
4.0	"I already have two oem wii remotes but needed some extras for friends/family that come over to play Mario Kart 8 and Smash. I also needed some new nunchucks as one of my originals was worn out. Since I didn't want to spend the money on the oem products this core pack seemed like a sweet deal and I wouldn't be out much money if things didn't work out. I took the risk and ordered two and overall I am satisfied.

The set works as it should and honestly I can tell no difference in the function of these remotes vs the original. The kama I actually like better than the nunchuck because it is larger and has bigger buttons making it more comfortable to use.

I had no syncing issues on the Wii U but I will admit that my console is set up in my bedroom and I sit 7-8 feet from the tv, so for that range the remotes have no loss of sync problems.

The cons of the product is that the speaker on these remotes are quite bad...I mean they sound fine but sometimes they sound like static is coming through along with the sound. I just lower the volume on the speaker so its not a huge issue. Also I've noticed that it depends on the game how the sound will ""sound""...for example when playing Mario Galaxy 2 the sound of collecting star bits sounds horrible and very screechy, but playing Twilight Princess sounds decent enough.

Another issue I had with one of the remotes is that the B button on that remote is very sensitive for some reason, just touching it registers it as a press. Not a huge problem but still a little annoying.

For the price I can easily recommend this core set because the kama is very good and the remote works well enough and functions just like the original minus a few minor issues like speaker/button sensitivity. Great for the price"

4.0	"In their campaign to push the original NWN1 role-playing template in all kinds of unorthodox directions, this time around Obsidian expands the Aurora engine to host an extraordinary hybrid of Neverwinter Nights 2, Settlers, and Heroes of Might & Magic. That's right. No wonder it failed to get the attention of either NWN2 or the Mask of the Betrayer add-on: Storm of Zehir requires patience and time just to figure your way around the genre-bending weirdness of this package. Then it requires extra patience and time to make enough money by trading (Settlers portion), to reach higher levels by hunting down enough mobs and doing enough local sidequests (Heroes of Might & Magic portion), and to complete the overarching plot and its subquests (NWN2 portion) in order to finish the game. I did take the time and now I take my hat off to Obsidian realizing that they managed to push NWN2's envelope even further than Mask of the Betrayer and get away with it. Such bold and creative experimentation with an RPG engine (and mechanics) is to be commended.

Zehir catches us off guard because most of us approach it as ""just another small scale NWN add-on"". It does start off like that, but soon it blossoms into an epic experience that is only comparable to the most ambitious role playing games of recent times. And even that description fails to do it justice as essentially it's three games rolled in one. Amazing. Let's count the ways:

- Part of the framework here is to go VERY old school. It's an unexpected move since NWN2 and MotB both excelled in being forward-looking and experimental. But Zehir actually far surpasses them as an experiment. It starts off by adopting the wide-eyed, enchanted feeling of typical 1980's RPG's -- which was the best bit about them -- without falling into their traps of repetitiveness and eventual boredom.

- This time, it's truly open ended, a game of the ignore-the-main-quest-and-explore-the-country variety which is vastly different from previous NWN games. It's a small miracle that the Aurora engine could pull this off.

- Obsidian serves us their own version of Heroes of M&M seemingly without even trying. Because it's all based on the pre-existing NWN character, prestige and leveling system, which is one of the most complex and better-implemented CRPG systems ever, the game ends up as something that's arguably more intriguing and deeper than the actual Heroes of M&M.

- The trading system is not tacked on but forms an organic part of the whole. The game even manages to make this open-ended trading between towns a plot development device that makes the role-playing portion roll forward.

- Even if the focus is not on in-depth characterizations this time, the game does not sacrifice lengthy, colorful dialogues as a lesser game would. The result is almost overwhelming, in a good way: the characters are alive, and the trading system is alive, and the sidequests are alive.

- For once, the light, cheerful approach and the sunny tropical setting are refreshing, especially if you come to Zehir directly after completing the dark and oppressive MotB. There are even some odd characters like Volo who seem to be included mostly for comic relief.

- The engine's graphical aspects seem to be upgraded. All aspects of Zehir's graphics are pretty, even in 2012. The dimly lit tropical caves are some of the most beautiful ones I've seen in a game.

- The overland travel system is typical 80's stuff, well implemented. It surely is more interesting than the static region maps that most contemporary RPG's use for long distance travel.

Yes, there are trade-offs. The plot IS thinner than in any previous Obsidian games, and far less interesting than MotB's storyline. The random mob encounters every 2 minutes ARE frustrating and draining, but they are a necessary evil needed to propel the open-ended mechanics forward (by giving plenty of XP). Towns ARE tiny and forgettable this time, because the game scheme needs many of them. Our optional cohorts are NOT very interesting this time, lacking elaborate background stories, but there's a good selection of them. To sum up, it's often quantity over quality with Zehir. This is the first Obsidian game to feature some unsavory elements from the hack-n-slash genre, which is almost the equivalent of a Steven Spielberg stooping to direct a porn film.

The limited, mediocre Aurora engine creaks and suffers under the daunting task of having to support this hybrid monster. Even with the final patch I've encountered a nasty show-stopping bug that required me to edit my savegame so I could progress. Come on, Obsidian!..

It all sounds worse than it actually is. Zehir does deserve that you give it a try.

It's great that Obsidian had the guts to create this complex experiment. It must have taken a visionary just to put the blueprints of Storm of Zehir on paper, let alone to successfully implement it as an unassuming NWN2 expansion pack. If there ever was a game that is more than the sum of its parts, this is the one. I'd LOVE to see a Neverwinter Nights 3 that stems from the crazy, genre-unifying Zehir experience. Just don't let Bioware do it: Obsidian must be the one. Obsidian's nostalgia trip is a visionary experiment"
4.0	"I found this little guy at a midnight sale for really cheap. Kind of reminded me of the first Ghost Recon (use of stealth is ideal). I think the most interesting aspect of this game is the background of the Navy Seals and how you get to be the guy that started the regime. Pretty straightforward: go in there, take care of business, don't get caught, and get out. Similar gameplay of any traditional first-person shooter, except a lot of swearing. But, who doesn't like throwing someone off a balcony while saying a few cuss words?

Recommendation: If you find it for about the price of eating a value meal, it's worth it. Pretty Good For a Cheap Game"

4.0	"Introduction:

If you read my other reviews, you'll know I'm actually a huge Sonic fan.  I'm also a little bit of a Mario fan (although the characters there seem significantly stranger).  So, being a fan of both, it makes sense to look forward to and get a hold of this game.  I got it for Christmas, and I have to say, I'm nowhere near disappointed!  You might want to know, however, that there is no option for left handed people; so it might be harder for those who are left handed.  I played this game hard over the holidays, and I've unlocked a lot of cool stuff; so, here's the inside scoop.

Features:

Basically, this game came out in celebration of the Beijing (hopefully, I spelled that right) Olympics.  It has at least most of the classic sports: track (many versions, including hurdles), swimming, table tennis, trampoline, high jump, long jump, triple jump, hammer throw, javelin, pole vault, single skulls (a rowing competition), springboard, fencing, skeet (a shooting competition.  Don't worry, nothing alive; just clay discs), Archery (again, just targets), and even a sky diving competition (I'm not sure if that one is traditional)!  You can play as sixteen characters (eight Sonic and eight Mario) classified into four groups as follows:

Power type: Knuckles, Bowser, Vector, and Wario.

All around type: Mario, Amy, Luigi, and Blaze.

Speed type: Sonic, Daisy, Shadow, and Yoshi.

Skill type: Peach, Tails, Waluigi, and Dr. Eggman.

This selection is only the in game characters, as you can also select a Mii you've created.  A Mii's type isn't explained, but play as him/her a while to figure it out (I think mine is a speed type).

The Menu:

Single Match Mode:  Play with one to four players in one event at a time.  the specified fields are Athletics, Shooting, Gymnastics, Dream Events, Rowing, Aquatics, and Fencing.  A couple of events need teams of four; if you are playing alone, you can choose how many you can control, or be COMs (Computer controlled).  Please note that some events need to be unlocked; like the Dream Events.  You can unlock events by getting gold medals, the easiest way being to find sports you're good at and win with all of the characters (that's sixteen medals per sport).  The Dream Events are fun, and include: Dream Race, Dream Fencing, Dream Table Tennis, and Dream Platform (the skydiving one).  You'll want to unlock these events, as Dream versions of Fencing and Table Tennis, is a lot more fun than the original versions.

Circuit Mode: Earn trophies by competing in three to six events in a row for overall first place.  You have to win gold medals in Single Match Mode to unlock the circuits.  I've only beaten the Beginner ciruits.

Mission Mode: Play various missions as the characters.  These missions can be anything from placing in a certain place, beating a rival, or scoring a certain amount of points.  I'm almost certain you earn something if you complete all of one character's missions (completed missions are shown with yellow stars); but I haven't been able to do this yet.  Also, note that some missions require you to be in events you need to unlock in Single Match Mode.

Gallery: A great place to take a break from the major olympic games.  Play the simple mini games: Voice Memory, Card games (like matching and memory), Whack a mole, Count Master, and Bound Ball.  If you accomplish getting a certain score in these games, you'll learn very interesting things about the Olympics like: how to participate, who Beijings mascots are and what they stand for, Olympic history, and more!  Did you know they didn't always give gold medals to the Olympic winners?  How about that one person won track bare footed?  Unlock all of the information in a section to get cool museum background music from the Sonic and Mario games.  This is easily the most educational place in the game.

Collection Mode: View medals, trophies, emblems and world records.  Good if you don't quite remember what you already won.

Options: Configure a couple of things.  I don't remember what 'cause I hardly ever go there.  For left handed people, I'm sorry to say you can't access a configuration for left handed control, even here.  I'm right handed, so this isn't a problem for me; but I understand how it can be a problem.

Other interesting things: If you're a fan of Mario and/or Sonic, knowing these little details may make the game further appeal to you.  Even if you're new to both, these things may still interest you.

1.  Heavy Sonic fans will know that Sonic can't swim.  So, in every event that deals with water (Swimming, Rowing, and even Dream Platform), he wears a life jacket.  This is kind of funny and cute.

2.  Although the sixteen characters I mentioned are the only Sonic/Mario characters that are playable, others make appearances.  Espio, Charmy, Shy Guy, and Lakitu all take part in events like Javelin to calculate things like how far you threw.  They also follow you around in events like swimming (look at the background on the pool's side).  Cream the Rabbit also fires a starting gun in events like track.

3.  The audience is interesting.  One time, I took a glance behind a character who had already performed, and I noticed the only people watching what I do are Toads and Chao.  For those not acquainted, Toads are characters from the Mario series; they're characterized by their mushroom-like hats and simple apparel.  Chao are from the Sonic series; they're the cute blue bubbly things, with the small yellow balls floating over their heads.

Conclusion: So there you have it; the inside scoop.  Some other comments before I close: If you want a good workout, then participate in a lot of aquatics; it's exhausting.  Don't play Voice Memory too much, unless you enjoy being annoyed.  You're not going to pick up on every event right away, so just keep practicing.  Always go for the gold!

4.0	I just picked up my copy today--I know it's a port from the PS2, but so far I've played through 2 1/2 hours without even knowing it. And that's a GOOD thing in my book. The VR missions in sneaking and weapons handling are very important, especially since I haven't played MSG2 before. And since I've  played the Splinter Cell version, I can say that these are two different games--SC relies much more on real, practical sleath using shadows and darkness for your cover, the extra moves of Sam Fisher, etc. still there's room for both. a real treat so far
4.0	"Really nothing I can say that everyone else hasn't said to praise it.  Have been using this keyboard for a few months now with no issues so far.  It is smooth to the type, gorgeous to the sight, and constructed to last.  I do not play any MMORPG games, so I don't miss the extra keys that are available from the K90/95 keyboard.  I use my own wrist pad, but the one that came with the keyboard seems to be built with quality.  The volume rocker bar is what sealed the deal for me, that's exactly what I wanted on a keyboard.  When I play games or watch shows and suddenly it gets loud with a ""BANG"" for any reason, I can immediately swivel that volume down a bit.  The backlit light is adjustable to perfect levels to what you would like to see.  Extra USB port is used for my G700 wireless gaming mouse, works very well.  The corners of the keyboard are a bit sharp, not sure why they could not have rounded it out a bit to be a little safer.  It's okay though, it can scratch an itch if you have one... look at the positive side, right?  The extra key nubs that came with the keyboard (AWSD, 123456) are okay but I put back the original after a while.  The number keys do not have the special characters etched on there.  It's great for gaming I guess, visually, but I do not ONLY game... and I do not remember those special characters off the top of my head all the time.  One cool thing about those key nubs, it super easy to remove with the tool it came with.  Over all, I love this keyboard.  It gives you satisfaction EVERY SINGLE TIME you press down a button.  The cord is thick so you know it will take a beating and it takes up two USB ports on the computer system, but you can count it as one since the keyboard has a built-in USB port you can use.  Highly recommended.

Edit:  One star removed from a ""I LOVE IT"" rating.  As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, LED lights for this keyboard fails too quickly.  After three months usage, a bunch of LED lights went out in three months for this keyboard.
6,8, F9, T, I, }, K, X, right SHIFT key, left WINDOWS key, Up and Down arrow keys, key pad numbers: 9 and 5.

Set up RMA and awaiting for replacement. I still like the keyboard, but this just does not sit well for an expensive keyboard. Excellent keyboard (edit: LED lights fail too quickly)"
4.0	"First off this game is incredibly inventive and amazingly fun when it works. You start off as a child being taunted by some other children. You fight back and in turn impress a few brown minions who then start to follow you. Once you get through this tutorial and actually become the adult overlord you go on a quest to defeat the Empire. One thing you should know is that you're basically pretty weak as a character even when you upgrade fully. The whole key to this game is to use your minions to fight for you. They can do things you can't, like going into certain areas, moving things, and a few other specialized skills.

The game does an excellent job of being amusing, and ramping up the difficulty at a good rate. You want to try to keep your minions around because the more you level them up the more armor they're able to find in the harder they become to kill. If you do lose a minion you can go down to your evil tower and resurrect them, for a price. You also get to pick up three mistresses along the way and if you play your cards right decorating the castle you can even have a four-way with them.

So with all this great stuff, this being one of the best games I've played in a long time, why do I have to give it a four and not a five? It's because the glitches in this game render it nearly unplayable in a couple places. One of the things you have to do is to sweep your mouse with both buttons held down to control your minions so they'll run to certain locations or perform certain actions. Sometimes this is not a big deal, but other times they refused to do what you're telling them to do, sometimes gets stuck moving and won't stop, and all the while your camera can spin out of control so you can barely see what's happening. This seems to get worse and worse the more minions you haven and by the end of the game my wife was wondering why she could hear so many swear words coming out of our computer room. It was incredibly frustrating losing my valuable minions that I had to pay to resurrect to nothing more than stupid stupid stupid AI errors.

The enemy AI is another issue I had with this game. There are some interesting, I guess you'd call them physics, when multiple soldiers are in formation. They get a high defense bonus and it's much harder to take them on. If you have wolves available to you can use the Brown minions to sweep through them and break formation, or sometimes the Reds can on fire, but much of the time they just banned their and wait for you to pick the best way to take them out. I thought it was just happen in the very beginning is sort of tutorial, but even toward the end they just stood there and took whatever I wanted to send at them. I don't know, it just sapped a bit of the fun for me that they didn't attack more actively.

This could seriously be one of the most awesome games I've ever played, if it weren't for the horrible controls, many glitches, suicidal minions, and lackluster AI. By the end of the game I was just trying to leave my guys behind to do as much as I could on my own because they're just so frustrating I couldn't take it anymore.

However, even with all its faults, it's still one of the best games I have bought in years.

--Update--
I just finished the game. The last level and end boss were so much fun! Just a tip, focus on your armor instead of your weapon...you're not really going to need it. Also, finally a good use for the Greens. They even worked better than the Reds. The little assassins tear the last boss stage a new one! Great Game But A Few Issues"
4.0	there's nothing better than holding what feels like a glock in your hand. this has a good weight, the trigger is spring loaded. i have the black wii remote and noticed that its a little rough on the sides of the remote when inserting and removing it. it leaves scratch marks on the sides of the wii remote. i've decided that im going to buy a third wii remote and just keep it in there. Seems to be alright, fits the wii remote alittle tight.
4.0	Received from Eforcity.  The charger works great and the batteries are long lasting.  It comes with little to no directions.  I do warn you that you should charge batteries for at least a day before use to ensure long life.  There is a power switch in the back you have to flip on for the batteries to start charging.  It comes with four batteries.  Wii remotes are not included.  It charges two wii remotes in front and two batteries in the back so you can easily switch out when your battery is low.  It is red when charging and blue when charged.  It plugs in to your wii.  It plugs in to the same place you plug in your power supply.  Then you just plug in your power supply on top of that.  My 4 star rating is for great product but no direction. Love it
4.0	"Now that the prices on the secondary market have dropped to near retail price the systems are getting returned in record numbers and not just by the resellers, many are being returned by people who fell for the hype and realized that there is just not enough you can do with it right now.

There are really only a couple of games worth playing on the system right now, and really only one of those is PS3 specific, Resistance:Fall of Man.  The Blu-Ray is nice but you might want to see how the battle shapes up in Blu-Ray VS. HD-DVD battle before you commit to the Blu-Ray format.  This could be the Betamax vs VHS all over again and I would hate to think that in a couple of years time the Blu-Ray is dead and there fewer movies released in the Blu-Ray than HD-DVD.  But by that time the price will have dropped and will be great gaming system even if Blu-Ray loses to HD-DVD.

If you do not plan to connect online with the system then I would recommend the 20GB system and you can purchase memory cards if needed. The abilty to use memory cards is still nice and many people with the 60GB system will be using them to.  Very convenient to take a game save, on a memory card, over to a friends house.  The 60GB is a must if you plan to connect online because there are plans for downloadable content, including games and additions to released games and the 20GB would fill up to fast, probably with one download.  But to be honest the 60GB system is not going to be enough if you plan to download content frequently. I suspect you may even see a larger hard drive PS3 down the road, like a 200GB version, especially if the dowloadable content offered by Sony is a big success.

There is no reason to pay more than retail anymore.  Considering there were about a fifth of the PS3s available compared to the WII, the PS3 secondary market prices are virtually the same and the WII retails for half of the PS3! PS3s are getting returned in record numbers.  If you go to any of the mainstream retailers there is a good chance you will find a system or two waiting for you.  Just stand around the service/returns counter and there is a very good chance you will see one returned right in front of you and many times they are still sealed because they are being returned by resellers.  If you can I would wait a few months to buy one even if you find it at retail because there just is not enough to do with it right now(unless you've fallen hook line and sinker for Blu-Ray movies because the price is similar to a Blu-Ray player by itself).  By this summer the games lineup should double and there will probably be a couple that make the purchase worth while.

The PS3 is still a recommended purchase but don't pay more than retail.  Buy it as a Blu-Ray player now and second as a game console.  Eventually the PS3 will be worth the purchase as a game console no matter how the Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD battle turns out. Getting returned in record numbers, don't pay more than retail!"
4.0	I really like this charging station because it does not take up a lot of room and it charges two remotes at one time. Cool Charging Station
4.0	"Despite an utterly broken launch from 343 Studios, and massive let-downs yet still in regards to the multiplayer capabilities of this collection of the Halo installments, this game still deserves some amount of praise for it's accomplishments, and reprimands for it's shortcomings and failures.

The Master Chief collection was a great idea, and as far as the campaign aspect, and keeping the story alive and well, this collection did a great job.  All of the campaigns have been remastered for the newer generation of hardware, and it shows.  It's even more entertaining that the developers took the time to add in a feature that allows you to press the back button of the controller at any time in the remastered games to change the graphics between the remaster and the original.  343 Studios did a bang-up job with the remasters for all the games, and stayed very true to the originals throughout, with absolutely no story changes whatsoever.  Having the iconic main installments to this franchise all on one disk is a very powerful thing.  The cohesion that 343 was able to achieve between the games in the collection was very well done and obviously had some thought behind it's execution.  The campaigns are all enjoyable in their remastered and original glory, and still thoroughly enjoyable.

This collection, does however, only include some of the Halo games, and not all of them.  It includes, as expected, only the ones where the protagonist is Master Chief.  This means you will find Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo 4 in this collection, but you will not find Halo 3: ODST, Halo Reach, or the RTS Halo spin-off, Halo Wars.  I really would have liked to have seen Halo 3: ODST and Halo Reach included in this collection, but I completely understand why they were not included, and nothing was docked for that, just a preference thing, as I really enjoyed Halo Reach.

The reason I docked a star is for the multiplayer that 343 decided to implement within the collection.  It is still yet broken and has many bugs and issues, even this long after launch.  I personally, don't attempt to play much of the multiplayer, and really just wanted the collection for the single player stories, but the fact that a section of the game is utterly broken and was even worse at launch leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth and hole in my trust for 343 Studios capabilities in the future for the Halo franchise.

In short, if you want to relive the glory days of the Halo franchise, in remastered graphics glory, this is the place to do it, and have them all in one place together to experience one after the other, is a great thing.  But if you're looking to play the multiplayer of the collection, be aware that is is severely crippled and has a lot of issues, many of which make it not worth the time to try and play. Amazing Collection of Stories from the Halo Universe, Do Not Buy for Multiplayer Experience"
4.0	"The Hitman series fits in its own place on the third-person action game spectrum. On one side you have stealth games like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid, while the other is filled with stuff like Resident Evil 4 and typical third-person shooters. Hitman is everywhere and nowhere in particular, because the flexibility of its gameplay caters to fans of either side of the spectrum. Hitman: Blood Money has this flexibility and a few other elements that make it a viable purchase for Xbox 360 owners and Hitman fans on other consoles. In Hitman: Blood Money, Agent 47's story is played totally through flashbacks and recollections of a mysterious, scarred-faced man who claims to have hunted down and killed the elusive agent. I didn't think that the overall story was as particularly gripping as the individual scenarios found in each level. Hitman: Blood Money invites some of the emotion and some of the tension that perhaps a real assassin might feel: is killing another person easy to do for the sake of money? It's possible that some might feel remorse for 47's victims. Each of the twelve levels is a cleverly conceived romp that Io Interactive should be extremely proud of. From the initial training mission, where you'll kill an amusement park tycoon, to one where you'll cleverly kill an actor as he practices an opera on-stage, each level is exciting. When the player completes the level the way it was intended--with stealth--the clever side comes out, and the feeling of accomplishment is immense. Fortunately, setting up the ""accidents"" in each mission is simple enough thanks to an intuitive control system that is mapped entirely to the Xbox 360's face buttons and shoulder triggers. Pressing the A button (or, for PS2 owners, X) will allow you to interact with just about anything in the environment. You can climb up ladders, through open windows, rig explosives, and more. The B button (PS2's circle) allows you to pick up things scattered around the environment, like weapons and disguises. Last, the Y button (PS2's triangle) lets you drop things. Shooting, using weapons, and setting traps can all be done by pulling the Right Trigger, while the Left Trigger allows you to sneak around silently. And though the default perspective is in third-person, there is a first-person perspective available as well, which can be adjusted on-the-fly. I found myself using this first-person perspective in situations where I didn't have to worry about sneaking or following someone, as it gave me a better perspective on different things scattered around the environment. It also felt a lot more natural when the time came to defend myself with a firearm. Since Hitman: Blood Money isn't a game that focuses on combat it isn't the most polished in that area. It feels stiff and sluggish to engage in a firefight, which is unfortunate when Eidos's other recent published release, Tomb Raider: Legends, feels so fluid. At least firefights aren't necessary, or encouraged, because the true fun in Hitman lies where guns aren't used and cunning is the key to success. Using sedative syringes to silently incapacitate your victims is pleasing, but it's all the better when you inject poison into a drink and watch your target drink his life away. It's endlessly entertaining to watch the rich wife in the suburbs explode into flames when she turns on a rigged barbeque grill, then falling into the clear blue water of a swimming pool just after being burned to a toast. And setting traps is great: one of the targets in the opera level can be killed by a falling chandelier if you set a mine in the proper location and time the detonation correctly. Performing these violent killings has a negative effect on 47. This time around, a system called ""Notoriety"" will be affected by how violently or with what level of terror that you execute your hits. If you enter a level in the game and unload on every living thing, you'll earn a lot of notoriety and later missions will be made even more difficult from the beginning, based on your predetermined notoriety. However, performing missions the way they're meant to be-stealthily-you'll gain far less notoriety and have to spend less of your hard-earned money lowering the wanted level. So while it's safe to say that Hitman: Blood Money is accessible to those with an itchy trigger finger, those patient gamers will be rewarded with more available funds to upgrade the in-game weapons and add items to the assassin's inventory. Visually, Hitman: Blood Money is a mixed bag. While the indoor environments are fantastic (the first level, for example, is beautiful), outdoor areas (the rehab facility, for example) aren't always as impressive. Shrubbery and trees are particularly ugly.  I will say, though, that the game has beautiful water effects and decent cloth effects. For example, running between hanging sheets in a suburban home definitely reminds me of Splinter Cell. Last of all, it's definitely got the most humorous ragdoll physics I've seen in ages. When the going gets rough and you're armed with a shotgun, pumping NPCs full of lead, you'll definitely be laughing as bodies slump across the floor and fly over tables. In terms of music, Hitman: Blood Money delivers at just the right time, but it's more about ambience than anything. The opera level was the most captivating, mostly because of the opera music in the background. For once I found myself trapped in ambient noise and speech bytes rather than my Xbox 360 custom soundtrack, and I'd say that Hitman: Blood Money gets the job done in the audio department. The flawed parts of Hitman: Blood Money lie in the A.I, which is sub-par to say the least. NPC's will follow their computerized routes, rarely straying away from them to interact with you or the environment. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because the combat A.I. is quite simply the dumbest thing you'll ever see. I witnessed attackers stand blankly in doorways, unsure of what to do. Other times, I'd randomly alert a guard or stumble into something and frighten a civilian. It's annoying, but it's something that is tolerable to the point that the game itself isn't tainted. Others might say that Hitman: Blood Money's scenarios are dangerously similar to those of other Hitman games, but they're fun and entertaining nonetheless. I particularly liked the rehab facility, suburb, and opera missions, which is why I keep bringing them up: they're tense, they require perfection, and they're obviously entertaining. They're early levels, and the later ones are much more complex, but they're definitely worthy mentions. Overall, this is a fantastic game. Playing through each assignment and figuring out the perfect formula is the key, as well as keeping a low notoriety level. Doing these things will make the experience so much better. Hitman: Blood Money's intuitive controls, satisfying gameplay, and addictive qualities make all of that something that I wanted to do. Even when I'd alert a guard and restart an entire level or miss a chance to kill my target, I was having fun trying to cleverly clear this game. Unskilled players that play on easier difficulties will find that the game is a lot shorter; the later levels are only unlocked on the two harder difficulty settings. Going through different difficulty settings and trying to unlock more missions is the extent of this game's longevity, since there's not a single multiplayer mode in sight, but it's safe to say that you'll want to perform missions at least twice to see just how many different ways each one of them can be finished. Though there are a few flaws, this is a great entry to the series and a nice addition to any gamer's library. Find this Hitman and bring him home"
4.0	This game is pretty fun, but I prefer the Wii version. Four Stars
4.0	Not the best of the series, but a seriously good game. Did not regret a thing. Absolutely worth it
4.0	Tough and complicated Four Stars
4.0	Good update but only worth the current price if you have PS4 Plus or Xbox Gold - so much of the game content is premium. If you don't have premium wait until the price drops to under $30. Good, but....
4.0	Ehhhhhh Far Cry 4 is alright. Endless possibilities of stuff to do, similar like the last one. My main complaint about this game is the motion sickness it causes. The Far Cry series are the only games that I have ever came across that cause me to get sick. I use MotionEaze before I play, making it perfectly manageable. I admit that I get tired of this game very easily... I've currently been much more hooked on Dragon Age: Inquisition and a replay of GTA5 (mixed in with some Destiny multiplayer). As far as I can see the story is a little bit weaker than Far Cry 3. Even though its repetitive this is still a wonderful FPS placed in a beautiful world full of interesting characters and intimidating villains. Solid 4/5 Warning: May Cause Motion Sickness
4.0	Good addition to main game with go terrafin madness. Four Stars
4.0	This game is easier for younger children than the WII version.  My grandson was able to unlock trucks and play immediately. Monster Jam
4.0	"I bought this through Best Buy directly but wanted to leave a review after a few days of getting used to it. I started off on a Razer Deathstalker which is a silicon based keyboard. Been wanting to switch to a mechanical for years now - the price point has just put me off. I was really sold on the Corsair Strafe (RGB) but as I recently received a Razer Kraken Chroma for my birthday I decided the best option would be to keep everything in the Razer family.

I am super happy with my purchase (outside of the price point). I paid $183 after tax for mine at Best Buy.

Switching from a Silicon based keyboard to this has been a bit of a learning curve for my fingers. As the keys are more defined on the mechanical and not flat as they were on the deathstalker I often find myself fumbling around, as I had gotten lazy and would barely move my hands to touch certain keys (I was able to just glide across the surface of the flat keys on the Deathstalker).

Because I'm not used to a resistance on the keys, it has been a bit tiresome to type for longer periods of time. But overall, this was the right move for me.

PS - Overwatch is amazing with this keyboard. When you switch heroes it switches to the color of the hero on your keyboard! Great keyboard, a bit overpriced. Has awesome features for Overwatch!"
4.0	"It has both the first AND second game on the same disc, so you're basically getting two games for the price of one.
I was frustrated since it doesn't recognize save data from the original unless it's clear data that isn't touched, but that's just me.

It's a bit repetitive, but if you're a JRPG fan looking to get this- that should not deter you. You can create your own waifu!"
4.0	cool Four Stars
4.0	I have an issue with the taller grips coming off the stick every now and then but they are easy to put back on. ... the stick every now and then but they are easy to put back on
4.0	Good game and pretty entertaining. I like the different outcomes good
4.0	"Halo is a classic in the gaming industry.  Like Gone With the Wind is to movies.  Classics, whatever they may be, are basically essential goods that have influenced their respective realms and have achieved iconic status.  But the problem with classics is that despite the acclaim and general reverence they eventually show their age, pretty badily too.

Take Gone With the Wind again: The acting is relatively bad in most parts and compared to modern day it's almost pathetic.  Halo, which is one of my all-time favorite series, has a similar problem.  Graphically, it's gotten a MAJOR overall (it's not the extra pixels that most HD collections get, ie. Ico & Shadows of the Colossus - it's completely redesigned) thanks to 343 Industries, and it's definitely cool to switch to what the game originally looked like (if not to see how far we've come graphically in a decade but also for nostalgic reasons), but the game play is archaic (at least to me...) in comparison to the fluidity of the modern day.  That said, the graphics are great, but nothing close to, say, the recently released Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception - 343 definitely impresses with their prowess in this department, but it doesn't jump off the screen and amazes you (overall, I found the graphics pleasant, but perhaps expected more from all I saw and heard about in trailers); still, it's by far the best HD reworking of any dated game to date and 343 deserves a pat on the back.

Halo Anniversary is a great title to pick up for many reasons.  The new graphics are amazing, as is the ability to go from the original to the flashy new skin.  I encountered a few glitchy spots, and the character faces are almost unrecognizable in their new form, but the pros far, far, FAR outweigh the cons.  Halo: Combat Evolved was never my favorite Halo game (Halo 2 warrants that due to its great story line, excluding the cliffhanger ending), but Microsoft gives us a true Christmas treat here. A classic is reborn in HD"
4.0	This game is the greatest RTS game in history! If you are some eleven old who likes Endwar or Halo,this the game for you! The campain is really fun but it will get boring but, there is a mode you can do missions that you can create and choosing the location you want it to be and let the battle begin! That mode keeps me on my xbox360 from morning to midnight and it is still fun! You can also do multiplayer on a campain. This is not really for 8 year olds because of the violense and blood. Military dads can also have a blast! Ask my dad! I am Tommy Dreher And send this message to any bored boy who is desperate to have a war game! To cool for school!
4.0	It works as advertised. Good for lazy people who don't want to do any work at all to transfer data and/or for those who do this often for whatever reason. I was in an unreasonably lazy mood when I ordered this. My advice to others though would be to just use your flash drive and spend an extra 5 minutes to save yourself $17 -- that's like 17 double-cheeseburgers! Does job well, but could just use your flash drive
4.0	"Great for PS2 Online and great for the Hard Drive Connection, many uses for this Adapter.
PlayStation for The Win ! Excellent"
4.0	This game is a hit with my daughter and her friends (tweens).  Seems that the more players the more fun they have.  Overall good game that parents don't need to be concerned about the content that is whithin. Good Family Fun
4.0	so far so good. ive only snagged on it once but it was more of my doing than anything Four Stars
4.0	I payed not very much for this used and it came brand new in box. It has been fun, but the game is a bit slow and lacking in some areas. However graphics are superb and it is interesting. Perfect for a boat/ship enthusiast. Basic simulator, but good quality and value.
4.0	Title says it mostly. They're coming out with a new version of this game soon to fit it with modern graphics, less bugs, and some new content. I would wait for that version to be released if you're interested in playing this game, unless you want the older version for nostalgia, then by all means. Great game for its time
4.0	The PS button on the card allows you to switch between two separate 8MB chips. This is incredibly useful for Kingdom hearts II, which reads cards with a value above 8MB as negative and bars you from playing. Differs from the third-party cards
4.0	Minor games and major fun! Wii play is probably the runner up to wii sports and sports resort. Please give it a BUY :-) Tmac
4.0	I own an Xbox and have owned every system since atari and this is certainly one of the best.  For anybody who already has a dvd player this is the system for you.  It is compact and has great graphic capabilities.  My Xbox is in the garage now due to the fact this one fits better and I have a dvd player on my home theater system.  The only system with Resident Evil Zero and RE4 is coming out.  Also with Games like Mario Cart double dash and Star Wars Rogue leader 3 exclusively coming out on the cube...NOW is the time to buy it at a great low price!!!! WOW!!! what a deal!!!
4.0	Driver 2 is a good game. First of all, the idea of getting out of your car and stealing another is great. Also, the levels are huge. The graphics are ok, but nothing really special. During movie sequences, though,  the graphics are good. Don't get fooled by it saying multiplayer, its not great. You can't get out of your car, there are no civilians and you can only play half of a level. But, in the end Driver 2 is a good game and I recommend it to anyone. Not bad
4.0	"I'm a huge fan of the Borderlands universe, the second one in particular has consumed around 160 hours of my life according to steam.  When i realized it was going to be ported to the vita i was very excited, but after reading the reviews i was feeling cautious and leary of this version.  Well i decided to just take the plung and drop 40 bucks on it and overall im glad i did.  Most of the reviews on amazon are fairly spot on.  You can't go into this expecting the exact same experience you may have had playing it on pc or the consoles.  There are some differences i noticed right off the bat.  The graphics have been slightly downgraded but they still look amazing on the vita's screen.  Yes there are some performance issues when the battles start to heat up and in areas like Captain Flynt's ship that are just generally kind of busy.  Sometimes there is no drop in frame rate and other times it starts to chug.  It's still playable even when the framerate is lower.  I'm just amazed they were even able to port this game to a portable system, it blows my mind!  Bodies no longer stay around when you kill someone, it just creates a satisfying bloody explosion.  Some players have complained about the controls,  accidentally hitting the rear touch sensor and activating the melee attack.  I use a handle grip which makes the vita feel like a controller so i didn't have the same problems as others.  They have mapped the melee attack to the right rear sensor and the run command is on the left rear touch.  The grenades are thrown with the forward right touch and the special ability is the forward left touch.  You are able to remap everything and adjust the sensitivity on the aiming so that's a nice feature.  Overall i like the controls myself.  You don't get ALL of the DLC available but you do get a good portion of it, it's like they meet you half way with the DLC.  I've really enjoyed being able to sit back and comfortably play borderlands on the couch, recliner, or the bedroom, it's pretty sweet.  I've read that the new patches have helped optimize the framerate drops but i didn't purchase this until those patches had already been released so i don't know how much they have helped.  There are times when i wish it ran a little better but im kind of on that ""Better than nothing"" spectrum of the argument.  I mean, it's Borderlands 2.....and it's portable.  You decide. Borderlands 2 Portable.....You decide!"
4.0	"Samurai Warriors Chronicles is Tecmo Koei's newest hack-and-slash adventure, for the new Nintendo 3DS. Like any one of the Warriors titles, it involves killing lots and lots of enemies. Does it stand up to its name, or is it another boring Warriors adventure?

The Story
Chronicles puts you in the shoes of a nameless general. You will name him or her in the beginning, don't worry. It's only odd to have a general named Brandon rampaging through Sengoku-era Japan. This general is learning the meaning of ambition and pretty much ventures all over Japan, seeking battles to test his or her valor on the battlefield. This game is actually interesting. Unlike previous games, this title focuses solely on the development of the main character and his or her allies, rather than a bland and colorless adventure story mode like previous titles. The new feature that I love that really develops the main character's relationship is the side-conversation feature at the end of each battle. The answers you choose to these questions shape your destiny and what path you will follow.

Gameplay
The Warriors formula has been spiced up a bit this time around. You focus mainly on one character, and you are also given three other ones per stage. Using the Nintendo 3DS's touch screen, you can immediately switch to any other general, and access his point of view. It gives the battle a lot more depth and ways to work. Unfortunately the downside of it is that you now have to strategize a little bit. In NO way is it in depth strategy like Warcraft's DotA, or as crazy as competitive Pokemon, but the formula changed a good amount.

Chronicles, and any Samurai Warriors game, uses ""missions"" to progress through battle. While Dynasty Warriors is all about securing your main leader and protecting him, Samurai Warriors is more free and allows you to complete missions to advance the battle. It can range from killing this guy, to escorting this guy. Sometimes it gets bland, but it's overall enjoyable. However, in this game only, failing missions will bring you a load of hurt, so be sure to finish these missions as much as you can. Not completing missions will swamp you and your army with a ton of reinforcements and bad luck. Is Koei's attitude here nothing more than schadenfreude?

In a nutshell, here is the new Warriors formula as a math equation:
A+B = C
2A+B+C = D

Graphics
Graphics this time around are more streamlined and fluid. It is about on par with Nintendo Wii's Samurai Warriors 3, if not better. It is certainly better than the PSP version. Videos and cutscenes are beautiful and with the 3D enabled, it offers a lot more depth and pops out at just the right ways. It's something to experience rather than read about. No, it's not as great as the PS3, but for a handheld, it's very enjoyable.

One problem I had with it is the bland backgrounds. It would be better if they changed certain features. Sometimes, a tree would be the same color as the ground, and it looks kind of boring and dull. I'm still looking for my cherry blossoms!

Music and Sounds
Music is a tad repetitive after a while, but it still sounds pleasing to the ears. Sounds are crisp and not tinny like previous games.

Conclusions and My Opinions
Overall, based on many reports I have been reading, I'm very thoroughly surprised by this game! Most reports from popular sites have swept this game with below average scores, but I see it as a bonus. It's addicting and makes me feel good about myself. I feel that this title is HUGELY underrated. I cannot stress it enough. Being the Koei fan that I am, it's still a vital refresher that the series needed. I don't understand why people have destroyed this game in reviews. I found it very appealing and the 3D graphics superb, for a first launch game!

Score:
-Story - 8/10
-Music - 8/10
-Gameplay - 8/10
-Graphics - 9/10

FINAL SCORE: 33/40

It's not by any means a perfect game, but it's still a good game and deserves a much better score than it has been receiving. Great Game, but a Waste of Potential"
4.0	It has a nice grip to it but my problem where I want to rip this thing off my controller is the case itself gets in the way of the two analog sticks so my character would be moving forward on its on because the case itself. Now it's a good case, love the grip but just be aware of that. Almost as expected..
4.0	Lol, I just looked back a year or so and saw I bought this. Still a fun classics Great
4.0	I have to agree, this is one great batman game. I remember the last being Lego Batman and before that Batman on Sega CD. I like this game a ton, but when I got finished, I really had no desire to play it again. So I say its a good rental. The combat is fun, grappling works great, sneaking is awesome, and the action easy to get into. Don't mention the freakin awesome joker transformation! A great batman game!
4.0	Gave this as a gift and the kids still play them all the time. Im not a huge console game fan (I'm more of a PC FPS player) but my nephews love these and said to rate them four stars! I gave them the whole LOTR set along with the Hobbit. Gave this as a gift and the kids still play them all the time
4.0	Decent gameplay with wonderful setting and harsh, post apo atmosphere. Gets repetitive if you want to clear the map completely but still fun nevertheless. Must buy for post apo fans.
4.0	"I have been wanting to buy this game for a long time.  I held off because I was playing a couple other RTSs at the time.  Here is a quick overview:

Campaign- The storyline and voice acting were pretty weak.  However, the campaign gives you the basic skills to play skirmish and multiplayer matches.  The levels are fun to play, but after about ten levels, the difficulty jump from normal to HARD.

Skirmishes- The maps are fun, and the landing zones are placed just right, so that will come in contact with the enemy quickly.  This game requires a lot of multitasking.  Basically, you need to have a continuous flow of troops and vehicles to keep from getting pushed back.  To get some practice, I recommend playing with a computer ally, against an individual opponent.  Once you've got a strategy, take that computer ally out of the game.

I haven't played online.

I like this game and it looks pretty good with the graphics maxed out.  If you are a fan of RTSs, this game shouldn't disappoint you. Good Real-Time Strategy Game"
4.0	"Metal Gear Solid 2 was probebly the most wanted game for the PS2 besides FFX.  Everyone had high expectations for the game and for the most part, it meets them.  For people new to the Metal Gear games, this game requires that you sneak around.  This isn't a FPS type game where you just blast everything you see.  But it's challenging and fun.
The graphics are probebly the best feature of the game.  The characters have eyes, unlike the first MGS game where the just had dark lines.  Almost everything is destructable.  You can shoot pipes, little bottles, etc.  There are also nice little effects like shoe prints, breath, and the rain effects are pretty realistic.  This game has a first person view where you can shoot guns but can't move and during the rain, you see little rain drops get in your view.
The control is basically the same as MGS with a few new moves.  You can now hang from the rails and you can look around corners and do a quick ""jump out shoot"" at a guard and quickly get back around the corner.  You can either kill a guard or knock them out with a tranquilizer gun.  You can then hide the body in a locker or whatever you want.
Now for the story.  The story plays out threw movies and long conversations through a CODEC where you just see two faces talking.  For anyone who has played Metal Gear Solid, you'll know the story was very good.  For this game, it's intersting but it has a few disappointing surprises...Some parts of the story don't seem to make sense and can get very confusing at times.  Also, there are A LOT of movies.  You can literally walk 5 steps, and then a 5 minute movie will play.  The beggining took FOREVER!  You can't even pause the movies like in FFX.  Not a good thing when you need to go...
For my final say, I think MGS2 is a pretty good game but it just has to many long movies making this a game where you do more watching than playing. MGS2 fun to watch, but what about PLAY?!"
4.0	It's an ok game.  It's not my favorite, but I have no complaints with the game itself or quality of the product. Not bad
4.0	"I'll do this one level by level.

Lvl. 1: Starts out dull and boring.  Enemies look dumb and their AI isn't any better.  To progress through the level, you have to shoot brain-monsters, which allows you access deeper into the area. My first impression was, 'This is incredibly outdated gameplay.'  Still, it was nice blowing things up.  After a bit, you reach the enemy tank, and you're given a powerful lightning spell.  From here on, I was all smiles.  The major spells in Bullet Witch are ridiculously overpowered and it's great fun pushing flaming cars into enemies, or blowing up entire buildings.

Lvl. 2: City level.  It's a bit too spacious- too many wide stretches with nothing going on.  What makes it worse is that the main chacracter, Alicia, cannot run very fast.  You can't hit 'A' for example and sprint.  It's just click, click, click of her high heels, over and over again.  I did have fun taking out the enemy soldiers as they collected in a big group underneath their helicopter, and for the first time, you face snipers. These guys can do one hit kills, so there's a lot of dodging going on.  In actuality, I kind of appreciated the one hit kills. I like playing as a sniper in most games.  Snipers don't get enough credit.

Lvl. 3: Down through the manditory sewer level.  Every game has a sewer level.  After the sewers, it's on to the airport terminal.  More enemies, more snipers, you can shoot out the overhead glass, and you face these weird creatures that look like the exploding enemies in Halo, but with Asian Ghost Girl faces.  From the terminal, you head on to the plane.  There is a boss fight on the plane, and you're literally ON the plane.  Not IN the plane.  I thought this was incredibly inspired game design.  Of course, the boss kicks your butt over and over again until you figure out how to cast your third Lightning spell.  Hint:  Jump to the tail to shoot it in the mouth, and go from there . . .

Lvl. 4: Now walking along train tracks, heading towards some mining-type facility.  Big explosion here.  Good fun.  Just be careful where you are standing when it all gets blown to hell.

Lvl. 5.  Arriving at the militia HQ.  Lots of gunplay.  Plus, you get the tornado spell.  Cast it as much as you can.  It's awesome. AWESOME.

Final Lvl.  It's back to the city again, to finish off the boss.  The boss fight is kind of tedious, especially because the boss' shields recharge over and over again.  Why couldn't it be a one and done?  You'll do a lot of dodging, healing of soldiers and tons of shooting.  Personally, I enjoyed the boss fight.  It was long and drawn out, but thankfully straightforward.  I never got thrown a curve, like, NOW THE BOSS CAN DO THIS, DIDN'T WE WARN YOU?  That kind of stuff feels cheap to me.
Once you beat this monster, it's game over.  Still, you can replay the game and keep levelling up your spells / weapons.

Of course, there are some bad things-
-Alicia cannot sprint, and worse, she cannot dodge and shoot at the same time.  The game SCREAMS for this simple ability.  Also, the crouch feature is useless.
-Enemy AI is all over the place.  Some enemies stand still, letting you blast them away, while others dance around like they're at a rave.  There's very little middle ground.
-The game is incredibly short.  A playthough, even with the endless final boss fight, takes all of 6 hours.  If I had bought this game new and at full price, I'd probably feel cheated.
-Bonus content (new costumes / different playable scenarios) is LIVE download only.

But the destruction . . . that makes it all worthwile. A world of destruction."

I will now give the ""PROS"" and ""CONS"" of the game and even add a ""MID"" as in stuff I didn't hate but also didn't love, but you or others might feel different about it...

PROS:
A great free world to run around in
Has a lot of way you can play it as a Rogue, Warrior, Sorcerer or if you want to them all.
The game play is clean and controls well and easy get use too.
Has a lot of kinds of items, monsters, people and quests to do in the game.
you can make your own character from the ground up and fit the way you like to play him/her.
Creating items like Potions and equipment is the most fun I ever had in making items in a game.

MIDS:
The story in the game seems pretty good but nothing that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.
Graphics and sound are pretty good as well, but not jaw droping.
The game is pretty easy at first, but as you get deeper in the game it will start getting harder.

CONS:
I've had few problems with the Camera in the game here and there...
Lockpicking is WAY to ""easy""
The sound in the game can sometimes can be late for when the sound was supposed to happen.

{My Thoughts}
I'm really enjoying this game, there hasn't been a game like this to come out in a long time. If you ask me I think you should really give this game a try... it maybe not as big and pretty as a few other games that has came out, but I think this game is a gem of it's own and please reamember this is the first game that ""38 studios"" has ever came out with and I think they did great job and I'm looking forward to see what they will do next. :)

Thank you for reading, I hope it helped you and if you have any questions about the ""Game"" just ask. ^^ (N-GAME ARTS) Review Reviews"
4.0	very nice, little unsteady with 2 controllers in it, but, overall, i really like this set up..easy to use, easy to just set the controller in the stand, and leave it.. looks neat, good value, easy to use..
4.0	"I ordered this for my husband as a birthday gift through VRGamerz. I place the order on March 3 and the product arrived on March 24 (a week after his birthday). Granted it was withing their estimated shipping date but I find that to be ridiculous.

No complaints about the item itself. My husband was concerned because he heard it could be difficult to get it to work but he said he just had to download a couple of Microsoft drivers and it worked right away. Works Great but hope you're not in a hurry to get it"
4.0	alright. Four Stars
4.0	"The added trade routes are smart and I feel it encourages many civilizations to try to get along with each other better rather than warmongering quite so much. The other changes are mostly more related to later in the game, but they are smart and add to the game.  Both culture victories and world leader victories are much more robust.

My only gripe (but this may also apply to the base game) is that gold leads too clearly to victory through purchasing city-state alliances.  So far that is the way I have won almost all of my games, by simply buying off enough city states to get world leader. Smart additons to the base game."
4.0	"Midnight Club LA is a very good racing title for Xbox 360. It is an open world racing game in which there are an overwhelming amount of races to take part in. You probably will never run out of things to do in this game, offline or online. The game is a stunner graphically, including some stellar car models and the overall city can be breathtaking. There are several positives to go with some negatives, but if you're a racing fan (esp street/arcade racing fan) then you owe it to yourself to buy this game!

+Positives+

Graphics - As I stated before, the game looks absolutely amazing at times. There is very, very little loading in between races, and during a race you can drive through the entire city with no loading and no frame rate issues. Since this is an open world game there is a bit of drawn in and slow texture loading, but it is very rare and is almost completely removed if you install the game to the hard drive. The interface looks slick (esp the GPS system) and the presentation is pretty well done.

Sound - The car sounds all sound OK at best, and the music (like any game soundtrack) can get repetitive, but it is overall well done. Nothing spectacular though.

Online and Offline modes - several different race types, it is hard to get bored with this game

Customization - From an appearance standpoint, there is an abundance of customization available. Performance wise, not so much.

-Negatives-

Controls/Gameplay - The controls feel a bit loose, so if feels as if you don't have as much control over the car as you should have, even with a very good handling rating. The difficulty could be an issue for more casual players, as the hardest races are brutally unforgiving. As a solution to this, you are never stuck racing only difficult races if you are not up to the challenge.

Car Selection - Over 40 cars may sound like a lot, but not only have all of the cars in the game been used by several other games, it really isn't an impressive list at all. Progression through the game can seem less rewarding as there are not that many cars to purchase/customize.

Can't warp to races - Being an open world game means that you have to drive to a location to where the person who wants to race is, then it gives you the option to race to the starting line. While you can skip this, it would have been nice to be able to select a race from the GPS and warp to the starting line, instead of just setting a marker to drive to. A small annoyance, but it is worth noting.

Overall, I recommend this game to fans of racing games, but no one else. While the game has a lot to do in it, some of it can be frustrating and difficult by today's standards (although I like a challenge). If you are unsure how much you like racing games, rent it, but if you can't get enough street racing, then buy this game! Huge game for racing fans"
4.0	This headset is great to use while playing any game! its really good and the voice is clear when you talk and listen to your friends. I like how the headset also turns to a Bluetooth with the switch of a button, really easy to use and sync! i recommend this headset to all gamers. Good headset!
4.0	"GREAT headphones for the price. Bass is reasonable, highs and lows sound amazing, the audio sounds rich, not washed out like other studio headphones. Very comfortable as well, can wear for hours and will still feel comfortable.

Now, what about the microphone? Well, if you plan to use the mic through 3.5mm make sure you have a decent sound card. I have an MSI B150 Bazooka with on board audio and the mic sounds terrible. I bought a Sabrent USB sound card which took away the hissing sound and made the mic sound a bit better and louder.

I would give this 5 stars if the mic was slightly better. Otherwise, would I recommend these? YES! Great for gaming and listening to music. AMAZING audio, the microphone? Not so much."
4.0	Purchased as a gift.  Arrived promptly and without defect. Purchased as a gift. Arrived promptly and without defect ...
4.0	"If you've played any of the previous RE games, this will be nothing new. It's more of the same basic formula of key fetching to unlock doors and some minor puzzle solving. It's still fun, mind you, but if you're looking for innovation in the gameplay, you won't find it here. If you're looking for a mindless good time and a great way to kill some hours, RE5 definitely delivers.

First off, the graphics are simply gorgeous. It's simply a fantastic looking game, and Capcom really did push the envelope here. Environments and characters are detailed and a joy to look at. Boss enemies are HUGE and fluid. Great lighting effects.

Pros:
-----

- Good replay value. Once beaten, you can go back and replay any chapter with your current inventory and stats. You can try to lower your total completion time for a bonus reward.

- Good number of unlockable weapons and bonus features. 8 new characters/costumes for Mercenaries mode (Timed mode where you try to kill as many zombies as you can for points).

- ability to restart a chapter at checkpoints. This way, you can unload inventory you don't need and have room to carry more stuff.

- a lot of fun weapons. Even more fun when you unlock unlimited ammo mode! They are all a lot of fun to shoot, especially the Magnum, which takes out non-boss enemies with one shot.

Cons:
-----

- timed button pressing can be frustrating. You need to push certain buttons when the onscreen prompt appears. In co-op mode, this can lead to great annoyance if the other guy misses

- horrible item selection system can often get you killed while trying to equip the right item. Can't cycle between inventory quickly. You can assign 4 items (one for each D-pad direction), but others are not assignable.

RE5 is a fun game if you're a fan of the series. There's no much new in relation to previous RE games, but still fun and worth owning. I didn't mind that it felt like playing RE4 all over again. Been there before, but still loads of fun"
4.0	Very good Item Four Stars
4.0	"and I finally beat it. Some people may think it's impossible to beat. There are easier games, but that's besides the point. The graphics are just like any other PS1 game. There's so many tasks in this game. That is what makes it cool.

The Grinch loses all his blueprints for his gadgets while planning to steal Whoville's christmas. He has to search in 4 environments to obliterate everything to complete several tasks in Whoville, the Whoforest, the dump, and Who Lake. and retrieve these blueprints to create his Rotten Egg Launcher, Slime Gun, Rocket Spring, Octopus-climbing device, Marine Mobile and Grinch Copter. That's the basic object of the whole game. If you complete enough tasks and destroy enough gifts, you can open up 3 ""sup-a-dows"" which are doors that lead to cool games inside the Grinch's lair up on Mount Crumpit. The first one has a bunch of poles that you swing from to get to the finish line in the limited time. The second one is where you just smash  as many pumpkins as you can and try to beat your time. The third one is where you just fly with the Grinch Copter through rings to the finish line in the limited time. All 3 of them have limited times. Later on, you can take a sleigh ride to stop Santa! I got 100 percent. Games like ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"" for PS2 was much easier and I only beat that in a couple of days. ""The Grinch"" will take a lot longer, but it's worth playing for the fun of it. I Have Had It For A While...."

I LOVE IT. THE BEST.  JUST BUY IT""."""
4.0	"Corsair Gaming M65 PRO - Black
I am not the gamer in the house but I do like this mouse for my photo editing and other digital media work.
We have several teens in this house that are the gamers. They each have different games that they play
from the typical minecraft to role playing games and they are starting to get more into I guess would call them the
shooter style games.
Each one has things they have liked and disliked about this particular mouse based on what they are playing.
I now am the one who has ended up with it for my digital work mainly because I think they have each their own favorite that they
are not yet ready to part with.
They did tell me they all liked how comfortable it is and they think the LEDS are the best compared to the other brands in the house.  The fit in the hand is really nice and the weight is solid.
However one issue that I forget which game we play but the laser sensor is not as good as it could be when playing.
Compared to ones I have bought for my kids this seems to be a good starter one to get and then might know after using what other features you might need before stepping up to one that is higher priced.
We have found though that price does not mean someone is going to like it any better as we have one who is just as happy with his lower priced gaming mouse because the features fit his level of gaming just fine.
Personally for me I like how comfortable this mouse is and I do not get overly tired even after hours of using it. Good mouse for more than just gaming"
4.0	This is a fairly good game. It easily matches up with COD ghosts. Despite the minor glitches, and at times, redundant AI it isa pretty good game. good game
4.0	Since I refuse to buy a new system, I am forced over time to buy parts and pieces to keep my old stuff running, and this is one of the only new controllers that I find on Amazon, and though the joystick seems to not be as taunt or responsive as the ones made by Nintendo, I can't find those anywhere, also these don't seem to last as long, but way better than madcatz.  this controller has become a neccasary evil of late. Works
4.0	"At first, I was skeptical, especially after learning that it wouldn't be sold at the usual price new games go for. Usually, such a sign is similar to when a movie comes out without being made available to critics for review. And after playing the first portion of the game (the Hong Kong levels), I had a creeping sense of disappointment -- it seemed all too repetitive -- simply run in to a room, get surrounded by a bunch of enemies, and take them out. The use of the right analog stick for all the fighting moves was a definite plus as you could intuitively snap a punch or kick at someone standing behind you, and then just as quickly punch at someone in front or to the right of you. But as soon as the game changed its setting to San Francisco, California, it started to pick up and became more entertaining (I realized the Hong Kong stages were to start off the story and to get you used to the controls). Younger gamers, or those who aren't Jet Li fans, aren't likely to be wowed by ""Rise to Honor,"" but any gamer in his late 20s or older may find a game that's somewhat of a throwback, especially in the shooting sequences. When the enemies hide behind walls and such, and then pop out to shoot, it may not be dazzling, but such presentation has an old-school game feel -- that's a good thing. And at times, the fighting sequences involving bats, chairs and other handheld weapons or objects, remind me of an modernized Double Dragon fighting style. That Jet Li's character Kit Yun doesn't run all too fast only adds to the game's realism. (in most games, your character can run forever at a fast rate without so much as a breath). You can't just walk into a room and pummel everyone to death. You need to do some running, quick stops, sneak in a quick punch or kick, and then move on -- or you'll need to use some strategy, creating space between you and the thugs, and try to get one isolated, and then get in some good licks and continue that pattern. It's good that you can't easily get combos off on an enemy -- not without another coming behind you and knocking you to the ground with a bat. And in the shooting levels, it's good that you can't just jog down a street alley and shoot them all down with ease. So, just as with Jet Li in most of his movies, his videogame alter-ego is realistic in that he's NOT Mr. Invincible and can be beaten or sent reeling if he gives a foe the opportunity. While most might not be amazed when playing this, any one who's an older game or a Jet Li fan will find ""Rise to Honor"" to be a solid, fun game with just the right amount of difficulty. Fun, good for older gamers and Jet Li fans"
4.0	"Okay, I will try to make this sweet and simple. This game is really a fun game. It is a very challenging game, especially fighting raptors. They are actually smart! You have the ability to use your knife to kill them! Weapons look cool, scenery is decent, action is good, on the level of the original Killzone. Pretty good overall and for this price you just cant beat it. VERY CHALLENGING GAME! OMG IT WAS THE HARDEST ONE I EVER PLAYED! Whats cool is you fight a lot of dinosaurs but also have a lot of gun fights! I Highly Recommend!

4.0	"By far the hardest game I have ever played.  I can get pretty frustrated playing video games sometimes, but this one absolutely takes the cake.  I probably did about 3 rage quits before progressing though the second ""stage.""  But something about it makes me keep coming back.  The story is great, but if you aren't up for a challenge, don't even thing about subjecting yourself to Dark Souls. By far the hardest game I've ever played"
4.0	"Here are my complaints: You cannot shut off the controller when watching a movie. It has to stay on. The controllers' battery drains quickly and have to keep charging it. My console heats up pretty quickly so I had to get a cooling fan.
Other than that, I am satisfied with my console. I wish people would post what they didn't like so others can make more informed purchases. Good console with minor nuisances."
4.0	"I enjoyed The Getaway to a great extent.  It has a twisted deep storyline, realistic graphics, and superb voice acting.  You play two characters Mark Hammond, and a cop (Who's name I forgot).  Hammond's story revolves around him doing favors for the Mafia boss Charlie Jolson to get his son back.  Where as the cop's story intertwines with that of Hammonds.  London has been recreated in this game...exactly...down to every storefront.  So I assume, if your familiar with London, then you have an advantage.  Be forewarned though, this game wanted to get accross that you are playing a movie.  That means, there are no ammo counts, no health bars, no health pickups, or maps.  To get around London, you must follow your turn signals on your car.  And if your turn lights are busted up then you need to jack a new car.  You can tell how much health you have by how much Hammond limps (or bleeds.  Perhaps The Getaway's biggest downfall is the gameplay.  I got very tired of watching the characters slow sluggish movement (and when he limps he moves an inch a minute).  To heal your self you must lean up against a wall and wait...and wait...until the bloody or limp disappears.  The targeting system is also a point of concern.  It thinks that some chump a mile off is more dangerous than some guy with a shotgun right next to me.  The cutscenes in this movie, while very long, are very entertaining and lifelike.  The charters in these scenese are so believable I swear I could point them out in real life.  Overall I throughly enjoyed this game.  Oh yeah and one other thing, this game has an ""M"" rating for a reason.  The F word is used constantly.  The violence isnt' all that bad but none of it was really offending to me.  Well The Getway was a ride and I enjoyed it.  Again, it was very impressive. Impressive to say the Least"
4.0	great game. nice history Four Stars
4.0	"My name is Logan and I'd just like to say that this game is freaking awesome. I am big on collecting SNES, N64 and Gameboy games. Rock'n Roll Racing is one of those minor rare games that costs like 45 bucks at videogame stores, got this for a killer deal though and am happy about that. Docking a star though cause of some weird metal stuff on the cartridge that is impossible to get out but at least I can see most of the label art, label is definitely important but other than that... it plays perfectly and is one of the best racing games. Definitely beats Super Mario Kart!

30 bucks though for this game? Killer deal! My name is Logan Ledferd and I'd just like to say that this game is freaking awesome"
4.0	Great value for all these games.  Games are fun to play, this series really pioneered the whole co-op multiplayer online war games thing. Great Value
4.0	Most games based on movies are a bore, but King Kong has great graphics and an intriguing storyline. Sure there are a few glitches, but the game is just pure fun to play. King Kong
4.0	"Playing infamous reminded me of some of the best things about super-hero open games (think Crackdown, Hulk Ultimate Destruction etc.). The basic gameplay of running around the city and wreaking havoc are a blast.

All the powers and weapons are based on electricity and it works very well. The powers act as both weapons (grenades, sniper rifle) and super-powers (force push, lightning).

One thing I did not like, that others seem to appreciate, is the story. Its presented early on like a graphic novel but leaves a lot to be desired. After the first act, I pretty much did not know what the narration was even talking about. Thats either due to bad story telling, or just that is was so dull I stopped paying attention.

I also wished they started the game and story at the beginning, instead of dropping you in the middle. It would have been cool if you started the game as a messenger and your first mission started the story off. Instead, like so many other games, the beginning of the story (and most of the middle, and end) are left as backstory and told with story boards. Which I always get the feeling are used because they are much cheaper than developing a cut-scene.

So, the developers nailed some pretty fun gameplay but the story is a throw-away if you ask me. Also, after about 6 hours of play, the missions start getting old. Some repeat too often other are decent but just lack variety.

All in all, its a pretty impressive game but it could have used some extra mission types, a better story and story presentation. Infamous shines when you are just running around blowing stuff up and jumping around like a true super-hero (or villain). In fact, the game may even be more fun when you play the villain because you get to cause more chaos without worrying about injuring the NPC.

Infamous makes a great rent (6-8 hours) and its a good addition to the PS3 library but it has its faults as well. Its Electric"
4.0	It's not the best Ninja Gaiden game I have ever played (I have played them since they were on NES), but it is pretty fun nonetheless.  I can't wait to see what the next installment may hold on the next-gen consoles. fun times, especially if you like blood.
4.0	A nice change of pace from the newest Madden games that are coming out for the Xbox 360. Graphics are great, you have everything a Madden title is supposed to be, at an attractive price! One of the better Madden games!
4.0	College football fans who owned a Dreamcast had to wait until the last days of the system's life for a college football game, and the results are mixed at best.  Visual Concepts, developers behind the NFL 2K series and the excellent NHL 2K2, put NCAA 2K2 together and did a fantastic job visually, but all the excitement of the college ball atmosphere is missing.  Graphically speaking these are some of the best graphics to ever grace the DC; the players move and react just like they're real life counterparts (except most players seem to have beer guts), and control wise the game is flawless.  The announcers however seem a little behind the play, not to mention they can get rather repetitive as well.  But what should have been the meat and bones of NCAA 2K2 is missing: no BCS bowls (except for the Rose Bowl), only a few school specific fight songs, and the legacy mode is disappointing.  However, if you just want to get out of the NFL arena for a while and you own a Dreamcast, you can't go wrong with NCAA 2K2, but if you need your video game college ball exact from the get go, stick with EA Sports NCAA series. The only college ball on Dreamcast

4.0	While this game was really just one massive promotion project for 7UP, its also a really awesome game. The graphics are great, good level designs, and fun gameplay. Nonetheless; there are a lot of 7UP references you blast 7UP bubbles as your weapon, you collect 7UP icons for bonus points, you drink 7UP for extra health, and in the bonus stage your inside a massive 7UP bottle and collect all kinds of goodies. There are no bosses, but thats cool you fight a lot of enemies through out the game and trying to locate all the cool points is diffcult enough. This game was also ported for the Sega Genesis, there is very little difference. Some of the graphics are a little better on Genesis, but some of the enemies look better on SNES. Overall good game. 7 UP, great drink and video game
4.0	I played this game on X-Box 360, but seems more fun on PC. Using xbox controller with Win 7 64bit, no issues at all. Fun game... Better on PC
4.0	"Intitially, while I was waiting for the game to come out, I knew that if the developers tried to add too much to this tower, it would eventually fall over. In the case of Revelations, there are some added content which is great, others not so much. Die-hard AC fans have played three games arleady, and most likely exhausted all there is to be given. For Revelations, it still stays true to the classic AC feel. Classic enough that they brought back Altair from the first game of old, but the fact that he has a changed look and voice might disappoint players who have played the game series till this point. I can tell in some dialogue that the actor they put on tried to follow the same format as the original voice of Altair, and cudos to him. Nevertheless, the accent takes away the stoic nature. Now, I don't wish to put out that the game is horrible, I say the contrary.

Story-wise, it is the same but with a new twist towards Constantinople. The story was well put together, with two different main objectives for the story line. The ending, and I speak from my own experience, does bring nostaligic players to some sad moments, but I digress to avoid spoiling it.

Gameplay is pretty much the same as Brotherhood, but vamped up slightly to fit the new disc. You now get a hookblade, which vastly increases freerunning and climbing cabability. Also, challenges for different factions unlock different perks, such as weapons or faction abilities. In fights, it was a job well done. The higher ranking officers do sometimes make a fighter finally take the flight, either for difficulty reasons or it just takes too long and isn't worth it. Otherwise, there are many different types of guards that force the player to adjust in mid-battle. And, of course, along with the good old throwing knives and then the infamous crossbow, you get bombs. You get a good selection of bomb types to choose from, which is a good way to determine a sense of style. The only issue I had hear was with some aspects of gameplay, such as sending assassins to do missions across the country. It is the same thing, but with a little more need to always look at the map and see how annoying it is to keep an area occupied. But Ezio is now a mentor, so that is an excuse.

In regards to combining the first game and the second and thirs game, the developers did a good job. I mainly liked the soundtrack from AC1 and was sort of disappointed that the darkness was sort of taken away onward. But this game does a good job combining both styles music-wise. But, that is just me liking music. The game strongly advertised the ability to play as both Ezio and Altair. What that did is sort of put high expectations on how much you get to play as Altair, when in reality it is less than half of what you can do with Ezio. However, this is still Ezio's game and Altair is looking over the shoulder, so if you want to get Revelations just for Altair round 2, find a different reason.

Multiplayer is still fantastic, and the gameplay has been advance for all good reasons. I say that multiplayer was the best thing that developers had done to continue and add off from Brotherhood.

In conclusios, this is a great game for fans (Assassin noobs may have some trouble following the story obviously). Though the main story is short compaired to its predecessors (Especially AC2), it still satisfied me. I don't give it a 5 star rating only for the little annoyances that got me, but the fun factor is all the way up. This game was a good way to close the stories of Ezio and Altair. Ezio has gotten old."
4.0	"First and foremost, don't buy this game expecting to play the original on a different world.  While some of the controls are the same and the characters are the same, the gameplay is very different.  This may turn some people off, and it may make others look at this game is a very different light.
Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy was a great game, and so is the sequal, Jak II.  One of the first things that you will notice is that the ""hub"" world, Haven City, is HUGE! There are numerous alleys, shops, buildings, caverns and dark places for you to explore.  The city is massive and covers a lot of ground.  The setting has been darkened up a bit as well, Jak has gone through some...interesting changes since we saw him last.  His powers have increased...as well as his attitude.
The majority of gameplay is taken up by mission structured objectives.  You need to go to point A and do B and your reward is C.  The missions range in scope from racing to escort missions.  The game developers have obviously taken a hint from the Grand Theft Auto series in terms of gameplay.  Virtually every vehicle can be hijacked and ridden around the city.  Guards are patrolling the streets, and if you make trouble, they will chase you down and shoot some pretty wicked weapons in your general direction- to avoid them you need to either hide or outrun them.
The camera is great, and can be repositioned to help you out with the trouble spots.  As expected, the graphics are smooth and lush, with a great style of animation incorporated into the final product.  There are no load times and the scenery flows together nicely.  As I mentioned earlier, the world on which we find outselves is massive and there are many objectives to accomplish before we can unlock all its secrets.  The addition of a map option is a great help as the size of Jak II's world(s) can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing.
The only thing that detracts from the game is the difficulty level on some of the missions.  I have found myself trying for over an hour at times to clear one objective or another.  The game can be downright brutal, cruel, sadistic and even petty...yet I always find myself going back into the fray for more.  This game is unique and by all means shoud be rented before you go and buy it.  Naughty Dog has tried something new, they have tried to grow with the times and create something that stands on its own.  As mentioned earlier, some might be put off by the new direction that Jak and Daxter have taken, others will applaud the developers for the fresh new look.
Its a mixed bag...some like it, some hate it...the best advice: rent before you buy...its safer that way. Has Naughty Dog done it again?"
4.0	"ModNations Racers: Road Trip is a great game.  Here are my observations after playing it for about ten hours:

Graphics:  The graphics are decent but they could be a better. For a handheld game they are good. I haven't noticed any framerate issues or lag of any kind on a standard Wifi version of the Vita.

Gamplay:  The controls are decent but it's sometimes hard to hold the Vita and hit the buttons you want. This is more of a design issue with the Vita than it is for the game itself.  There are some products out there that will help resolve this issue.

Sound:  The sound is fun and fits well with a goofy racing game.

Replay Value:  Each track has things to collect and race goals.  This makes you want to keep playing the tracks until you unlock everything.

Other Details:  There are so many options for your avatar and your kart that you can really make some crazy looking kart / racer.  The user tracks and multiple game modes make this game a great value.

Overall this is a great game that would be a five star product with a little more polish and a multiplayer mode. Great Game"
4.0	My brother enjoys this game. Four Stars
4.0	Same review as I left for Diablo 3 and expansion. You HAVE to be on the internet just to install or play. That is unforgivable in my opinion as I am without internet sometimes. I still have and play ALL the old Blizzard games starting with the original Warcraft : Orcs and Humans from 1994. I never have and never will play World of Warcraft. As much as I want to there is no way I will pay monthly. good game but Blizzard treated us bad with this set up!
4.0	"Its a cute game.  Reminds you to eat healthy and exercise.  The pedometer is HUGE.  The clip is too tight to actually clip on clothes. Even my scrubs I wear for work (which are thin) I had trouble getting it to clip on.
Not a problem, use your own pedometer.  I don't ""walk"" for exercise, I do other workout tapes, but there is a place to record that.  The pedometer is a reminder to get more steps in the day as an added bonus to your exercise routine.  I like that its played every day.  This is a constant reminder of what your trying to accomplish.
I love the little stick people! They're cute! It's Fun!"
4.0	"This is a good tool if you want to use your PS3 for watching DVDs/BluRays.  It's much easier to use, especially for non-gamers (like my parents) than a PS3 controller.  It pairs pretty easily and uses Bluetooth technology, just like normal PS3 controllers.

It annoys me that one is limited to using a bluetooth remote, rather than a universal remote on the PS3.  I have a Sony TV -- the remote that came with the TV has DVD/Bluray controlling buttons, but the PS3 has no receiver for standard remotes.  That said, this isn't a very expensive tool, and probably makes navigating the system easier than any other remote. Pretty good accessory"
4.0	"Probably my alltime favorite video game franchise with the exception of the Madden football games.  The original Metal Gear was one of the first games I owned for the old Nintendo NES.  And even though the kids today would go back and look at that game and laugh, it was still so far ahead of it's time with it's concept and plot twists.

This game is the equivalant of watching a great Hollywood action movie.  Cutscenes do get a little long on here even more so than on MGS 1 but it does tell a great story with tons of twists.  Something about the Metal Gear games remind me of the show ""24"" or should I say ""24"" reminds me of Metal Gear.  I have to think the creators of ""24"" had to be Metal Gear fans since the show deals with some of the same issues such as treason, corrupt government officials, conspiracies and never knowing when someone you thought was an ally is selling you out.  And you must admit Snake is a bada$$ just like Jack Bauer.

The only reason I'm knocking a star off of this rating is for the same reason that so many other reviewers have.  Having to play 75% of the games as Raiden. Huh!  Come on! Not being able to play this game as Snake and instead playing with the wussy punk Raiden would be like ""24"" replacing Jack Bauer with that guy from ""High School Musical"".  I just don't understand why they did this.  I must admit when I started playing this game and realized this it was like finding out there was no Santa Claus.  Once I got over the initial shock and disappointment though, the game is still great and hard to put down. Another Great MGS Game."
4.0	"I got into the F.E.A.R. phenomena very late in the game, just finally playing through the original a few months back and quickly gobbling up the expansions right after. While there has been some negative press on these additions to the game as being too similar to the original, I highly recommend both ""Perseus Mandate"" and the earlier ""Extraction Point"" for anyone who can't get enough supernatural horror-themed, first person shooter madness.

""Perseus Mandate"" takes place concurrently with the original game and ""Extraction Point,"" letting you play through segments of those games at different locations and times with a separate character.  There's a great sense of nostalgia while hearing the main character from the earlier iterations doing things across a fence or wall, or when coming up from an underground location you had previously gone down in the last expansion. The only odd aspect to this style is that it's never really fully explained why another solider has the same ability to slow down time as the original main character does.

Whereas ""Extraction Point"" was creepy and had a pretty solid horror atmosphere, ""Perseus Mandate"" is much more action focused.  The only major exception is towards the end of ""Interval 04,"" which is pretty much balls-to-the-wall terrifying and easily has some of the most genuinely frightening and seat-jumping moments out of the first game and its expansion. Since so much of ""Perseus Mandate"" up until that point is focused on the shooter and sci-fi elements, the unexpected horror really hits home harder. Cinematic moments also abound, such as being chased through a complex by a giant robot that simply breaks through walls instead of using doors, leaving no safe place to hide.

On the game play front, the difficulty is lessened in that there is a near constant supply of health packs and armor to be found.  It's a rare occasion indeed when you won't have maximum health packs and armor before heading into a firefight.  Several new weapons are also introduced, such as the grenade launcher (have fun avoiding the grenades that can easily bounce back at you!) and the lightning gun, which arcs to nearby enemies and lets you hit multiple opponents at once.

Although the game plays nearly identically to the previous two entries in the series, with the exception of the new weapons changing things up a bit, ""Perseus Mandate"" is still loads of fun and a definite winner for fans of F.E.A.R. More horror/shooter madness!"
4.0	this is a perfect tactical shooter. it embodies that gears of war style play but with fun gadgets and the story line isn't too bad. the weapons are all pretty realistic and the difficulties challenging. it does get a little repetitive though, so make sure to mix it up by using different guns and tactics. Great Classic shooter
4.0	"Samurai shodown was a great series. I played the first one in tedium until I got every ending and it can be considered the 2D parent of soul calibur. (Samurai shodown likely did ""inspire"" soul edge)

The problem is some games age well and some do not. Perhaps it's safe to say that I forgot just how hard these games could be.

Samurai shodown has always been more about timing than combos and if you are used to very fast paced fighters this anthology may disappoint you somewhat. The first few games feel a bit ""broken"" in the multi hit chain department and the big emphasis is placed around ""fury strikes"" which is the equivalent of a hard hitting fierce attack. In addition there is a very slow movement flow which hampers enjoyment. Many of the Samurai shodown characters were ""redone"" for Neo Geo battle coliseum and it seems as if they were a lot more quick and effective in that brawler.

However this is not to say that things do not pick up a bit with samurai shodown 4 and 6.

Many people complain SS 6 has no blood or fatalities BUT it is by far the best in the series featuring EVERY character, decent story progression, a more balanced and combo friendly dueling system, returned disarm and  weapon breaking techniques, and even the opportunity to change up ""spirits"" for each protagonist and antagonist which give you different bonuses and styles during combat.

Pretty much SS 6 can be related to Street fighter Alpha 3. It's spirit styles are akin to different ""isms"" and despite it's huge roster it refused to sacrifice the plot. This is very commendable to put it mildly.

If you love hard fighters I whole heartedly suggest playing the first 2 SS games. They do not have as many options to tweak as the later installments and even on ""beginner"" they can be unrelenting. Also if you enjoy the blood and gore factor the earlier entries are a safer bet.

My biggest disappointment is SS 5. It is not the ""special"" version and not only were the coolest fatalities in the franchise removed from this iteration but it also has NO endings. Even SS 3 which many fans consider one of the weakest links in the series still shines brighter than V.

As far as 2D weapon based brawlers go you cannot get much better than samurai shodown. Last Blade is perhaps the only other title out there that can compete with it.

In closing the price you pay for all 6 of these games is quite a steal.

Pros

+ A weapon based fighter with deep characters and a good story

+ most games feature things in your environment you can damage to reveal power ups or other goodies.

+The fighting physics gradually improve with each sequel

+ First few games offer a very competitive challenge for enthusiasts that like to work hard for their victories.

+Good sound tracks from beginning to end.

+Worth the price just for SS 6 by itself.

Cons

-Jaggy pixels are showing age

-First few games feel a bit slow and unresponsive.

- SS V has NO endings and NO fatalities.

-The number of game options in each title vary so in some iterations you are able to tweak away until you are satisfied whereas in others you are not.

- The text translations can be awful. Some female characters are referred to as ""he"" and there are numerous other grammar errors. If you are a English language elitist this collection will put you in the loony bin!

Worth it? If you like ""retro gaming"" this is a piece of nostalgia heaven. The character designs are vibrant with a lot of lovable personality and underneath the ""bad engrish"" there is a captivating story line. When you think about today's hyped brawlers most of them have begun failing miserably in the plot department and are guilty of shamelessly putting in ""famous icons"" from big names in entertainment just for extra advertising. (Cough. Soul Calibur 4! Cough.) Samurai Shodown is from that bygone age when developers were not afraid to be original and have a franchise stand on its' own merits.

However if you have ""moved on"" to 3D fighters without looking back Samurai Shodown is not going to miraculously convert you or make you reminisce about the days of old. Even on a 2D scale there are titles with smoother sprites and better overall fighting mechanics. (Such as Super Street Fighter II HD mega mix) Because of this I was forced to knock down both parts of my rating by one star. Retro friendly? Then this could be a great purchase!"
4.0	Bought as a gift, came in mint condition. Four Stars
4.0	i'm not done with it yet, but so far i like it quite a bit.  i played rune factory 3 first so i knew what i was getting into. my only mini-gripes: a couple of the bosses so far have been pretty easy.  that could still change though, as i'm not done yet.  also, if there are a lot of characters populating the screen at once, the game slows a lot.  not too often does this occur, just a thing i think others might have said as well.  aside from that, i've enjoyed it.  i would buy it again knowing what i know now. an enjoyable timesink

4.0	okay Four Stars
4.0	"It isn't Fallout 3 or in anyway Fallout 4 for that matter, but it is a good enough game. I hadn't really been a devoted fan of the series though I stumbled on to Fallout 3 when it was re-leased and thought ""wow this is awesome!"" and it was. Still is actually New Vegas although similar is not the same, but it is a good game you will have many hours of game play and unique ways to go about it. Now if you played fallout 3 then you know about the whole Karma thing, in this it isn't so much a big deal rather than how you interact with certain people, and what you do for them it's more about your reputation. The graphics are great or at-least they are on my computer. See where as Fallout 3 was kinda green and mostly apocalyptic looking this is more Wild West and Howdy Partner haha and that is alright. Seeing how it takes place in a desert that works, to me it got a little old after a while though. But the missions are fun and it's a better way to kill an afternoon than watching TV or at least I think it is, keep in mind in Fallout New Vegas instead of your enemies depending on your game level like FO3, they are just programed to be there whether you are ready for them or not. I hope I was helpful Happy Gaming!! New Vegas VS Fallout 3"
4.0	Just make sure you have enough area in your room for the Kinect. I would have loved this except I had some issues with the motion controls. Fun to play
4.0	"I thought this game was great.  I am not the type for RPG games typically, as I usually lose interest too soon before finishing it.  But for some reason I really got hooked on this one.  The story line was fantastic, and game play was fun.  Some say it is repetitive, but I don't see it that way.  It WAS an easy game, and definitely NOT challenging.  However, in the overall context of the game I think making some of the action scenes too difficult would drag the game on too long.  I would guess it took about 12 hours or more to finish the game.  (Not being a RPG gamer that is a long game for me).

Great story, great graphics, strong gameplay.

A big downfall of the game is it seems nearly impossible to level up your character in one pass-through of the game.  In the game the leveling up is done by pleasing the gods and uncovering stars in constellations.  I didn't see anyway to go back and replay areas to finish these side projects. Surprisingly Addictive"

4.0	Thief 1 was one of my favorite games of all time.  The premise of sneaking through the dark with nothing but your wits and a few paltry weapons (guess what, you ain't the Quake marine) gets the ol' blood pumping like nothing  else.  However what were the good folks at looking glass (yes...it is  looking glass and not ion storm) smoking when they decided on system  requirements?  Requiring a Direct x 7 compatible video card is ludicrous.  I don't know anyone who has a system that can run this game.  That is  setting yourself up for disappointing sales guys. A worthy successor to a great game I think.......
4.0	"As with 2k13, the gameplay has improved from the previous iteration, and continues to be the best NBA simulation I have played.  I only play MyPlayer and Association, so the PC version, which has less options than the console versions, is more than ok for me.  What keeps me from rating the game with 5 stars is the fact that the AI is still very questionable.  I'm not sure if this was ""improved"" from the previous year, but the AI definitely needs work.

A few examples of what I've encountered in my MyPlayer mode:

AI trades made puts one team with 5 point guards and 1 center (Nets)
Chemistry is very slow in going up, but very quick in going down--even with the best record in the league and a 12-game win streak, there was only a 1% gain in chemistry
While in game, the AI controlling the point guard changes play every few seconds in offense, resulting in last second shots far outside the 3-point line
AI controlling ball-handler will not pass the ball when I am running to the basket with an open lane, but will pass the ball when I'm running to the basket (without calling for the ball), with defenders around, resulting in a turn-over
AI will randomly pass inbound to no one resulting in a turn-over
And plenty more...

All in all, it's still a great experience, only if not for those small snags. NBA 2K Series Still Rules, AI Still Needs More Rules"
4.0	"I'm a huge fan of WWII shooters, and if you are too, you should buy this game without reservation.  It's loads of fun, and you play different battles for a change.  I'll list some good and bad below.

Bad Stuff:

1) Short: As other reviews have noted, I was surprised by the short game time.  I wasn't paying attention, but I beat in two days (let's say 10 hours of play, tops).  After finishing the epic Half Life 2 lately, this was pretty bad.

2) Not much of a sequel: This game seems to follow the Halo 2 system of sequels.  Much as Halo 2 really was just a short, over hyped attempt at a massive Halo online game (and just a short, cheap rehashing of the first Halo for the single player), COD2 feels the same.  The multiplayer is a BLAST, but it feels like that was the real design here instead of the single player stuff.

Middle Ground Stuff:

1) Graphics: The graphics aren't bad, but they didn't blow me away. I liked the look of it, but again, recent efforts are a leap ahead of this graphically.  The smoke effects are AWESOME and very helpful for game play, so the game isn't without innovation, but they lacked the crisp texture of Half Life 2 (not to be a fanboy).

2) Linear Game Play: Some reviewers are complaining about linear game play.  Well, guess what, it's a shooter with a story line, so I didn't expect anything different.  You have to follow certain cues.  The levels are rather large with a short load time, and if they were more expansive or the story harder to follow, the game play would suffer.  The action is great, and the objectives are always crystal clear, so no complaints about the linear game play.  I hate shooters where I'm wandering around wondering what to do next, and this never happened here.  I always knew where to go, and if linear game play is the price I pay, it's a welcome price.  This genre doesn't lean to open ended game play, so I think this like complaining there's not enough violence in a romantic comedy.

3) AI: The AI is mixed.  At times, you get pre-generated Nazis perched out waiting to ambush you, but sometimes if you charge a building, the flank you and pull off some nasty surprises.  If you charge the same building on a re-play, you'll not they use totally different tactics.  Even throwing grenades isn't a sure thing since sometimes they throw back.  You get a mix of good and bad AI here pending on the level and circumstance.

Good Stuff:

1) Health System: COD2 avoids the unrealistic magical health packs that heal you and put you back in the fray perfectly healthy (where's the realism there?!).  Instead, you can suffer a certain amount of damage right away and still live.  If it's too much damage all at once, you die (a grenade, a torso or head shot, etc).  However, if it's a small wound, your vision gets screwy, and your aim gets worse, and you recoup in a few seconds if you can take cover.  Repeated hits, though, and you die on the spot.  It enhances the crouch, lay, stand system by making cover make a real difference.  It feels rather like a Halo ""force field"" system, and it works well.  Instead of watching a health bar and scrounging for band aids, you use your head and stay frosty, and you'll survive a firefight.  The health system makes you think instead of waste time doubling back for that health pack you left at the Nazi desk three building back.  Well done, great game play.

2) New Battles: While staples such as Stalingrad and D-Day are there, you play a different part of those battles.  You do a lot of the African campaign and some unique European battles you haven't done before.  The battles on Hill 402 at the bunker are pretty awesome.  I've seldom been as engaged by a WWII shooter as I was killing mortar teams and fighting a mounting Nazi advance, scrounging for ammo during brief lulls.  Well done.

Overall, this game is great.  It's short, so you may wait for it to drop 10 bucks, but the online play more than makes up for the brief nature of the single player.  If you're a WWII shooter fan, this is a must for your collection.  You'll have a good time and enjoy some COD2 mechanics. Great Shooter, here is the good and the bad"
4.0	If you liked the previous games you'll love this one. Its a great game to just turn your brain off and shoot things. Fun and better than the original
4.0	I was skeptical of enjoying this game. Far Cry 2 had issues. One HUGE issue was you could not save your progress in relation to how far you advanced in the game. Far Cry 3 is a joy to play. There is a lot to do. It has great upgrade weapons. Fun. Was Pleasantly Surprised
4.0	While it's not as good as Soul Caliber or Dead or Alive 2, it's still near the top of the list of 3D fighting games on the Dreamcast.

4.0	"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan stays true to the once popular cartoon series and comic books. Each of the turtles are playable and all of their major enemies have been included. Increasing your life meter can be done by grabbing the turtles' favorite food, pizza. Gameplay is better than average. Each turtle has their appropriate weapon. Every weapon has the same power so the longer weapons of Leonardo and Donatello are the most useful. One button is used for attack and the other for jumping. Jumping seems a bit tight, meaning you can't get too far on a jump. Jumps are best used to go straight up to avoid enemies or making a hop on to the next step up. One other attack is done by crouching and pressing the attack button. This will throw a shuriken. Levels are broken down into stages. When you lose a turtle on a level and have others left you will be brought back to the beginning of the stage you were last on. No continues are offered so you will have to make it through without losing all 4 turtles. Before each level or when a turtle goes down you have the option of selecting another. It is probably best to begin the game with either Raphael or Michaelangelo so you can have the guys with longer weapons for the more difficult levels.
Many small enemies have been created for the game. Your majority of attackers though are from the television series and comic books. Those would be the Foot Soldiers and the Mousers. Most can be defeated with one hit so the challenge should not be too difficult. The whole game takes place while you progress to the right. Graphics look really good. Level backgrounds are detailed enough to give you an impression of where you are. Characters all look like themselves. The turtles can only be identified form each other by their weapons. Sounds are okay but all of your attacks sound the same. You can't hear a difference between a katana blade and a bo staff. If you are a fan of the turtles then Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan should not disappoint you. For those who don't care for the turtles then this game doesn't offer anyhting you can't find somewhere else. As far as action games go this one is not too different from the majority. Pretty good"
4.0	have most of the ND. this is my first download. the prices are getting a little too high so I might not be following the series after this. the game itself is normal ND good puzzles, ok plot.  lots of backing and forthing. wish, for the price, the characters would move or do more. starting to think I'm getting played by HerInterActive ok. normal Nancy Drew games getting costly
4.0	"I'll cut to the chase: Pure is a fun game, even though I usually don't play extreme sports or technical driving games.

Look, I'm long past my teen years. I grew up slamming the single red button on my Atari 2600 joystick and winning free ships in games that rewarded fast reflexes. This means I'm not too good at doing complex button combos (that means YOU, Heavenly Sword) and I don't have much patience for configuring a racecar with 500 separate components (sorry, Gran Turismo).

Pure strikes a good balance between casual simplicity and hardcore complexity. People like me can get started and slam through a few races without much hassle, while gamers who want to tweak every little thing have the ability to do so. I like how it's possible to play without having to earn ""licenses"" or pass skill tests. All too often, driving games force players to go through a lengthy training period which, in my opinion, is a major drag.

Additional thoughts:
*Good graphics--tracks contain lots of details and areas to explore, all in stunning physical settings.

*Online play isn't as fun for the casual player as the offline races because most people online have fully upgraded and tricked out ATV's.

*If you have an HD TV, the game runs at 720p resolution (I'm ready for more 1080p games!).

*Rumble and SixAxis motion sensing are supported by Pure.

All in all, Pure is a decent game. Anybody who wishes that skateboard/snowboard/BMX style tricks were possible in Motorstorm probably will dig Pure. 3.5 stars from a twitch gamer"
4.0	"Update 3/18/2017:

So this game hasn't changed much at all since I bought it. However, the one problem I have is the fact after I bought this game they came out with ""the following"" which was basically this game with extra content added on. So if you bought this game right away then that means you need to pay more money for the extra content that was tacked on for people who have recently started buying this game but getting ""dying light: The following"" instead. They basically get this game plus that with no extra charge. But if you helped support this company by buying the game first then you will just have to pay extra to get the extra stuff. That kinda ticked me off quite a bit. I enjoyed the game, but when everyone I know who has this game now is playing ""the following"" part of it im stuck running through the same streets alone while they are exploring new places.

That is unless I want to spend more money just to get the extra stuff others got for free with the base game. And with the company constantly sending me e-mails back when it first came out how I need to try out the new stuff in the game when I didn't have it was even more of an annoyance. This doesn't change my review much other then buy ""dying light: the following"" if your looking at getting this game cause this one might leave you disappointed when everyone else is playing ""the following"" while your waiting around in your zombie filled city.

Original review:
Okay I got this after seeing a guy lets play it. He played through the whole thing and I watched the whole thing. I still bought the game (so there game companies who think those LP's are bad) I liked how it looked, it looked fun and a bit scary.

I am not a fan of zombie games but this one was different. Exploring, as well as jump parcoring, and some crafting added into the mix. Had a feel of the first assassin creed games in a way.

I had fun, up until the last level of the single player game. I found one spot to be quite annoying and having to play it over and over again. Basically running away down a corridor and kept failing a jump, or getting taken down by zombies etc.

Only thing is, after I beat the game. I had no real interest to keep playing there wasn't anything more, wasn't much replay-ability. Maybe in a few months/years I may start this game up again to play through it but once you beat the game there isn't much else to do. I have seen the recent DLC for the game with buggys but I don't go for DLC so I am out of luck.

One other cool thing is that there is also an app you can play while away from home (such as at work) where you send out runners to collect items and such and then you can actually have the items sent to your game where you can pick it up while playing. I found that this wasn't very useful near the end of the game mainly only near the beginning. And even then, you have to play the app for quite a while leveling up your runners in order to be able to get a lot of valuable items. But hey an added little thing is nice.

Pros:
1. Fun running, exploring, crafting type of zombie game
2. Feels like the first assassin creed games in a way
3. Has an app you can play while away from home (at work etc) which helps you in game
4. Can take up a bit of time so you will have plenty of fun in the long run hopefully

Cons:
1. The story is bland, and forgettable
2. It starts to feel a bit repetitive after a while
3. There are some levels like the very last one that can be quite difficult for no reason other then to be difficult
4. Once you beat the game there is little incentive to play more.

I am thinking the game creators are probably gonna make a sequel some day after all the DLC maybe. There seems to be a possible sequel story in mind but you never know. Anyways thats all from me, hope my review helped. Better hurry up and get to the store and buy this before night falls and the worse zombies come out."
4.0	Played some mean Shantae Half Genie Hero with it. Not bad so far. Not bad so far
4.0	We already have the previous Zumba Fitness game. This one has way better graphics. Plus the songs are more fun to dance to and all while working out. Great buy. Fun, exercise and better graphics
4.0	Story was really short, but the content made up for it, but pretty good for it's price, not worth $20 on PSN store Worth the $10
4.0	Personally I enjoy this game more than the ps2 GTA's. This has a better story to it. It most likely won't be as good as gtaIV but its still a great game. Great cheap game
4.0	fun game. action never stopped, which really was enjoyable for a FPS. Four Stars
4.0	Graphics are great. Alot of actions. God story line Four Stars
4.0	This game is really good. I only wish it was longer. I hope I won't have to wait too long till they come up with part 3 of this great game. Now if you  have your doubts get Metro 2033 first, that one is cheaper and not much different. You could also try to read the book on which these games were based, it will add to overall experience. I love it
4.0	Great game but don't forget to save!! If you're a fan of Fallout then you'll love this of course! I love how my name is being pronounced by people in the game. Don't forget to save!
4.0	"Company of Heroes is a fun mix of old RTS games with upgraded graphics and a new trick here and there.  I don't think it is anything that will set the RTS world on its head nor do I think it brings anything to the table that could be considered revolutionary.

The Campaign mode puts you in command of limited US forces in small variations of real battles in WW2 around the invasion of Normandy.  The Campaign mode is strictly United States (the Germans are available in the Skirmish mode but not the Campaign).  The Soviets, Italians, Brits, etc. are not represented in this game.  In addition to the limited countries you can play (mainly the US) the units available have also been somewhat downplayed.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as your resources are limited and you only want to bring to bear what is necessary to win the map.  So you won't see Lee's and Stuart's on the battlefield, the only tank available to the US is the Sherman (in a couple variants).  Sure, you can spend resources on the M10 Tank Destroyer but given its limited use and the fact that the Sherman in this game can go toe-to-toe with Tigers it isn't necessary.  Also, you can spend your command points to unlock the Pershing tank (so it is there if you are willing to get to it).

To help make less feel like more CoH has done two things.  First, they've added the ability to specialize your army in one of the three ways (Infantry, Airborne or Armor) that will change the way you fight slightly and may add an additional unit here and there or alter the way an existing unit functions as you unlock new features.  For example, if you spend your points specializing in Infantry your units can now lay sandbags, you get access to mean tank-killing Rangers and eventually (if you can save up enough resources) you can send for resupply that delivers to your base a random assortment of units.  Airborne, as the name implies, specializes in airborne drops of infantry and AT guns and later heavy weapon supplies like machine guns and motors that can be manned by nearby units.  Armor will eventually unlock access to the heavy Pershing tank.  And secondly, they've tried to add upgrades to units to help them maintain their effectiveness throughout the game (as stated earlier, your unit cap is fairly low in comparison to traditional RTS games).  The Sherman tank can be upgraded with a 50-cal machine gun on top to help its effectiveness against infantry while Riflemen can be upgraded to use Grenades, Sticky-bombs and BAR's.  Essential each unit has at least one upgrade available to it.  This means you may not have to sacrifice your existing riflemen to make room for a tank when the option to build one becomes available.  Both of these items help flesh out the game but they don't entirely get rid of the feeling that for an RTS game you are limited in your choices.

So how do the units you field behave? Well, this is a mixed bag.  Sometimes they do things that make you smile at their intelligence (diving for cover, supporting each other, etc.) but for the most part they are as stupid (if not more so) than units from previous RTS games.  Tanks and other heavy weapons will still stand on the sidelines while a Riflemen squad gets chewed up rather than move up and engage.  When Tanks do engage they not only move up to within range of their weapons (which has been cut significantly in this game to keep them from firing all the way across the maps) but they drive right up against the enemy unit until they are actually running into the enemy tank.  What is up with that? If more than one mechanized unit has to move over the same stretch of ground they spend more time banging into each other and moving back and forth than actually covering ground - often the units you were sending them to support will be dead before the mechanized units can organize themselves into a column and drive there.  When they do get there you have to manually reorient them so that their weaker rear-armor is facing away from the enemy (something that they are not smart enough to do themselves).  You also have to make sure they are positioned so that they have a clear line of fire on the target or they will continue to put round after round into a berm (or some other minor obstruction) indefinitely and never make contact with the enemy unit.  When you order a tank to move you should do so in a small series of steps as you carefully work to navigate them one at a time out of your base or they will drive right over the top of your defenses (sandbags, walls, barb wire, etc.) destroying them.  Needless to say, path finding in this game is the worst I have seen in an RTS to date with the exception of most of the infantry units which can find their way around but have their own unique quirks which include the inability to jump low walls or swim shallow rivers.

Path-finding and unit variety out of the way, the real selling point for CoH is its awesome graphics and richly detailed environments that can be destroyed.  The graphics are superior to any other RTS that I have played and the ability to control the camera, using it to zoom in for an over the shoulder view akin to a FPS if you so choose, is something all RTS games of the future should include.  For most of the game you will probably be zoomed all the way out (as I was) and even wishing that you could zoom out further to make keeping an eye on all the action at once a little easier.

The environment is richly detailed with lots of terrain types and plenty of things to blow up or hide behind.  Buildings can be leveled and holes can be blown into the earth.  The ground will become black and scarred the longer you fight over it until it is just a mess of blackened holes with no trees, fences or buildings left standing.

The last item I bring up may or may not be an issue for you depending on the level of realism you like bundled with your RTS.  Personally, I like a lot, and so in that area CoH really falls short.  While the units look like they are supposed to they don't behave that way nor are they really balanced against their real-life counterparts.  For example, an AT gun can absorb several hits from the main gun on the tanks, as can armored cars which take several hits to bring down.  The Sherman can go toe-to-toe with the Tiger tank and all vehicles have a very severe limit on their weapon ranges.  In addition there is some luck mechanic working in the background because you can take two identical enemy units and take down one without issue and the second just seems to be absorbing all damage you are sending its way.  When your units get hurt bad enough just hit the retreat button and they will flee at warp speed back to your headquarters (they get an armor boost to match that speed boost) where they can be pumped back up to full strength.  It is especially annoying fighting a unit only to get it worn down at last, then it retreats and later you have to fight it again when its back to full strength.

Anyway, CoH is a game with its fair share of flaws and it brings very little innovative advancements to the table.  Under the polished finish it is the same old RTS game at work.  But it is flashy and in the end it is still fun.

EDIT:  I should have pointed out that the profanity is over the top at times, even for a war game.  The units don't need to swear every time you give them an order.  Anyway, the swearing isn't a big issue for me, but no way to turn it off (that I saw) makes the game unsuitable to be played with the volume up in mixed company. Fun, but still an RTS"
4.0	"Great game if you love Team Fortress 2. If I had to explain Overwatch with just a single phrase, I would call it ""Team Fortress 3"". Blizzard took Valve's super popular class based team shooter and decided to give it a massive facelift and a colorful world.

Pros:
-Super polished, as is expected from a company like Blizzard
-Constant updates, keeps the meta changing and all content is free
-Microtransactions are only for cosmetics, even if you pay an extra $100 for loot boxes, it gives you no real benefit gameplay wise.
-Seems like Blizzard in general is mostly listening to the player base and trying to make them happy.
-Due to matchmaking trying to put you in games with other players of approximately the same skill, even people who are not very good at FPS games can enjoy this game.

Cons:
-Only competitive game modes exist permanently (so far, as of the end of 2016)
-With any competitive only game, the salt can get pretty extreme
-With most players, they will eventually have their fill with the game, getting burnt out on the game is a big problem.
-Blizzard pricing, which means, the game will likely never fall below $30 for the base game for the next 5 years.
-Microtransactions in a premium priced game, also, how little you get for money spent on microtransactions.
-Blizzard as a company is not very nice to any possible alternatives to the class-based competitive shooter genre, Battleborn was a stillbirth due to their aggressive promotion of Overwatch, even if Battleborn was closer to being like LoL than TF2 gameplay wise.

considering how little content is in the actual game, its surprising how much enjoyment you can get out of this game. The game was basically cobbled together from the remains of ""Project Titan"", and it is a surprisingly well put together game considering how it came about. Great game if you love Team Fortress 2."
4.0	It definitly improved from the first one from the upgrading of the vehicles.  Like the one before this one it was fun. Good
4.0	Take 'Conflict: Freespace', polish up the already-gorgeous graphics, and you have 'Freespace 2'. Essentially a re-run of the original, this adds new ships, new weapons, at least one outstanding graphical effect (capital  ships now attack each other with 'beam weapons' - giant shafts of light  that cut through ships like a hot knife through butter), and some new  cut-scenes, all wrapped up in a sturdy cardboard box. At the risk of  souding boring, if you liked the original, you'll like this, as it's more  of the same - the controls and interface are identical, and it's just as  derivative of 'X-Wing' and 'Wing Commander' as it ever was, with an  emphasis on fast action and spectacular effects. It has absolutely no  depth, and very little replay value (the missions are often  tightly-scripted, and replaying them is often quite dull, as you know  exactly what's about to happen), but it's the best combat flight simulator  on the market. One tip - try and play the original first, as this game  doesn't usher you into the flow of play gradually, it drops you right in  the thick of things from the first mission. More of the same
4.0	"Yup. Bought it, beat it, sold it, and found myself wanting to play again.
Really excellent portrayal of a fictional Colorado and surrounding Southwest. I found myself seeing stretches of I-70, I-25, US 285, Garden of the Gods, Idaho Springs, Pueblo, Longmont, San Luis Valley, Durango, etc.

The art based on the location is nice and welcoming, but the feel of driving fast, open roads with traffic at dawn, sunset, at night, sometimes part of a race, sometimes a challenge, and sometimes just seeing what there is to see and be found--it's unique among games. Semi-reminiscent of Burnout Paradise, but the actual immersive feel and fun is more akin to Red Dead Redemption (one of this game's influences) or Sleeping Dogs.

I would say this is the videogame equivalent to Vanishing Point, with a dash of Cannonball Run, and a touch of On the Road. It's open, free, and captures the feel of the West all while letting you race and do silly things.

The multiplayer piece is nice too--sort of a cross between Project Gotham and Dirt. Enough fun in that to keep you coming back and challenging your friends and enemies.

Beware though: I was disappointed in a controller with very few layouts (I think only 4) and can't receive custom mapping. Your ride can't be customized either--no gearing, no brake adjustment, ride height, just nothing except performance upgrades. In that it sets itself apart from the core Forza series.

But if you want a racer that's more about huge drifts and spinning tires than clipping apexes, then you'll probably enjoy this. So good I bought it twice."
4.0	For what I paid this game is good. I bought this for 25$ on amazon day with a discount I had through amazon. I wouldn't have bought this for 40$. This game is fun with friends however I find myself getting quickly bored with its gameplay. It is very much the same thing over and over again. Not in the fun grinding way either. Luckily I didn't pay much soooo for what I paid its good. If you are paying more than 30$ for this game.... I'd wait maybe til black friday or find a used copy somewhere. Bought for 25$ its fun with friends but....
4.0	"I'll start off by saying that I have not played all of the previous titles (MG, MG2, etc.). I have played the original MGS and I enjoyed watching my friend play MGS2. It was hilarious since he's a button-masher and easily frustrated.

Having established that I'll give my objective review.

__Single Player__
The loading screen was clever, and wasn't as long as people complained about.
First starting off the game -- before the title screen even came up -- is interesting and a bit confusing at first. But when I hit the ""X"" button the ""channel"" changed; it's then that I realized what it was supposed to be. So I surfed these channels for a bit until the main title came up. They were hilarious and just amazing to watch in their brillant colors/graphics and clarity. I happened across a parody of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" where the lady had to identify one of the PMCs. Heh, there was even a cooking show that was cooking up snakes in a bunker.

The game then began, credits rolling over the occaisional cutscene still. Interesting to watch, but I was glad that I got caught up on my MGS before starting. I could see where someone picking up this title with no previous knowledge would become confused real quick. (Thank goodness there's a recently released MG Database!)

Gameplay is fun, especially adapting to your surroundings with Octocamo. It does take some getting used to, but it's basically 3rd person with the ability to shoot over-the-shoulder or in first person down the sights (ironsights, rail, red-dot, scope). Customization is huge. And very fluid after you bump into ""Drebin"" and begin utilizing the Drebin points system. I like how this was utilized. Sell off weapons that you can't use because of their ID tags (future tech disables other users) and then use the credits toward purchases of mods. Take your M4 and utilize the rails for a laser sight or Master Key. The environments in general look great and looking down the weapon sight has that realistic feel to it.

I like how they incorporated the iPod into your inventory, definitely some potential there.

__Multiplayer: Metal Gear Online__
This was utilized quite nicely. The only gripe I have is that you have to register for a Konami name, then a Game ID. Which can't match. Seems redundant, until you realize you can have multiple Game IDs to each Konami name. The first character you create is free. Customize your PMC soldier however you wish.
The Drebin Points are utilized differently, instead of picking up weapons, it's based off of kills, captures, achievements (Knock an enemy out and gain some points, # of headshots, etc.). Then upon your respawn, customize your inventory up to the amount of points you snagged, or retain them until the next time for even better weapons.

The controls are the same (Items/Weapons, 3rd person, over-the-shoulder, and first person) and there's a nice tutorial that you can go through to get you up to speed.

You can also customize your abilities. And the best part is that they're not ""locked."" You can change them inbetween matches so that you're increasing the stats on each one. You have your choice of 4 abilities, choose from all sorts of categories; from CQC, Knife Mastery, Sniper, Assault, ""Trickery"" and even some of the SOP specials. The SOP allows for teamwork on the network, utilized through the nanomachines, allowing for you to know where everyone is, and if they're under fire or perhaps just knocked out. The more you use an ability, the closer you'll get to advancing it to the next tier/level of mastery.

Definitely a lot of fun; looking forward to advancing the skill sets.
And definitely recommend MGO for gamers looking to play online, advance in skill, and utilize teamwork.

__Overall__
Definitely fun, and looks great. A great stealth title, plus a fun online experience for you and some friends.

Would recommend playing or reading/watching the previous titles to get up to speed on the background story. Review from someone who hasn't played MGS in a while"
4.0	"Gothic 4 was a purchase on a whim.  I had a few days to burn until Fallout New Vegas came out and I was looking for something that would keep me occupied over the weekend.  I had known about it for a couple weeks but didn't expect much from it.  While at Gamestop, it caught my eye and I decided to give it a try.  About a week later, I'm still playing the game and enjoying it immensely.  It's got it's problems but nothing that kills it for me.  Hit the jump to see my first impressions of Arcania: Gothic 4.

From what I understand, the Gothic series is pretty big in the UK but never really hit home in the states.  We've gotten the games before but they usually received mediocre reviews with little fanfare.  So, before it ever hit shelves, Gothic 4 had that going against it.  Plus, throw in the fact that you probably never heard of it before me telling you (unless you're an RPG buff) and the game could float away into obscurity.  If that happened, no one would notice, but you should.  Why should you care about this game?  Because it's not half bad and if you have taken a liking to games such as Oblivion - third person RPG's with swords, spells, and quests - you may very well find yourself enjoying it.

The game begins with a no named character who is a shepherd in a small island village.  His wants to marry his girlfriend but her father forbids it.  So, the father sends the man on three trials which basically teach you game mechanics.  After your final trial and subsequent approval from the father in law to be, you and your betrothed make plans to set sail for the main land to go explore for their honeymoon.  As you set out to meet your friend Diego who will transport you to the mainland, the village is attacked by an mad King's paladins as they ravage across the lands looking for a mythical shrine in the mountains that has some sort of holy forge.  Tragedy strikes and your betrothed is dead and you are left with a burning hatred in your heart.  Diego, who also survived the attack, informs you that he will take you to the mainland to search for this mythical shrine to keep it away from the mad King and to get your vengeance...and with that, Arcania: Gothic 4 begins.

The story isn't the games strongest point but that doesn't mean it's not manageable.  The characters are a little dry and there are plenty of issues with the text (some not matching what's being said and others not making much sense) but the story isn't bad as a whole.  It continues the story and gives you clear objectives to complete.  You will always know what you need to be doing and in most cases, where you need to go to do it.

The gameplay, as I mentioned earlier, is a lot like Oblivion.  It's not as detailed or open world as Oblivion and the quests are more straightforward, but the gameplay and the way you deal with villagers is the same.  You will begin the game (after the tutorial) by going to a village and completing quests.  You will have one main quest and a couple side quests.  They can all be completed together since the world isn't too big, but you can skip the side quests if you don't want to be bothered.  When you finish the main quest, you usually get some nice armor of the region (for your specific class) and then you can move on to the next village where you will rinse and repeat.  Each stop at a village brings you one step closer to finding out about this temple with the forge in the mountains.

There aren't classes in the game, but you can sort of make your own.  For instance, there are three types of ""classes"" you can make along with any combination of them.  I usually go with melee characters so my guy has a shield, a one handed sword, and the heaviest armor.  I could have also gone with a ranger type class and used leather armor with bows and knives.  Finally, there is a mage type class that wears robes and dishes out spells.  Each time you level up, you will be able to choose from a pool of talents where you would like to grow your character.  There are health and strength for warrior type classes, precision and agility type talents for the rangers/rogues, and all manner of spells for the caster.  This allows you to create a unique character and play any way you wish.

The graphics in Gothic 4 aren't that great.  It's workable, but it won't be turning you head as you cross a vista or walk into a valley for the first time.  I even caught the occasional pop in of grass trees while running through a zone.  Don't let this deter you from the game though.  It's not broken by any means, just not up to snuff with some of the AAA titles you see on the market.

Combat in Gothic 4 depends on your ""class"" that you have chosen.  I wield my sword and shield so I do a lot of hacking and slashing.  I also have access to my bow and magic spells by hitting the RT or RB respectively.  If you played a character other than the warrior, you would rely on one of these instead of the sword and just use your melee weapon as a backup.  The combat is streamlined nicely and you can hit LT to target an enemy, bringing up it's health bar and auto locking onto it so you can keep up with it's movements.  Enemies dead bodies can be looted and you can keep/sell anything you find in the world, much like in other open world games.

I have to say, I'm kind of shocked by this game.  I didn't expect it to be as enjoyable as it is.  I thought it would be one of those games you play for a weekend and then trade in because it doesn't have the depth to keep you occupied.  That's definitely not the case.  Arcania: Gothic 4 is actually a pretty good tale that has fulfilling combat and a nicely fleshed out world to keep you busy.  Don't go into it expecting to to find the next Oblivion.  If you do, you'll be upset.  Instead, look at it as a smaller developers attempt to create something new in an already overflowing game type.  You may be surprised by how much you enjoy it. First Impressions: Arcania: Gothic 4"
4.0	Fun game I enjoy it a lot and play it often.  Just enough of a challange to make it interesting..would recommend this game Cradle of Rome
4.0	This game is very entertaining,It is like you are watching a Movie, the graphics are very good, and the game mixes a good blend of fighting, shooting and even some driving. This all said the controls at times feel awkward, controlling the camera sometimes gets you killed due to no fault of your own, but if you can get past that, you will really enjoy this game. Love the game but sometime the controls get in the way
4.0	Good game.  It's not too hard, has lots of visuals, and a realistic feel.  I thought all PS3 games had this appeal and gameplay but after playing through several other games this one clearly stands apart. Buy this game and your PS3 is justified.
4.0	Loved it and played it a few times Four Stars
4.0	"When donald duck and cloud strife(i think thats his last name) are in the same game it will sell..it sells to two varietys of people..final fantasy lovers and kids/people who like disney...and people will love it because it has cloud, aeris, goofy, daisy, tarzan, alice, and yuffie??..im not sure why they choose yuffie..think about it though, if this game didn't have ff and disner in it would u like it?..u miiiight but i personally would think its just..lowley mediocre...but with disney and ff its just a little bit above mediocre, barely made the 4 stars...for one thing this game only has to focus on 3 charcters because everybody else knows the rest of the characters and their personalitys...the story though is pretty good..i like the characters..except for sora...and it is nice to see cid and cloud again...but shhesh wat did they do to wakka??...wakka isn't wakka!!! thats not wakka!!!.....

in the gameplay department is supposed to be where this game shines...americans hate turn based combat(i like it and i would of preferd this game to be turn bases) so they make it real time...the only problem is....well.....if i want a beat em up ill play devil may cry or lord of the rings... it would of ben all right if i didn't wish it was turn based the whole time...thats what happens when u make a turn based type of game into a real time game and turn based fans play it...and the game is just a button masher... cloud and donald duck in the same game"
4.0	"Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: TTM

I never even heard that this game was coming out when it first released, but then my friend came over and he had bought it on a whim, and we fell in love.

This is the best Mario Sports game out there and differs from the other sports titles in the Mario series. It is rather refreshing to see a Mario game where the characters are not playing soccer to, say, free the twelve star maidens to chase Bowser away from the land, so they can party all night. This game is lacking any type of story, other then to win a tournament. It is full of out right hatred for the other players, and is quickly evident. The characters begin each match with a taunt, and then continue to bash each other around into electrical fences. (I really enjoy the sound of Daisy screaming as she hits an electrical Fence) It is the most fun I have ever had playing a soccer game.

The basic play is you and a team of 5 others (Sidekicks) is on the field competing against another team of 5. It will take tackles, shells, and the Captain?s (main character) super striker move to beat this match.

Over all this was a great game. Its graphics were not the best in the world, but they suited very well for this game. The one player mode was pretty fun, but where this game is best played in is multi-player mode. The controls are quick and easy to master, which is good for any player, new or veteran.

I give Super Mario Strikers an 8 out 10. This is the best Mario Sports game out there!"
4.0	"I'll keep my review short and sweet. I was very afraid that this game was going to be one giant, no skill button masher like all of the low star reviewers stated. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that you do need a bit of skill to pull off many of the maneuvers in this game. There are lots of clever puzzles to solve and the fights really pull you in and captivate you to make it more than just a ""button mashing"" experience. The graphics and sound are some of the best the industry has to offer. I've seen screenshots, but you have to play the game and experience it first hand to really appreciate the awesome graphics and frame rate. I have nothing but good to say about this game. It's a destined classic. Even if you're not traditionally into these kinds of games (like me) you should at least check it out. It might really surprise you, especially if you're into mythology, beautiful graphics, top notch controls, superb gameplay, and/or graphic ultraviolence! This is a very colorful title that every PS3 owner needs to check out. Not just a button masher. This is an instant classic."
4.0	"The Dreamcast is the next generation of gaming machine from Sega, most well known for its Sonic the Hedgehog games. With Dreamcast, Sega moves beyond Sonic into a heavily graphic and net-savvy arcade machine.
Probably the biggest difference between the Dreamcast and its competitors is the built in 56k modem. This allows Dreamcast owners to log on to the net, surf the web, and fight other opponents head to head. This opens up a HUGE opportunity for finding playmates that until now was restricted to computer gamers. The web surfing ability only sweetens the deal, although like WebTV, there is no ability to download.
It's not for free - ... - but for a household that is currently not on the Internet, the price gets both the web access and unlimited gameplay. You also need to buy a keyboard if you wish to do any web work.
Like the Sony Playstation, the Dreamcast will play audio CDs. Unlike the Playstation 2, it will not play DVDs, however. Also, while the Playstation 2 can play all Playstation games (since both are CD based) the Sega Dreamcast cannot play older Sega games.
Popular Sega games tend to be arcade or fighting games - Rayman 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3. The incredibly high polygon draw rate (three million polygons per second) means that these games fly, giving great gameplay.
Even though this is equipped with a 12x CD player, it's still slower than a cartridge system like the N64. On the up-side, CDs are cheaper than cartridges, and can hold a lot more information on them, leading to more involved games.
I'm personally not a huge Dreamcast fan - the types of games available on it aren't ones that tend to appeal to me - but my arcade and fighting loving friends enjoy it a great deal.
Specifications: CPU: 128-bit RISC Clock Speed: 200 MHz  Sound: CD quality, 64 voices Connector: standard 3-plug video/audio connector 1600 x 1200 resolution Great arcade and fighting appeal, plus internet play!"
4.0	"I will keep this as short as I can.

I am a longtime fan of Fallout. I was not someone who started playing them until Fallout 3, but with the 300+ hours of total gameplay between both Fallout 3 and New Vegas, I can safely say, I was comfortable getting into the new game.

With that being said, I was so happy with my experiences, but also left wanting just a little more.

What I mean - there is sooooo much that I enjoyed about my experience:
+The Story (The best one so far)
+Gameplay Familiarity (its fallout with some tweaks)
+Vast World (big big world to explore)
+Little Discoveries along the way to a quest (A mall run by robots. A town run by robots. A spaceship)
+Sense of purpose (You feel like what you do has value.....though....see minuses)
+Create your own Settlements (Fallout Sims)
+Crafting (I did not do much of this but cool for those that want to do it....It was just semi confusing to me)
+No level Cap (You can literally max out your perks...but there will be a lot of repetition)
+Legendary Enemies (Will drop a cool loot item too that does something special. REALLY cool the first half of game)

After completing the game (Brotherhood Side), I noticed a few things I didn't like:
-I didn't really NEED to craft. I found myself buying better items or more commonly, picking up something amazing off of someone I killed (which could be a positive too)
-Very little instruction or show of benefit with settlements. These can take up a lot of your time if you are into it, but I have yet to discover, other than the feeling like you are doing something that matters, on how it directly helps you. Other that the Artillery fire support you can get later in the game, I failed to find a lot of true value. Though, with that, it was nice to have dumping stations for loot all over the world. :)
-A lot of the quests are procedurally driven...meaning, they will never end. I believe this was done in part because of the lack of a level cap and it gave those trying to get all the perks something to do for EXP other than randomly killing stuff.
-Quest structure - A lot of the quests were very boring. Aka - I need you to go somewhere, kill stuff and come back. This is done in multiple ways but its basically the same idea. Aside from the story based missions, its pretty much the same back and forth over and over same set of stuff. A lot less fun scripted events then I would have expected.
-Graphics are lower than current gen capabilities. It is a hard comparison to something like Black Ops 3, This was expected for the size of the world and the engine being used and I didn't buy it for its cutting age graphics. It looks better than the previous gen offerings for sure. I would love to see this on PC.

Those who have played the original will have some learning to do with how weapons and armor works (you no longer repair identical items...in fact, weapons and armor do not degrade (minus power armor). You end up scarping the items for materials or selling them. This creates a lot more loot on your person that you may not have wanted to carry around longer (in the previous games, ""repair"" was a great way to improve your weapon but also reduce the weight. Otherwise - its Fallout. If you have played the game before, you will enjoy this one.

It sounds like I am really not happy with my experience but that is not true. I just really wanted to explain myself. I have beat the game and have all ready created a new character and replaying it all over again. You don't do that to a game you didn't enjoy. Would I like to have a more true feeling that what I did mattered? Sure. Would I have liked to see a more return on my time invested in my settlements? Oh of course. But if anything, going through it one time gave me additional knowledge that I can take on my next play through. That I can play the game very differently this time around, and I for one am really excited about that. I beat it and all ready created a new file the same day...What does that say?"
4.0	I got the Storybook Workshop for my niece and nephew.  They like to have sleepovers at my house.  They love being read to before bed so I thought they might like this.  They sure did.  The first time they sat down they played for a few hours.  They really love the sing alongs.  I just wish they included more.  They like them, but it gets a little old for the grownups.  They don't make many learning games for children.  I would buy another game for them if another came out. Great for kids
4.0	"I already had HF2 and Episode 1 but figured getting Portal, and Team Fortress 2 in addition to Episode 2 was worth the $40. I was wrong in a good way - it's worth more than $40 and I haven't even tried out TF2 yet.

Episode 2 was a pretty linear extension of Episode 1 but I realized I really missed chopping up the Combine and assorted zombies. There were a few challenges that took some substantial effort to overcome and that made it all the better.

The real surprise was Portal - way fun and made you think. No spoilers here - but one of the talking entities sounded just like my wife when she's talking to the dogs! Now that was creepy.

All I need to do now is gift my old HF2 and Episode 1 to a deserving buddy. Great Value"
4.0	If you're looking for more visual novels for your DS, you should check out Hotel Dusk. It isn't as comical or fun as the Ace Attorney games, but the story is plenty interesting. It's a shame Cing went bankrupt and that the sequel to this game didn't get localized here. Decent Visual Novel
4.0	I don't have much to say for this one. The game works well. Cover & manual look better than expected. The end. Good stuff.
4.0	give for my nephew for doing some chores for me. I don't play, but he enjoys them, Four Stars
4.0	good game but get the complete version Four Stars
4.0	"Finally this game series is transferred over to the most powerful gaming system in the world. Wasn't that the obvious decision from the beginning? Now instead of the characters looking freakishly deformed, you can actually see fine detail. You can see separate fingers instead of the hand mittens that you were subjected to. If you have ever played the PC version then you will notice that the area of the city you can see is bigger. As is such with the Xbox version. The game also supports the higher resolution setting of 720p HDTV, and there will be real time lighting and better looking elements such as rain and smoke. The cars will appear glossy and waxed. There is the custom soundtrack feature where you can play your tunes from your hard drive into the radio of your car (any car with a radio i.e. no cop cars). There is also Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound support so you can hear different pedestrians around you saying ""In the navy"" and other funny phrases. Also gunfire will be of the same effect. Another cool feature is that the button layout is customizable, but i assume that there is a default layout as well. Two awesome games for the price of one."
4.0	hope that it's better than Far cry-3 Four Stars
4.0	"Most games within the racing genre are generally very easy to divide into sub-genres; there's the straight simulation, the action-leaning cartoon / kart racer, and the arcade racer, which lands somewhere in between. Project Gotham Racing 2 is the textbook definition of an arcade racer. It's stuffed full of the physics, modeling, real world location selection and intense competition you'd expect to find in a simulation racer, which results in something of a sim-flavored credibility, but streamlines most of the meticulous, detail-oriented specifics that usually turn off casual gamers and anyone, really, without permanent oil stains on their fingers or a rice burner in the garage. This is a game that excels at delivering the sensation that you're really behind the wheel, with the force of several hundred horses behind your right foot, but also at keeping away from the monotony and mindless repetition that's usually associated with a race of more than one or two laps.

Separating it from straight sims, such as Sony's Gran Turismo titles, is PGR's heavy focus on the acquisition of ""Kudo Points."" The driving force behind each of the two previous chapters in the Project Gotham / Metropolis series, Kudos are gathered through a variety of methods, some common and everyday, others more difficult and unpredictable, and always center on the theme of ""driving stylishly."" In short, you're expected to drive an exciting race every single time you hit the track. While almost every other racer in the history of the industry concentrates exclusively on the clock and the ongoing pursuit of faster laps and more efficient driving, Gotham 2 places a much higher emphasis on showmanship and flashy tricks. You'll gain a flat sum of Kudos for passing an opponent's car or taking a turn properly, but more elaborate maneuvers, such as drifting wildly around a curve or catching some air, reward with higher sums depending on the duration of the trick and your willingness to go on longer and longer stretches without complete control of your vehicle. If you aren't leaving behind a patch of burnt rubber and a cloud of foul-smelling smoke, PGR wants you to think you've done something wrong.

The idea is to shake up the usual formula of ""drive three identical laps and don't let anybody pass you,"" and on the large, it works. Instead of enjoying a track the first few times you drive it, then giving in to brainless replication, you'll find yourself constantly challenged and interested in a course. Actually racing is a lot more fun when you can make the most of your big lead by firing off a few donuts at the finish line or allowing the back end of your car to slide well beyond the point of good reason while taking an easy turn. The key is finding a good middle ground between a dull, straightforward race and an excessively daring, mistake-filled hunt for bigger and better tricks, since most of your opponents' cars are merely looking to win the race and couldn't care less about looking good in doing so.

Actually racing in Gotham is largely very enjoyable, despite a few snags, and though it can make you almost blindingly filled with rage, there's just a certain something that keeps you coming back for more, looking to improve and show the game who's boss in the end. There's a vibe you'll get from controlling one of these cars that's difficult to put into words, something that's perhaps not immediately obvious when it's there but absolutely glaring when it's missing. It's something of a sense of reality, that feeling that you're actually moving as fast as the speedometer says you are, that your car really is as powerful as it claims. It's... well, it's really cool, for lack of a better phrase. When you accelerate in one of Gotham's more thrust-heavy high end machines, you'll feel something pressing down right in the center of your chest... that, and just a tiny bit of adrenaline.

As I hinted, however, the gameplay isn't always wine and roses. There are a few aspects that leave me scratching my head, for instance the decision for the player-controlled car to always, ALWAYS begin the race in last place, without any sort of a qualifying lap or anything. You're always fighting an uphill battle, as you must work your way around the painfully slow cars that start just in front of your position while the speedy pole-sitter gets a chance to create as much distance between himself and your car as possible.

One area in which Gotham 2 really makes its case as a front-running title is the amazing variety of its maps and race tracks. You'll find yourself globe trotting from Moscow to Barcelona to Sydney and back, driving on tracks that vary in length from excessively minute to inexplicably long. Seriously, one course allows the driver to finish four laps in under three minutes, while another demands fifteen minutes of dedication per lap! The environments are incredibly lush and detail heavy, and each course is allowed several different racing layouts, providing endless hours of replay value on courses that look similar at a glance, but are laid out completely differently.

In ""Kudos World Series"" mode, rather than giving players a course, a rundown of opposing cars and a quick ""good luck,"" Gotham shakes up the status quo by not only introducing a few new (and almost universally successful) game types, but by making them an integral part of the single player experience, to boot. As you'll progress through ""World Series"" mode, you'll work your way through a healthy mix of seven different spins on the traditional gameplay model. Each variation seems to emphasize one aspect of becoming a successful driver in the straightforward street races, which remain the bread and butter of individual play, and surprisingly enough, none come across as forced, unnecessary or aggravating.

The multiplayer aspect of the game is a nice addition, if occasionally underdeveloped, but should never be mistaken for the star of the show. The online multiplayer does allow for more than straightforward head-to-head matches, but could have done with a little more thought when all is said and done. The actual system of joining a race online is a tedious, boring affair. You'll find a room with slots available for more racers, find that a race is more than likely already in progress, and then find yourself relegated to observing the remainder of the race from a stale, overhead map with tiny colored squares to indicate the location of each car. There's no fly-by observation mode, or really any kind of visual flair in the slightest. If you have the misfortune of attempting to join an excessively lengthy race just after it's started, your options are either to stare vacantly at the screen for upwards of ten minutes or drop out of the room and look for another race. In short, the multiplayer mode is quite weak and borderline unfinished, which stands in sharp contrast to the polished, beautiful nature of the single player game it accompanies. Very disappointing, and something that brought my opinion of the game down a notch or two.

The amount of work that went into every visual aspect of this game is obvious from the very first moment you boot up. Everything from the menus to the surroundings to, obviously, the vehicles themselves is unspeakably gorgeous. It's a shame the HD output is limited to 480p, because I can't even imagine the kind of impact this would've had at 720p or 1080i. The little touches are what grabbed me the most: they didn't have to include that flock of birds, flying ignorantly over the roads, or that enormous, spindly ferris wheel off in the distance, but they did, and they take unprecedented steps toward furthering the illusion that you're actually there, in person, participating in these races. Nothing about this game's visuals seem forced, even areas that have provided nightmares in other games. The glares and reflections off your car's exterior, which could've very easily been tacky and overdone, seem just right. My sole complaint is that the dynamic lighting is sometimes too realistic, as it occasionally becomes difficult to see where you're going when racing among the long, dark shadows of a dusk-time race. PGR2 is just a gorgeous bit of digitized visual realization, something that set the bar way too high for any competition to even hope to match.

In summary... well, I'll say this in no uncertain terms; this game is a hell of a lot of fun. The controls are simple, easy to comprehend and staggeringly easy to pick up on. The courses, set in landmark cities throughout North America, Europe and Asia, are challenging and varied without completely throwing the player for a loop every time they load a new track. The incline of opposition is steep, progressing upwards from relatively simple-minded Sunday drivers to blood-hungry maniacs who know exactly what they want and precisely how to get it. Even the gameplay, which is largely relegated to simple ""race against the computer or race against your friends"" in other titles, gets a breath of life here, in the form of half a dozen different modes of play. It lacks the fine, fine details of tuning a racing auto to perfection, but seeing as how I'm not all that intrigued by that aspect of the business as it is, I didn't miss those options one bit. If the multiplayer mode had been just a little more well-developed, I'd be giving this one a nearly perfect rating, but as it is right now it's still far above average. This one is definitely worth adding to your collection if you have even the slightest interest in driving a car around a track at insane speeds, and remains one of the most visually stimulating experiences I've enjoyed in gaming. The Best Racer on the Old Xbox"
4.0	Nice... not as good as most wanted or carbon, but still entertaining.  Story line, graphix, and video shoots were best of the line of N4S games, but game play and difficulty was sub-par.  The cops were a joke in this game... very ez to evade and the cpu competition was also a joke. Nice
4.0	We as well don't have any kids in our household and we really enjoy this game. The best aspect of it in my opinion is the table tennis, it's challenging and fun and gets your motor going. we actually get sore after it. i still haven't mastered most of the games in this game, can't get the hang of the swimming at all. the Trampoline is fun. And the main thing i like about this is that this game has a POINT!!! I don't like games where you just compete, win and do it again. Here you actually have to beat all the different games w/ different characters in order to unlock more games and characters. I still have yet to unlock anything (only played a few times). But the graphics are great (mario and sonic are always fun). controls for the most part are very good and sensitive. the reason I gave this 4 stars is because I would have liked to see a few more challenges that actually resemble olympics, like snow related (skiiing, skating, etc) and a few more things. that's why I order the Winter Games game! =) FUN & Enjoyable for all ages
4.0	Awesome game! Beat it pretty quickly though, but it was fun!! Four Stars
4.0	PS3.  I got stuck on a level where all of the paintings were supposed to show up.  I even followed a tutorial and help online to get passed this glitch, didn't work, and I did everything I was supposed to.  Possible glitch??  Besides that the game is great.  Just too bad I never got to finish it. Stuck
4.0	"Pretty much perfect in almost every way. I got to using the controls quickly and nicely, after a button re-map, and it feels comparable to how Brawl was.

The game feels much more balanced at first, and I appreciate the much-needed buffs to picks like Ganon and Jigglypuff (Her Sing actually disables!).

I appreciate the lack of chain-grabs, no tripping and the overall smooth flow of the game. Graphics look stunning and they're very polished.

Wifi works wonderful with my friend 1200miles away, with minimal lag

I have to give 4, because the battery dies very quickly (Could be an option for low-quality). Smash Run isn't online. It's VERY awkward without a C-Stick (Couldn't they implement the C-stick in the touchscreen, swipe <^>V). Pretty much perfect in almost every way"
4.0	"It's a DS charger.  It charged the DS.

Long cord...  I don't know what else to say about it.

It works. Works"
4.0	"You can't have a Rock Band with only one guitar.  Pick up a second axe, and double your fun.  This opens up some multiplayer options like guitar duel.  It lost a star because there's a ""springy"" noise inside the case (probably the tilt sensor for overdrive). Totally Necessary"
4.0	I had never played the original game before.  I enjoyed this game so much!  It's a fun idea, the puppets, the places, the story, etc...  I would have been happier had the extra content had been included.  I seriously hope that they publish the sequel on the DS soon! I really loved this game!
4.0	"I purchased this game almost as an afterthought, and was very impressed with how much fun it is. While the production values aren't stellar, the actual ""meat"" of the game is very well done. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this game more than Robotech: Battlecry. Handling your mech is certainly a less cumbersome task, and the graphics (while not mindblowing) are rather good. Every mission is filled with a sense of urgency, as you must zip from location to location rather quickly in order to meet all of the mission goals. My favorite aspect of the game is it's controls. When one thinks of a mech game, a series of complicated controls come to mind. Not here. I jumped right into the game, and was flying around launching airstrikes and transforming for ground assaults in no time at all. It's not the ultimate mech game, but for the price, it certainly offers a fun (if somewhat short) ride. Surprisingly Good"
4.0	This was a really good game for like the first couple of hours.  Then it was all repetitave you kill the same people over and over again.  Plus if you don't level up enough you can get stuck just like I did I had to start all over again I started to play like 5 min then turned it off.  Something that was pretty good about it was that it was turn base fighting.  But it is a pretty good game but should have more varitey in the game. Good game got kind of boring!
4.0	The game as played by my son has an entire story line to it with many characters and places, lots of imagination.  He talks about it often, and put aside other games just to play this one, so it must be good.  Received product quickly and in good condition. loads of fun
4.0	If your a big fan of cut and slash then this is the game for you, the game includes a good character building system and is very ally/enemy interactive. At the start of the game you are allowed to choose from five different characters of the usual scource(barbarian, necromancer, rogue, scorcerer, cleric. Whats also great about this game is you can also go online if you have the connection and you don't have to share screens with other players. The graphics are more advanced than previous cut& slash such as baldurs gate, shows some awesome spell effects, main downside to the game is i think they could have made it a little longer, i guess it made up for that with the three different vehicle levels which you can start from the beginning in with the same characters. I think you will enjoy it........worth buying. A good rpg
4.0	Nothing could ever hold up to the original Super Mario Brothers, but this game gives it a good shot and mostly hits the mark! I think Mario is my uncle.
4.0	My first amiibo's ever and a testament to how greatly addictive splatoon is! Four Stars
4.0	Placed on Red 3DSXL. It's fallen from my purse/tables/beds many times and has taken no damage. Scuffs easily and can get somewhat sticky, but you can clean all that off just as easily with neutral dish soap and water. Snaps in firmly and doesn't come off easily. fits perfectly, camera is not obstructed. Makes holding the DS also a little easier on large hands like mine. Good stuff.
4.0	"I always have been a fanatic of driven racing games. Nevertheless, there have been some great games that have really stood out that testament to all racers like Mario Kart for Nintendo, and the sleek and exciting Gran Turismo series for the Playstation 2 system, and the high speed Project Gotham Racing games for the Xbox systems. As for Electronic Arts, the company that has been known for the drama of the highly acclaimed Madden football series, they have definitely known that with the Need For Speed franchise for several systems and computers. Now, that has taken a turn to being most wanted for all gamers.

Need For Speed: Most Wanted for the Playstation 2, is a wild fast and eciting thrill ride, as you goal is to become the number one villain of the underworld of racing. The game here is more like a hybrid cross, bringing the gameplay from the Underground series, while trying to add the element for racers, who were fans of Need For Speed's Hot Pursuit series a few years ago. The game includes several challenges from career mode, which is where you can earn points, and unlock the baddest of automobiles from current classics like the Chevy Cobalt coupe and the Ford Mustang, to exotica with maddening street credibilty like the Ford GT, the Subaru Impreza WRX, and the Lambourghini to the mix as well. The graphics and sound really do stand out well, and bring each element out of the gameplay, while the control is very simple and easy to maintain for all racers alike. The game also includes classics like Circuit, Lap Knockout and Point To Point races, which have been recognized for all classic Need For Speed fans, as well as new gameplays like Toll Booth knockout, which is where you can try going through as many tool booths along the racetrack within the time limit.

All in all, Need For Speed: Most Wanted is a great game for die hard fans of both the Underground series, and a welcome return for anybody who enjoyed the hot pursuit days too. While I honestly wish that this could've had more locations rather than one big area to play in, it still remains a whole lot of fun. I love this driven game, and for anybody who has the Playstation 2, you'll like this fast & furious speed.

4.0	Good game.  I noticed the kids don't play with this as much as they used to with our older versions.  Maybe it's because we have so many versions in this series. Good game. I noticed the kids don't play with ...
4.0	"First off, this game is better then the first version... The new characters are great, and play out pretty good for the most part, new skin, stages, and moves makes it feel fresher too. The game definitely received a harder difficulty too, in the first one, i beat arcade on very hard (the hardest setting) and had to continue maybe twice, in this one, i cant even get halfway to the boss, without continuing like ten times.

So yeah definitely harder. If your a Marvel fan, and a Street fighter/ capcom fan, and enjoy fighting games, this game is great. Online you will get tore up, as mainly the elite players are the ones that made the jump into UMvC3, so be prepared to put a lot of time into practicing. Good but..."
4.0	My son, who is 11, enjoys this game. He plays it often and has mentioned it's a favorite. Fun game
4.0	It is a good game I play it for days super fun. good game
4.0	game play it a bit shabby but it maintains the mortal kombat excitement .. new moves take some gettin used to (as expected) and the combos could be better ... worth a buy for the mk fanatic mk vs dc
4.0	I bought this game because me and boyfriend love Mario anything. For the most part the game is really fun and although there is no exact two player I still really like it. It's different. I wish you didn't have to use the nunchuck but the game is fun, entertaining, and the graphics don't look bad at all for wii! fun game
4.0	"I have to get this off my chest first finally a Simpsons game that isn't BAD.  I have to admit though the first time I put the game in to play I though it might sucks but it doesn't.  This is like a non violent version of GTA without the blood or a heavy use of swearing but you use the Simpsons chracters in place of a nameless hood.  I haven't played the game for too long (I am on the stages that use Bart.) but here are some pros and cons
PROS
Great graphics and sound I was worried about the use of 3-D graphic how wrong I was they look great
Good story and plenty of hilarious quotes from the various characthers that make up the town of Springfeild.
various unlockables
CONS
Camera om som missions the camera can just be SO unforgiving at certain tomes
You might find yourself re-starting missions as some of them are tough
For me the pros outweigh the cons and I bought it on sale so I am happy with this simpsons game.  I highly recommend this for fans of the show and as a rental for others (maybe after you've rented it you might buy it.)  On a final word They finally got it right after all these years someone delivers the goods for a GREAT Simpsons. GTA -- SIMPSONS STYLE"
4.0	"Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is the sequel to a game entitled ""The Longest Journey"" for the PC.  I'm ashamed to say I've yet to play this remarkable game, but when the sequel came around, I couldn't say no to it.  In fact, because of its sequel I want the first one even more.  This game has deep, interesting and convincing characters, along with a fantastic storyline.  The game is, overall, a fantastic experience.

Zoe is a beautiful attractive woman who can't decide what she wants to do with her life anymore.  She's dropped out of high school, she's broken up with her longtime boyfriend, and now she seems completely and utterly lost.  Her ex boyfriend, however, is interested in doing a story, and he needs Zoe's help.  This begins what is undeniably a fantastic game, full of fantastic story elements.  It seems simple, but the story grows into something remarkably complex.  It becomes somewhat of a fantastic journey the player never wants to end.  There are moments, however, where the story throws a lot at you, and the game isn't long enough to bring every subplot to a satisfactory conclusion.  This shouldn't suggest the storyline is bad.  You'll just expect the game to be longer.

The story is played out through cinematic cutscenes.  Most of the story is told in this fashion.  However, unlike most games, the voice acting is top notch.  It never losses hold.  The dialogue is also fantastic, and flows smoothly.  Put simple, these characters actually seem human as opposed to one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs.  Not only does this help the characters seem human, but also helps them become instantly likeable. You'll also be given choices to make in some dialogue sequences.  Your choice makes the outcome of some dialogue a little different, but you'll still end up in the same place regardless of your choice.

Dreamfall plays like an Action/Adventure game.  Battling foes is pretty simple.  It's not hard at all.  The game is not much of a challenge, and even some puzzles are pretty simplistic.  Despite how little of a challenge the game is, that shouldn't suggest the gameplay doesn't have its merits. There are some puzzles that really will boggle your mind.  It's even better because there is no one basic solution to a puzzle.  Several of the games puzzles are, in fact, open ended.  Put simple, there's more than one way to solve various puzzles in the game.  This works for replay value as well.  If a puzzle is easy the first time, try to solve it in a more challenging and intellectual way the next time.  It makes doing many of the games puzzles rather fun and interesting as opposed to being stale and repetative like some games out there.  The only real problem with the gameplay is that there's not a whole lot of it.  Most of the game consists of dialogue and exploring.  So you won't fight that many enemies, or solve nearly as many puzzles as you might think.  Rather, you'll be watching more of the game than actually playing it, and this is something that has plagued video games for a while now.

It's fun to explore many of the games areas.  Especially considering it looks visually stunning.  You won't just play as Zoe either, and each character has different reactions to certain things.  So you might also want to go and explore the same area as another character.  The game also isn't so huge that you'll get lost while exploring, which helps the game in more ways than one. And because the game is so beautiful, you can easily get lost in it.  It really does look like a fantastic world.  Especially because the characters also seem so real.  They've got facial expressions and everything, making them seem a lot less like stone statues.

Even better is the audio.  Video Games rarely sound as good as Dreamfall.  The music is, in and of itself, dreamlike because it's so good.  If the graphics don't absorb you into the world, the soundtrack sure as hell will.  It's expertly composed, almost movielike in when the music starts as well.  And, as I've noted, the voice acting is astonishing.  Also close to being movie like.  Perhaps some of the best voice talent in the entire video game industry, and I'm not overexaggerating.

The game is a little short, though, despite its long cutscenes.  The game can easily be completed in less than ten hours if you try.  However, with such an absorbing storyline (that does, I'm sorry to say, end too soon), it'll fly by.  You'll have the game completed befre you know it.  I really wish the game could've been longer.

You'll love Dreamfall.  So many elements and themes woven into one game can't be bad.  It's a fantastic gaming experience, one that so rarely comes about in the gaming world.  Nearly everything about this game shines.

On the Positive Side
+Fantastic Graphics
+Some of the best music in gaming history
+A very involving and interesting storyline
+Lots of exploration to be done
+Great voice acting and dialogue
+Loveable characters

But on the bad side...
-There are a lot of subplots, not all of which, conclude in a satisfactory way
-The game is short
-Many moments of watching rather than playing
-The game isn't that challenging

Despite some of the cons, the game is fantastic and engaging experience. Maybe It was Just a Dream... A Long Beautiful Dream"
4.0	When i frist seen this game i hesitated because the lack of a good rpg for ps2 but when i poped this game in it was a new experience the enviroment for this game is like no other rpg its like playing resident evil or slient hill in rpg form it dark and spooky unlike most bright and colorful rpg where used to. the graphics on this game are great it only falls short to one game final fantasy X it has great CG. the gameplay is fresh with a new battle system where you have this wheel every time youu attack use magic or items what you have to do is time you button pushes at a certin time on the wheel to execute a moer powerful attack so no more just pushing the button and watching what happens this system makes you feel a more a part of the game. the story seems great a cant maketo much of a comment since i haven't cleard the game yet an i don't want to spoil anything. all in all this is the second best rpg on ps2 behind ff10 and should at least be rented if not purchesed ill give it a 4 cuz it still need some work to be a true classic. A different kind of RPG
4.0	I really enjoyed this game.  Great characters, story, world, graphics*, gameplay*, etc.  I played this game through the first time on Xbox 360.  Was not that great due to game breaking graphics and gameplay issue.  Characters would not load so you saw only floating spells, meshes clipping in background scenery, sound not loading, freezing, frame rate dips, etc.  I think the game was too much for the XBox 360 or Bioware did a halfhearted job of QCing the older platform versions.  On the Xbox One, the graphics were great, had no freezing, had no freamerate dips, and no loading issues.  Was much easier to get sucked into the game the second time around.  I loved it much more and was sad when it was done.  I will say that the Trespasser DLC seemed like the true ending to the game.  It should have been part of the original game instead of behind a pay wall.  The other DLC was not critical to the game's canon and I have no problem with it being DLC. Wonderful Game
4.0	"I'm new to retro game collecting, and I bought this used Paperboy cartridge two weeks ago. When I tried putting it in my NES (toaster), it wouldn't fit in the slot at all. It messed up three of the pins too! So I ended up with vertical white lines on every game I play.

So since I couldn't fix my connector, I ordered these. I'm glad I ordered two because one of them doesn't fit with the tray (or whatever you call it that houses the cartridge when you put it in).

I'm keeping the one that doesn't fit as a tester before putting a new cart in my NES, though. Overall, I would buy these again if my NES decides to not work 100% again, but all of my games boot up without a hassle anymore.

Note: I noticed the recurring mention in the reviews that games are harder to pull out with this connector. I do notice a certain tightness, but not anything alarming. I think a tight connection is better anyway than having a looser one that doesn't consistently boot up a game right away.

Second note: I clean ALL of my cartridges with pink eraser and 91% isopropyl alcohol. From the previous reviews, I also checked to make sure the connectors weren't damaged, and they were both fine (except one of them doesn't fit with my tray, of course). My NES lives... AGAIN! One con, though."
4.0	Very fun but find myself missing the action when typing things and then looking up at screen from game pad. Very good game
4.0	"OK, so Call of Duty has been reduced to a parody of itself, and there are certainly better shooters out there. But on the Wii U, Black Ops 2 and Ghosts seem to be two of the very few FPS options. That being said, I was surprised to find that Ghosts on the Wii U was strangely competent. There are only about 500-600 players online at any given time, mostly in Team Deathmatch. However Ive never had a problem finding a game, and because there aren't as many people playing online compared to the ones Ive played on Xbox there are fewer dropped games and lag. Truth be told, I haven't played the single player campaign yet and I probably never will because hey, its CoD, you know the story is forgettable. But if you need an inexpensive FPS fix, this is the version to get.

Pros:
- Fast action
- Much more tolerable online competitors
- Lots of gun and perk options
- Inexpensive
- Many different controller options

Cons:
- Some online game modes are empty
- Only one DLC map, Freefall (though it is free)
- Why bother even including a story mode?
- Some of the maps are too big for 8 vs. 8 matches. Youll spend a lot of time just running around looking for people to shoot Better Than You'd Expect From a CoD Game"
4.0	"Everyone complains how great or how bad this game was. To me when it first came out I loved it, it was the first Final Fantasy game I played i was like 9 or 10 years old. I still like the game a lot yes now it has bad graphics but they were cool back then. The story was good but at times made you laugh. Cloud was alright but there has been better but I thought sephiroth was a great bad guy and to me the best character in the game. Yes it is long but I enjoy games that take time to beat and it wasn't very difficult to beat. I enjoyed that there was a lot of extra stuff to do in the game besides the main storyline which is smoething games are missing these days.

All in all I still enojy playing this game as most of the other Final Fantasy's, my favorite is 9 to be honest. They all have good and bad things about them. So it's not my favorite game but its still one of them. Final fantasy 7"
4.0	"First off, I just started the game today and have yet to finish it so this is really a preliminary review. So far I am really enjoying the game, it is a fun, silly and very juvenile romp making fun of the early sci-fi B movies. It is also a political satire poking fun at cold war America. However, the T for teen rating is very misleading. Depending an the age and maturity of your teen parents may want to think twice about purchasing this game. Characters use strong language, such as ""ass"" when referring to others and some of the themes may be inappropriate. Characters make numerous sexual references, some female characters exclaim ""hurry up boys, my biological clock is ticking,"" ""I'm going commando"" (referring to a lack of underwear) and characters of both genders intimate homosexual / lesbian tendencies. Additionally, the player has a weapon called an ""anal probe."" Ultimately, I am enjoying this game but I am an adult, parents should be aware of this rather mature content prior to purchasing this game. Bottom line, this game should have an M rating instead of a T rating. Adult Fun"
4.0	"I played as single player and found the beginning fairly challenging at the mid-toughness level. As game progressed outside of the main story, it became fairly routine. Shoot somebody and somebody says ""Hey What-the"" all the time.
I like the sniper rifle mostly from a distance.
Achieved all the special abilities available fairly easily by the end. Side quests were mostly simple run around or shoot some outside group and knife their leader.
I didn't lke the main story's dream fight sequences where all you need to do is click buttons in sequence as they appear on screen. Replay if you die, over and over.
Also, saving the game to a server never puts you back to exactly where you left the game. A little confusing at first.
I enjoyed this game.... it wasn't long game play, some things were out of your control but overall it was fun. Can't wait for the next one. Lots of Fun -"
4.0	"Ok I'll cut right to the chase and address some of the gripes people seem to be having about this game, then give my review.

1)The missions are too repetetive??: Ok people, you're a NINJA and you KILL people or gather intelligence. BUT, no matter what the primary objective is... you are going to have to kill lots of people! What is wrong with that? What kind of missions do YOU people think should be in here? Maybe a gathering firewood mission or steal money to give to the poor?

2)The AI sucks?? Ok, the AI might not be the greatest (like MOST games) but you have to put the time factor into perspective. In REAL life, if a guard sees you and you run, you'd stay gone for an hour or a day or week, THEN come back to complete the mission. Obviously the developers were smart in realizing people want things not quite that realistic so they sped things up a bit to where the guards forget about you after a minute or so. I see no problem with that, under the circumstances.

So, my review is very positive. I've only done the first mission so far, BUT I've done it like four times and done things differently EVERY time. That is the magic of this game. There are so many options open to you. You can hide in bushes, water, on top of buildings, UNDER buildings, and you can constantly buy new equipment and items to help you out on missions. It's a very welcome step to the game and makes you feel like your ""building"" your ninja more.

True, the combat aspect of the game is a little stale by modern standards, but of course this is a stealth game, so its not all that surprising that they don't focus so much on that. If I had one real wish for improvement, though, I guess that would be it.

Make NO mistake: This game is FUN and you feel like a ninja, like you're really in the thick of enemy territory. I found myself holding my breathe more than a few times. The improved stealth-kill system is awesome, even including multiple kills.

If you are a true fan of the series, pick up the game, no question. You won't be sorry. Fun to be a Ninja!"
4.0	Great mouse no problems so far and VERY comfortable. Four Stars
4.0	Great case. Very big FYI. Great Case
4.0	"I admit that I've been ignoring First Light for several months. I've never been into DLC because by the time I'm done with the main story; I'm ready to move on to something completely different. Heck, the only reason I downloaded the game is because it was one of the free games offered over the sunmer, and I figured I'd save it for a rainy day. Well, thanks to Uncharted 4 and Mighty No 9 being pushed back (yet again) that rainy day arrived.

Combat:
This is no different than any of the other infamous games, meaning; there's a balanced mix of melee and 3rd person shooter. I probably relied on hand to hand combat 75% of the time, mainly because it's fun. The melee combat is pretty basic, and there are not many combos (if any). I'm just fine with that because sometimes less is more. Staying true to the franchise, there's no blocking or dodging because those mechanics are unnecessary in this game. If an enemy is getting the best of you, simply use her neon dash to get away and your health will replenish on its own.

Weaponry:
If you've played Second Son, you should be familiar with Fetch's neon power that Delsin 'borrowed'. I didn't enjoy it while using Delsin, but I had a blast playing as Fetch. Unlike Delsin's main power (smoke), I felt like I got more bang for my buck with Fetch's neon, and I'll explain what I mean. I was able to do a ton of damage without using up much ammo. Not once did I run out of neon ammo, and that's a rare occurrence in an infamous game. Later on, I unlocked neon missiles, but I rarely used them. My favorite 'weapon' was the area attack that needed to be built up over time. Once unleashed, that was all she wrote :-)

Enemies:
I'm a bit disappointed with the enemies, hence the 4 out of 5 rating. The D.U.P. and Akuran gang members were to be expected. What I didn't expect was the absence of a boss battle. I'm assuming other DLCs may not include boss battles, but that's unacceptable for an action game; DLC or not. I kept waiting for a boss battle, but it never happened. I would have settled for a mini boss battle, but nope...

Miscellaneous:
The sidemissions are top notch, and easily the best aspect of the game. If you enjoy challenge maps (I don't), you'll feel right at home, because there are plenty of them. If you own Second Son, you'll even get to use Delsin in some of the challenge maps. I'm not complaining about the 5 hour campaign because I expected that from a DLC.

I enjoyed First Light more than I thought I would, and Abigail 'Fetch' Walker more than held her own as the leading lady. If you're interested, just accept it for what it is, which is a DLC; and you'll be fine. Limbo; you're up next! My first DLC experience"
4.0	"Great product, I've been using it for months now. Only thing I wish was different was how deep the earpieces were. My left ear hits the inside of the headset once in awhile, and it's not like I have Dumbo ears or anything.

UPDATE:
I've had this headset for about 2 yrs now.
Headset still going strong, I've used this headset a lot, and still no physical wear on them. Mic still works fine, I always retract the mic whenever I'm done with the headset so no problems with it breaking. Speakers still work just as good as the first day I got this. I still wish the ear cups were a little deeper, my left ear still hits the inside of it, could just have been a manufacturer defect since my right ear doesn't have that problem.

The mic on/off switch doesn't seem to be working anymore, and my mic is always on now so I can only mute myself by unplugging the mic connection. The adjustable volume control had deteriorated a little, at low settings sometimes sound will only come out of one ear piece so I need to slightly adjust the control until sound comes out of both ear pieces.
I've noticed that my ear get hot after prolonged use. The leather material used isn't breathable so the area around my ears would start to perspire.

Overall I am happy with the product, it's lasted me 2 years and counting. I will be making sure the next headset I purchase has deeper pockets for the ears, if it wasn't for that issue I would have given this product a 5 star. 2 year update"
4.0	Take a break from reality and try not to hold your breath. Better than it's sequel. First person hysteria
4.0	This is definitely one of the better WW II first person shooters I've played (and I've played pretty much all of them). I wasn't crazy about all the video scenes, and I still don't think I understand the convoluted story line, but the gameplay itself was a lot of fun. Plus, it took me a lot longer to complete the single-player missions than a lot of other games have. It's nice to see a software developer actually put that much effort into the single-player component rather than focusing mainly on the multiplayer component. So, in a nutshell, I definitely recommend this game to avid WW II first person shooter addicts. Very good game - Lots of fun
4.0	"This is the only true expansion pack of the Guild Wars series, in that it doesn't stand alone -- you need to have at least one of the three ""campaigns"" (Prophecies, Factions, or Nightfall) in order to play it.

Eye of the North adds a large map area filled with high-level monsters, challenging dungeons, and a number of quests.  Of course, there are new skills and titles to acquire, too, along with a number of new heroes (the NPC allies first developed in Nightfall).

The story, about an ancient menace from the depths, felt a little weaker than the main games' storylines, but it's serviceable.  Unfortunately, it's also rather short compared to any of the campaigns.  It's pretty quick to complete (if you can deal with the difficulty).  The numerous dungeons add a bit more play time, though.

Considering there's no subscription fee, it's a pretty reasonable amount of new content for the price -- but I'd get the base campaigns first. A good expansion pack, but a little short"
4.0	good game Four Stars
4.0	"The Aion Collector's Edition has been a pleasant, if not completely original experience.  Opening the box revealed some nice trinkets (e.g. a figurine and some maps), but it contained nothing I simply couldn't live without.  Because I preordered I was able to partake in the closed and open betas.  Having done so, I got a good feel for the character customization and PvE elements.  Since launch, I've found the action to be pretty typical for an MMORPG.

If you've played World of Warcraft, chances are you're already pretty familiar with what goes on in Aion.  I've also played Tabula Rasa and Guild Wars.  Aion just doesn't have much on any other MMO.  The only things that distinguish it from the others is the fantastic graphics and limited flight ability.  That's about it.  I must say that the time I've spent on Aion has been fun.  I've enjoyed the cut scenes, quests, and story line.  The character customization has also been one of the best I've seen.

Unfortunately, Aion has experienced all kinds of lag and gold spammers and bots.  It's more annoying than crippling, so I tolerate it.  That's not really a deal breaker for me.  I've had success with logging on and staying logged on, so the game is pretty stable.  Only some mild glitches here and there will cause the image to stutter.  Again, not a deal breaker.

I really like the back story.  The Elyos and Asmodians are both rich in heritage and culture.  Personally, I prefer the Asmodians.  They're a tortured, dark race filled with resentment and anger.  Their eyes glow red during combat.  Creepy.

My advice is if you're getting sick of WoW, you might try Aion.  It's nothing earth-shattering.  I wouldn't bother with the Collector's Edition unless you really like figurines.  That's probably the most interesting part of this edition. Aion Takes Flight"
4.0	This game is really fun when it comes down to doing side content & exploration. But of course I feel as though the story is not there in terms of narrative & down right justice to warrant a 10 year wait. So this game is still worth buying for first time FF players & hardcore fans. An incomplete masterpiece
4.0	Cool game Four Stars
4.0	I think that the case is a tight fit on the 3DS XL, in a good way. Although, I have only put it on once; I did not want to risk cracking it by taking it off and putting it back on for any reason. Fits Great!
4.0	I've not used it a ton, but it has done what I needed. Wish it has rechargeable. Four Stars
4.0	Loved the game. Enjoyed it almost as much as the first. It was neat playing as a Big Daddy, but I hated having to escort the Little Sisters around. I ended up just harvesting them right away. Other than that, I enjoyed the story and gameplay Great game - Almost as good as the first
4.0	"This is a game based in a very large world after a nuclear war had occured 200 years prior. The environment alone is eerie yet beautiful, harsh and yet somehow kind: a truly perfect balance of good and bad with ugly and beautiful. Aside from appearances, this game reminds me very much of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in that it is a fantasy (nightmare fantasy) where instead of beautiful trees and grass and sunsets with nasty monsters, we have the exact opposite in that everything is ugly but there are memorable characters to brighten the ""ugliness"" of this post-nuclear world. This is a shooter adventure role-playing game all wrapped in one great world to explore and even destroy. The leveling system is excellent and doesn't take forever to see results and yet the A.I. keeps up with you so it is not easy. Challenging yet rewarding for those who love challenege and for those who have not experienced a game like this. For anyone who enjoys shooters and fantasy role-playing games, this game combines the two very effectively creating a world that is truly worth playing several times. Fallout 3 Review!!!"
4.0	"The Jak and Daxter series is amazing. People argue that the second one is the best and I agree, but they are all very good. This one is also good, just naughty dog decided to go in a different flow. They decided to go with racing, combat racing that is. I thought this was a great choice because people who are getting bored with the action/adventure Jak's they can play this one which is a totally different flow, but with the same theme.

  Now the Jak and Daxter series is known well for its great fantasy story-line. They didn't do too bad with this one, but I already knew the story-line wasn't going to be as good as th last ones because its hard to come up with a good story-line for racing games. You're Jak as always and combat racing has become the most popular sport in the Jak world. Before Krew died he made a bet with an amazing racing team meanwhile Krew had nobody to represent his team. So after Jak won the world race in Jak 2 he made a poison that he would give him and all his friends so that they would be forced to race for him if they wanted the antidote. As you probably know, Krew died in the second game so he was not able to give Jak and his friends the antidote himself so he got his daughter to do it. Now you must race as Jak to save your life by winning the championship.

  The gameplay is great. The thing that makes it so great is that its not just racing its combat racing. So you get to shoot your opponents with various weapons oyu pick up throughout the race. The game has all different kinds of races that you compete in. It has the circuit race, turbo races, time limit races, demolitino derby and more. This lets you not get the feeling of being bored, the only problem i have with all this different kinds of races is that you don't see as much circuit races as i would have liked to see. Another problem with the racing is that the tracks are not made too well. What i mean by this is that many turns are way too sharp and most of the sharp turns come after a jump so you end up going up the jump and not being able to turn in the air so you crash into the wall in mid air. Also your vehicle flips over a lot which gets annoying. Probly the level that has the most of this is haven city, in the sewers. The controls are great and easy to get into. And a cool thing about killing someone or when your car blows up is that everything goes into slow motion and it shows the car totally get destroyed and crash into the wall and do flips and stuff. And once you blow up your not eliminated, you just start over from where you blew up and they have your car moving already so its not like oyu have to wate for acceleration. The car doesnt have that many cars, only like 12 or so, but the game lets you customize your vehicles which is great. Throughout the game you win new parts like body, wheels, front pannels and sidepannels and what not. Its great. The game also has multiplayer, only i wish you could do more than just two players. But you can unlock new characters by having your memory card in with the previous jak games saved data on it. You can get characters like thee first jak and second jak. The game also has online play where you can join clans and stuff.

  The graphics are decent, just like the last jak game. Really no improvments which sucks, but in this one there really isn't much of cut-scenes. I would have liked to see more cut-scenes because i love the characters in the Jak world. The sound is also good with the machine guns and rockets, they sound great.

  This game is excellent, not quite as good as the previous ones but it gives Jak a new flow. I would really like to see an new one and you should defenitely pick this one up especially if you liked the jak series. The game is rated Teen for: Crude Humor, Fantasy Violence, Language, Use of Tobacco. Lets Jak things up!"
4.0	I bought it and send as a gift to my brother. Four Stars
4.0	Very big game, you can play it forever. Turn-based tactics for which the ds is perfect. You can also play online thanks to the 3ds support for wpa wifi instead of the old WEP that is supported nowhere anymore. You can watch FE videos online to get an idea, no need to go into that here. For the long unempolyed.
4.0	"It's been awhile since I honestly enjoyed playing CoD.  The past few games I often found myself buying and playing the games for the sake of playing with other friends who will obsessively play the latest iteration for months.

CoD AW was a pleasant surprise.  On Day Zero I decided to play it sans friends to really take a critical look at the overall feel and pacing of the game.  The campaign was challenging and the story was fairly interesting, if not all that original.  The graphics and lighting effects were amazing.  It really feels like a true next-gen experience.

But for me the multiplayer was a nice surprise.  The addition of the exosuits was a big shift in terms of multiplayer strategy.  In some ways having skills like boost jumping really added a new dimension to the game.  Also by keeping the weapons modern (and in some cases, futuristic) but relatively contemporary really keeps the game from slipping into Halo or Titanfall territory.  The change was just enough to add a new spin on a (somewhat) tired formula, but not go completely off the reservation.  Even the current MP maps are for the most part, well-designed to accommodate the new additions to the CoD formula.

My only gripe (so far) was how some of the maps seem a bit ill-suited to take advantage of the new gaming mechanics.  Also, in a lot of cases, camping still remains a solid strategy.  It's also nice to see subtle improvements to the perks and other tried and true parts of the CoD experience.

On day one I had some issues with logging on to the server.  However, after rebooting the game a few times I was able to get on and never had a problem.  During my 5 hours of play, I never experienced any lag and the servers seemed to be able to support the initial flood of players.  We'll see how it holds up as more people in the first few weeks (and through the holidays) join the servers.  I played primarily Ground War to test the limits and didn't run into any real issues.

I'm glad this game sort of rekindled my interest in the CoD franchise.  For a few years I was really getting worried about how stagnant the gameplay, mechanics and even the maps were getting. Fun CoD Experience"
4.0	"Just got this Bundle today.
Game is awesome as expected.
Price was nice for the increase in space from my 120 GB Slim Model, however when I pulled out the new system (Super Slim model) from it's box... HEARTBROKEN.
WTH is this junk??

Now, don't get me wrong... so far it is working fine... BUT it feels so cheap and trashy.
I spent this money expecting quality electronics... a real deal, but no you certainly get what you pay for.
Please note that my complaints may seem purely about aesthetics, but I am really concerned about durability and functionality.

It is way too light and the disc input area is a slider which exposes the entire inside at the top... great way to get lots of dust and exposure to the elements...YAY :/

It feels like cheap toy plastic and hollow, not solid at all. You can hear rattling when you place it down on a surface due to the slider.

The placement of the slider makes it annoying if you have an entertainment area that relies on front loading media players.
If you place it vertical, you have to make sure there is space on the left of it.)

The only thing preventing me from returning this is the 500GB it offers which I needed to have.
So if you do not mind paying $300 for 500 GB and Assassin's Creed III, then this is an awesome choice.
If you were expecting a well structured and sturdy PS3 with this purchase, please lower your expectations as you will be highly disappointed.

UPDATE 6/20/13 : System is in tip top shape. I still find the top loader frustrating (especially the way my entertainment area is setup- system is on a narrow shelf.) I am VERY satisfied with this purchase overall, but would never travel with this system. I still think it is more prone to damage than the older model. Game, Bundle, and Price is great idea, but the Super Slim Model is NOT."
4.0	This game is very unforgiving on time. You have to micromanage everything you're doing and RUN there while doing it. You pretty much need some type of guide or you will fail since you don't have time to look around for things. That takes away some fun from the game. The story is also a lot of nonsense compared to the first two. I spent more time with my head down in the guide book than I did watching and enjoying the game. I can't really imagine any fun replaying this because of all the chores you have in it. It's a must buy for fans but I wish they made it more like the other two games. For fans only...
4.0	"Game is still not here and now I found out there is no offline horde so another step backwards. I can't even play split screen horde! Maybe I'm doing something wrong, idk, very disappointed

edit:I had to restart my xbox to get it to connect to xbox live and was able to get split screen horde. Still disappointed that I need to pay for gold and cant play it offline. GOW 3 was better"
4.0	Muy interesante Four Stars
4.0	I own both the PC and Xbox version of these games and still have to give the nod to the PC.  The console graphics just aren't up to par for the PC and the movement/building of rides is just way too cumbersom on the Xbox.  You can easily have 4 or 5 different windows open trying to build a simple ride.  The PC version just comes off as smoother.  However, it is still a fantastic game on either. Good port to the console, but the PC version is still better
4.0	It's a cool game,the graphics are pretty good and it's fairly fun,but I don't enjoy being in a jet the whole game,a few levels on the ground would be nice or in a tank,the monotiny just gets to me. Overall a pretty cool game,wouldn't pay 35 dollars for it but a cool game. I enjoyed it for a while but I didn't end up even finishing the whole game yet. 3.5 stars.
4.0	Duke Nukem 64 isn't a bad game. In fact, it could be one of the best on N64. I don't know. I haven't played much shooters on N64. But, I do own this and chaotic DM with 2 freinds and a bot couldn't get better. Quake 64 and Doom 64 can't offer this much fun. THis is essentially a port of the pc game, but with new levels and add-ons to existing levels. I recomend this game. Come get some 64
4.0	Can be a little glitchy but works and your hands don't cramp. Good for big hands

4.0	"These days, everyone has a video game system that has a internet connection. Although it seems to be a must right now, it is very difficult match for those who don't have the wireless connection to the high-speed internet highway, Nintendo has now made it more exciting for gamers who just thought it would be all about the Nintendo DS. The Wi-Fi USB Connector from Nintendo, which worked with the Nintendo DS, now works as a accessory for the Nintendo Wii. You can use this for the DS to play against players from the internet on handheld DS games like Mario Kart DS, Tetris DS, and many other great games. Also, it is now a great tool for Wii owners as well. You can simply use this to download great games for the Wii's virtual console like Super Mario 64, and Bonk's Revenge from the Turbographx 16 classic system. I definitely think this is a great buy more than ever for anyone who owns a Wii and for DS owners too.

4.0	Works for PS2. Doesn't seem like a good choice for use on the PC with all the better modern options, but this is what you want for use on the Playstation 2 console. Does what I had hoped.
4.0	"If you love hidden object games this one's for you! At first I didn't understand what exactly the ""bilingual"" meant by Amazon's title. When you begin the game there is a flag in the center of the page. You can choose between 3 different flags (English, Spanish and I think French). Whichever language you choose, the list of ""hints"" will be in that language. This game is more old school hidden object in that there are plenty of hidden object games and even though there is a ""story"" you can pretty much ignore it if you want to. There are a couple of items on the list that you might have trouble finding. That is because sometimes in other English speaking countries things are not always called the same thing as we call them. Examples I found in the first few puzzles are, a soccer ball is called a ""football"" and a flashlight is called a ""torch."" The game has a few mini games but they are not so impossible that you cannot get through them to finish the game. To get more hints you should find a ""sun"" on the hidden object page and sometimes to add more time to the games you have to find a ""sand timer.""

The only reason that I didn't give this game 5 stars is because there must be a ""bug"" in the game where sometimes you locate the correct item and no matter how many times you click on it, it doesn't respond. It seemed that when I used ""hint"" button the answer was the exact item that I had already tried. I thought it was just my game, but another reviewer had the exact same problem. It is not so major that it affects the game play.

I recommend this game wholeheartedly! For Everyone Who Loves Hidden Object Games."
4.0	"This game is, of course, much like the other Just Dance games on the market. Just Dance 2014 has new songs and some new dance moves as well. I wasn't a fan of all the songs, but then it's not possible to always like them all. Maybe one of the best parts of this game is that you can dance to the Ghostbusters theme song! What could be better? :)

Overall, a lot of fun and great exercise! Fun Like The Others"
4.0	good but not great Works for kids.
4.0	I really like this game, but I can't say I love it because the dialogue is terribly written and boring. I kind of get the sense of the story but the dialogue is all in rhymes which are not clever or entertaining, the characters are all bleh boring. What makes up for it is the very fun battle system, similar to grandia with a bar that tells you which character goes next, you can time your attacks to interrupt enemies and knock them back, if you do it well enough you can win a battle by just interrupting enemies and never get damage done. The game is not real deep, in that the many of the characters feel just like the others, except for Aurora the main character and Finn your mage they are pretty similar in abilities etc. Despite it's flaws I do like this game, and for $15 definitely worth it, and if they made a sequel (with a new writer) I'd buy it. If I could give it 3.5 stars that would be perfect but I think it's closer to a 4 star game then a 3 star game. Amazing art style, great music, very fun battle system, mediocore/confusing story
4.0	This unit can do a lot of things it's Moblie entrainment system. Weather you want to stream Netflix or watch bluray movies it can deliver. Can find great games or play music . This slim unit is the smallest of the bunch size wise but had the biggest storage of 500 gb memory. This unit can be used wirelessly or hard wired to the internet via Ethernet cable. My only issue was the unit has a sliding door where you put the game inn is easily open by bumping and wishing I could stand the unit vertically like the older models. Overall I great unit I will keep .. Even thou I have a ps4. PS3 can't go wrong
4.0	It's a controller stand, it holds my controller and that's it. It looks clean on my desk when I actually remember to use it. It's a stand
4.0	"Okay I haven't played any On the rails shooters until this. This game was awesome, and it was so cool. None of the characters even come close to compare to Isaac, but they are cool.

Sound: 9/10, Not the best sound I have ever heard, but i think its damn good.
Graphics: 10/10, I'm not gonna cut the score for not having super great graphics (it is WII), for a Wii game it has over the top great graphics.
Fear Level: 0/10, So not scary its not move at your own pace so it wasn't scary at all.
Overall Appeal: 9/10, Great game, EA should be proud to call it a Dead Space game. All Wii and PS3 owners should own this (sorry Xbox 360 you got excluded out of the awesomeness). For the PS3 version that came with Dead Space 2."
4.0	this was a hard to find gift for a one of a kind person. thanks for the joy you brought all it said it would be
4.0	"Beyond Divinity (BD) is the sequel of recent great RPG ""Divine Divinity."" As much as the newest game in the series has a much better title (must say that Divine Divinity is a bit to rethoric), the gameplay doesn't really get better.
Let's examine che characteristics of this game:
Story: 9 out of 10.
Great main story going on. You command both a hero and an anti-hero: a Paladin and an Avenger (unholy Paladin). Their fates are tied together, so if one dies, both die. I don't want to spoil too much, but, in my humble opinion, the main story line is well developed and scripted.
Graphics:
8.5 out of 10. BD has a good blend of 2D and 3D graphics to it. Looks very much like a mix between Diablo II and games from Bioware's Infinity Engine (Baldur's Gate, Fallout, Planescape, IceWind Dale II). Special FX from magic and similar powers are very well done.
Sounds: 7 out of 10.
Hmm, could be done a bit better but overall satisfactory.
Gameplay: 7 out of 10.
Here is where I find the major flaws of the games.
For first, the game has the real cool feature that environments are highly interactive and fun to explore. This, while fun at times, becomes a major pain when a quest assigns you to find a particular object and you end up ""mouse hunting"" the whole screen. I couldn't find any key that would highlight interactive objects in the environment, and this made me go insane from times to times.
For second: the game feature a Diablo-style random dungeon generator. This generator is not well implemented and since it is used only for ""side quests"" you really don't have to do I would avoid totally going for them. The reasons I don't like these dungeons are: 1) poor graphics (while the non random parts of the game are really good); 2) awful monster generation (in one dungeon I had a quest to kill a particular monster and he was nowhere to be found, in another dungeon there were ABSOLUTELY NO monsters).
Third: I really didn't enjoy the interface too much (expecially inventory management). It's ok, but should be state of the art by now.
Bottomline: this game is good, not great, not fanta-freakin-tastic, so I would suggest to buy if:
1) You love RPGs.
2) You played the first game (Divine Divinity) and liked it alot.
3) You love well scripted stories and promise you will avoid by all means the random generated dungeons. Good RPG game, nice engine, unfortunately a few flaws."
4.0	I wish they had given some love to the graphics its pretty painful in that aspect. Other than that if you are an old school RE fan this is a must have! Great game but could have done a little better
4.0	"PRO: Best upgrade for the Wii.

CON:  One set of batteries has sort of died after two years.

OTHER: Charge lights are really bright, so if you have them in a bedroom and want to go to sleep, good luck, they are like spotlights in the the night! Best upgrade for the Wii"
4.0	Thx Four Stars
4.0	A very challenging game. It wasn't very scary though and the story was all over the place and by the end you wonder if the story is really that simple and you feel like you mustvr missed something. But gameplay wise it was fun. Very hard but fun. It reminds me a lot of Resident Evil 4 and a little bit of The Last of Us. Very challenging. But fails to be a great horror game.
4.0	Awesome mouse does the job. I did have to get a mouse pad because it kept like messing up when I was using my wooden desk which I didn't have a problem with before with my other mouse. So I purchased a mouse pad and now it works fine. Good but need mouse pad
4.0	"This Namco Museum game for PS2 takes you back to the 80's with arcade hits such as Dig Dug, Rally X and Galaga, not to mention Pac Man and Ms. Pac Man.  In the game selection screen; you even get to hear classic 80's tunes by bands such as Lover Boy and Dexi's Midnight Runners
A must-have for any 80's or arcade fan! Nostalgic fun"
4.0	love the show, thought the game would be fun as well and it is, you wipe out ALOT tho which makes younger kids get bored with it easily. fun game

4.0	"I bought this as a gift for a child. I have played the game a little with her and so I have some idea of how it is and her reactions to it. My rating is based on those points.

The graphics are excellent. But more than just that, it does have interesting puzzles that you must solve. So it helps one think. And thinking good thoughts is not a bad thing. She seemed to have fun with the game. There are some parts of the game which can be a little challenging. A little stumbling block here and there perhaps. For that, just google the level you're at and you should find your clues. Better to try to solve them on your own first unless you're really helpless. Very nice game for girls"

Challanging and Fun Dance Moves!

5.0	This is by far the best looking game I have ever seen,the campaign is a little short if you are a pro at 1st shooters but the online is were it's at,there is enough there to keep you going until the next killzone. All my expectations have been met or surpassed with this game,I just hope every one gets to enjoy it,because you have fanboys out there that try to give games a bad name. (AAA) title-Nothing Compares to it
5.0	I absolutely love this game.  My husband and I like to play games together, but have a difficult time finding ones we both like.  My favorite character is Brick.  My husband's is Lilith.  We played the game a few times through in order to max out our characters and get a Platinum. I punch it.
5.0	ok Five Stars
5.0	Great to have 2 characters not easily found. Five Stars
5.0	This is great for people with PS2's and no DVD players.  YOu can sit at your chair or wherever and without using the controller control DVD's.  Now you can sit back and watch movies and not worry about the conroller cord or being too far away from the system.  In my opinion, this thing is better than using the controller for PS2.  Good investment! Nice little remote

5.0	though i ordered this and did not end up recieving this fomr amazon, i ended up going out and buying one on my own at walmart, but this hooks the kinect to my flat screen with no problem, it wedges it against the tv and does not allow it to budge! amazing
5.0	To me this is the best version of Ms. Pac-man to date. It holds 100% true to the classic. That is if you want it to. You are givin' alot of options which allow you to play on different types of mazes. There are BIG ones, MINI ones, STRANGE ones & CLASSIC ones too. I liked the STRANGE mazes, there was even a maze that hardly had any walls and Ms. Pac-man was out of control. It was cool though. The two player mode is GREAT! You and another player can clear a maze together or alternating. But be careful, if you play simultaneously you run the risk of bumping into one another, this sends you both flying in opposite directions. In this case you could easily go flying into a ghost and lose a life. With all that being said remember if you just want to play the classic original it's all here in this one super game pack. Where would we all be if Ms. Pac-man didn't swallow? Unlike some.. I found NO flaws. Just 100% FUN!

5.0	I put Mario Golf into my brothers Lime Green gmaboy color, expecting mediocrocy. I really don't like Gameboy games compared to the Playstations, and N64's and Dreamcasts etc.. Mario Golf however has amazed me. Its like you are a golfer at a country club entering tournaments and playing other challengers, and rivals. Its like the real thing. The golfing is just 1 part of this great game. Its traveling to different courses and trying to bring a good name, and gold to your own club. The main goal in this game is to win the 4 big tournaments, and meet Mario. Which I havewn't been able to do yet. Yet, I don't get aggrevated, this game isn't impossible, yet you can't win right away. You need to enter, tournaments, practice, get your shot examined, you need to compete in contests, listen to what other golfers have to say, and look for 1-up mushrooms. I play gameboy mainly in the car or on a planride, but this I will play just as much as my playstation. I hope anyone who has gameboy, will go out and buy this, you will be amazed when you see how much fun, and how realistic it really is. The type of Gameboy and mario game you've never seen before

5.0	Absolutely love this game.  Very few issues, even on Windows 7.  I just wish they had a college hockey version. Let's Play Hockey!
5.0	hey this is probably the best game for any system.  i got this game today and it rules.  It has the best graphics, eveyrthing is so smooth in this game, there are no pop-ups and polygonal problems like in the 1st 2 games.  This game features 8 huge levels, i mean HUGE.  these stages are really big and detailed. If you thought the stages in THPS2 rocked, you are gonna be blown away by these stages.  Did I mention the create-a-park mode, because it;s back.  They have many outfits for all the skaters now, like you can even put on little details like do-rags and kinds of socks, so thats a nice addition.  You only get Bam Margera as a new skater but you lose Bob Burnquist.  This game is far superior to Bob's PS2 game.  You also get new tricks, like the revert move and new flatland tricks.  The sound track is excellent, features a mix of punk, hip-hop, and rock.  there are now 9 goals per stage so you are gonna play this for a while.  new additions include interactive people on the stages, you can run into them and stuff but still its a nice feature to have.  the 2-player mode has 2 new games so you go call your friends to come over to play this baby.  But the bad things? yup there is only one complaint I have: WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 2002 TO PLAY ONLINE, yup but still at this rate by 2002 you still won't be done with this game,why don't you stop reading this, and GO BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT, ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY YOU SPENT ON IT!!! one of the best PS2 games to date

5.0	my son and wife loves this Five Stars
5.0	very pleased Five Stars
5.0	"This game is about as close to perfect as any game on any system to date. I know the subject matter is a trifle subjective- RPG/Fantasy or Sports buffs may not get much out of it- but for its genre, it's a perfect 10.

You FEEL a part of the game. You FEEL like you're right there with Sam Fisher lurking in the dark, a deadly shadow on a mission. You feel powerful!

Visually, the game is stunning. The environments are true to life and natural; even the urban sites don't neccessarily feel mapped out or linear. The interaction of light and shadow, the ambience of sounds and contextualized music put you more in the mindset of a film rather than game. (My wife commented that she likes watching me play because it's like watching a spy movie.)

It truly is the nuances that put this game over the top. You grab up a terrorist and you see the fear in his eyes as well as the malice in your characters. Noises in the environments (TVs, radios, etc.) mask the sounds you make- if you're careful. Not to mention the new moves they've added; I particularly like the inverted neck snap!

They've also improved on the multiplayer modes. Those who don't want to invest in online gaming can still enjoy a Co-op story mode in which you and a friend can play together, on the same console, to achieve common goals.

All in all, as in any Splinter Cell title, one really needs to experience it to appreciate it- to set it apart from other ""covert operations"" games- because it holds its own on its own plateau.

Splinter Cell: worth the buy every time. Sam Fisher does it again!"
5.0	Ok so I got the game at 8:30pm the day before it was released...played until 12am...pretty cool. The Mad Max movies have been a favorite since I was a kid in the early 80s.. like 11 years old,so this is a very cool addition to my collection. The game so far is fun,but not as smooth as it could be with some of the hand-to-hand fighting and picking up items. The driving and driving combat is pretty good...so far. I also thought the small collectible car and poster I got was awesome also. Very fun so far,but I guess a game can end up being lame after playing it for 4-5-6 hours into it...hope not but will find out. Long time fan...
5.0	When i first played this game at a friends house i loved it even though i had to do practice because i got 55 percent on a song on easy. Even though i was bad i ended up loving this game. I bought it the next day and played more on easy and beat it. Then i stepped up to medium which was pretty challenging and got 3 stars on every song. I kept playing medium until i could 5 star free bird. Then i stepped up to hard. Hard is well hard. You actually have to move your hand because of 5 fret buttons. I evantually beat hard and now i am on the 7th setlist on expert. i am really good now and this game is so much fun to play. Before this game i didn't really like rock and roll and now i do. This game changes your taste in music. This game is the best thing to happen to video games EVER. I love guitar hero 2
5.0	Playing these makes me regret having never bought the Ratchet & Clank games as a kid. They would have no doubt been a staple in my childhood if I had only known how awesome the series was. Love that Lombax

If you love saber combat, and a good star wars game/story, then buy this game.
Also, there is a third party expansion called 'Movie battles' that takes this game to a whole new level. best saber fighting ever"

5.0	"Rhythm games are not my sort of thing. That's why I found myself surprised to be enjoying this game so much. The main advantage that this game has over its competitors is a good story, with gameplay features borrowed from Professor Layton, and extremely catchy beats. I found myself humming the tunes from this fairly shortly after playing it for the first time.

The plot of the game is focused around a young Frenchman called Raphael, who goes around by night disguised as the notorious Phantom R, an art thief of great style and sophistication. The police are baffled at the ability of this young redheaded thief in a fashionable suit and fedora to disappear. Undoubtedly they asked the random redheaded civilian with glasses and no hat for information, but he didn't see anything. It's that kind of game. Raphael is searching for his father, who went missing years before. During his pursuit he finds himself entwined in the risen Emperor Napoleon's dastardly plans to take over the world. Fortunately his men are susceptible to timed dance moves.

Sound ridiculous? Good, it's meant to. The plot is one of the most entertaining things about this game. Amusing and insane it takes our heroes on a tour of Paris and its environs. And Paris is very much on display here. The city looks gorgeous, even in the 2D that dominates the gameplay. When you do get to see a cinematic cutscene (in glorious 3D no less) it really sours.

The rhythm games are cleverly based around this plot. For example, when sneaking into the Louvre you have to follow a beat to hide behind convenient statues and avoid the guards. When fighting Napoleon's men you have to punch them as they bounce at you in synchronized fashion. When eluding policemen on roller skates you have to jump or duck to avoid capture. And my personal favorite: you get to defend yourself against your archrival's PI child Charlie who attempts to apprehend you by kicking a flaming football at your face. They're all fun, not a little bit silly, and have a catchy beat.

The parts of the game not revolving around playing rhythm games owe a very large debt to Professor Layton. Not so much the puzzle aspect, but the way that you move your character along a map and use the touchscreen to interact with the characters and scenery on it. They even have playcoins you can collect by tapping random areas of the screen. The character and street designs are very nice. These are seen at their full effect when the cutscenes start. These cutscenes are beautifully animated and really capture a spirit of adventure. I wish they would make this into an Anime so we could see it all animated. The 3D is used to good effect in these, especially the first cutscene which has Raphael dancing around a room filled with chandeliers. The rest of the game doesn't use it much, and it's often easier to just turn it off.

Most of this game takes place on the bottom screen. The top screen has a map and is used for all the wonderful 3D cutscenes, but when traveling you pay attention to the touchscreen. In battles the top screen becomes important. These battles alternate between having you tap buttons on the bottom screen with your stylus and hitting buttons. No, you don't have to do both at the same time. That would be horrifyingly difficult.

The downsides to the game are fairly minor but annoying. The rating system is messed up. The game doesn't record your best scores, only an average of all your scores. This means that if you want the game to save you getting an A-Rank score you have to get it right on your first time. Which is almost impossible. Another flaw is the grading system for these ranks. It is too heavily focused on what your last move was. You can get a perfect score right up until the end and then flub only the last note, dropping you down to a C-Rank. It's very irritating.

If any of this sounds compelling try the demo. It's available for free on the Nintendo store. This is one fun game even for non rhythm game fans. While the game doesn't always add up to the sum of its parts, nevertheless it provides a fun ride. Professor Layton with a Beat"
5.0	The Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Age of Mythology series is definitely the best ever sires of real time strategy games.  In all versions of the game you are allowed to control both the armies and economies of your nation.  You can build buildings, creature soldiers or peasants, even priests.  Your peasants you command to do the different menial tasks such as farming, mining, and building castles.  While your armies roam the land either defending your peasants, sieging enemy castles, or raiding their peasants.  Priest have the power to convert both peasants and soldiers.  If you like being king of the world, this is for you.  Finally, I just want to differentiate between the games.  Age of Empires is the oldest of the games and should run on any computer, but I wouldn't recommend the game without either the Rise of Rome Expansion Pack or just buying the Age of Empires Gold Edition.  These two correct many problems with the original Age of Empires.  Next game up the latter for medium computers is Age of Kings (that's what I'm still playing.) It can run on just about any computer with sixty four megs of ram and a two hundred megahertz processor.  I use it on a five hundred megahertz and a one point four gigahertz.  Next game up is the Age of Mythology.  This introduces a whole new realm of playing to the sires.  This one you civilization chooses different gods to worship and is given power from them.  Unfortunately you only get two really spectacular god powers each game and you can only use them once, but then it keeps the game to more strategy and less luck and wildcards.  (It is fun to get the wildcards when you have them though!)  This game should have a processor of I would say at least a six hundred and a graphics card at least thirty two megabytes; and lastly this is not the game for everybody.  I still use Age of Kings/Conquerors not because of my computer, but because I don't like all the crazy stuff in Mythology; I think it distracts from the medieval battle tactics.  Really choosing between Mythology and Age of Kings is just a matter of personal opinion.  I'd say download both demos and try them both; or if you have the money to blow, buy them both.  Either way I think you'll love both of them.  Well that's all for me.  This is just a general over view don't take my words as gold check out the specs and requirements yourself.  I just wanted to help point you in the right direction. The Best Sires of Real Time Strategy Games
5.0	I love the product and would like more color variation Five Stars
5.0	I ordered this game to go with my mortal kombat vs. DC universe game. It is great in that it has all the favorite superheroes in one game. The coolest tghing is that you can create a team of 3 characters and fight the computer or battle it out in 2 player action. You can also change the colors of the characters as well. Makes for great fighting action. Perfect for the Superhero fan!
5.0	Another classic from nintendo.  yeah it's basicly just an nintendo 64 update with a facelift, but that doesn't take awy from the fun.  A great game for a group of friends when you are tired of playing goldeneye or halo.  Yet another reason nintendo is still the best company going Fun for all ages

I have been playing the game that came with the system.  The Lego Movie game.

I think this thing is amazing.  I realized that I can easily play great Sony system games, as easily as I can watch a movie or show on Net flix or Hulu Plus.  You just plug the thing in, turn it on and your set.  The game looks great to me.  Crisp, clear and everything controls and works fantastically.  The first thing I thought of when I woke up was, what games should I buy.  Now, I have a Vita.  I believe I have ten games for it.  But, I had a brain injury in 03.  After waking from a 6 week coma, I was blind.  I did get my vision back.  About 8%.  So, I get really dizzy if I have to look around a lot.  Also, looking and focusing on a small screen for a long time, really messes me up.  I get all dizzy and look like I am drunk.  So, being able to play Vita games on my TV is great.  When I was a kid, we had no money.  I missed so many great PS and PS2 games.  I will be able to rent them with this thing.  A game I was going to buy got bad review.  Right away, I said ""it's ok, I will rent it on the Playstation TV.

I understand this does not have net flux, Hulu or any of that stuff.  Come on people, is that what we've become?  Whenever you are among the first to get something, you have to understand there is a chance of bugs, lack of software and that time must be taken for the thing to find it's footing.  I am 100% happy with my purchase.  I am more excited about this thing than I have been anything in a long time.  Thank you Sony.  I'm in!

I decided to put a video on here.  I did one a few days ago.  It is a fun thing that I've never done before.  So, kids, close your eyes, your screen will fill with fat.  LOLOL

Ok, I tried the PS4 link.  It worked fine for me.  Took a few minutes to connect everything.  I did notice that looking up and down happened fast.  It seemed a bit off.  I have not played the game yet.  I just wanted to try it out.  So, I can not be sure if the stiff controls were from the game or the link.

Update:  Ok, first this.  There is an update coming which will allow four-player Remote Play support to PS TV, also, the Live from PlayStation app, which allows users to watch live gameplay streams from PS4 systems, will be available on both PS Vita and PS TV alongside this update.

That seems interesting.  I play games alone, but I know there are a lot of those out there who will find this new additions great.

So, I am hooked on The Lego Movie Game.  Today, I played for an hour or so.  I went upstairs to eat dinner, came down and did some stuff and went back to playing.  First, the system goes on standby mode when you are not using it.  Yesterday, I had thought I turned it off, only to turn the remote on and have the system come on, with the game in the pause screen.  This is great for those who play, in the midst of having other things to do.  I felt the system.  Even on a day when I have just been playing a game for some amount of hours, the thing is cold.  My house is always at like 65 degrees, the thing never gets hot.  I hear no fans.  Not sure how they did it.  But good job Sony!

I have a tablet by a company that had the name of a fruit.  haha  Not sure if I can say the name.  I also just got a new that company pro.  I play games on Steam, I am assuming I can say that and it is a lot of fun.  I play games that I do not play on consoles.  But, earlier, I had a feeling.  The future.  I have never felt that when playing games like this.  How amazing is it, to be able to play classic, console games, on my TV, for a great price?  Then, on top of that, to have the option to buy or rent some of them.  It gave me a feeling that I've never felt.  I am always one to say, on this site and others, that I sell things on my Amazon store (under a different email) and that I always buy games just so I can sell them when I am finished.  But, I am honestly feeling like that is all in the past.  This is the easiest, fastest way that I have ever witnessed to play great games from a company I have known since the late 90s. You turn the system on, go to your game and play.  Amazing.

I counted about 150 games from the Playstation store, that are on the PS Vita games for PS TV link.  I got the free ones today.  I tried to get one, Sly Cooper, it was free, but, when I clicked on it, it said will not work on Playstation TV.  Then, it tried to download it.  My memory card (8gig) did not have enough space, so I did not get it.  Odd that it said that.  It is either a bug or the game was listed by mistake.

The 720 thing.  If I am not mistaken, most of the games I play on the PS3 say 720.  If it was 720, but they had it said 1080, would you be happier?  As I said earlier, the graphics look fantastic.  I have noticed though, that the frame rate will drop like a fat man into a swimming pool.  Everything looks blocky.  I would say the quality drops by at least 40%.  This does go away though.  It has not happened while I am playing a game.  It is when the game has been sitting for a bit.  But, it is fine with me.

In then end, this is my final though.  Whoa, 90s Springer moment.  I love the PS TV.  I am a game nut.  I don't have much to do right now.  Until I finish high school.  I have every system.  Even the Ouya, the Playstation TV is one of the first systems to really make me just stair at the TV since my Playstation and Playstation 4.  It is finally something completely new.  Well know, A list games, released for a hand held, right on my TV.  Some of the games you can get on other systems.  That is cool.  But this thing lets me be a kid again.  It is an amazing feeling, in todays age to truly be at aw of something.  When I can think of nothing to say, it means something.  I, for one, am blown away.

Also, the Lego Movie Game seems like the perfect game to sell with this system.  It is fun to play for a short time or for hours.  Sony should find other games to put into a bundle.  Would be a great thing for the holidays.

Update 11 - 30 - 14.
I looked, for the first time on the official site for games that can be used on this system.  I had added them before, from another site and I believe I listed the number here.  I wanted to give an update to the number of games you can play now on here.  Some great games that I was to young to play or did not have the money for.

The Sony site is set up so you can easily look through the games and not feel overwhelmed.  They have two lists.  PS Vita games for PSTV and Classic Games.  The total of Vita games is 165.  The total of Classic Games is 480!  Again, there are so many games on there, that I heard about when I was a kid, that I am so excited to play.  I am very happy with my choice to purchase this system. I just realized I could play so many games that I missed when I was growing up.  Then, there I was."

5.0	works great love the big screen Five Stars
5.0	"Hideo Kojima's ""Metal Gear Solid"" (1998) is like a great classic film that has now become required viewing for movie buffs - this is required playing for gaming enthusiasts. It stars Solid Snake, a weary, gruff veteran of the battlefield with a deep, gravelly voice, who always keeps a pack of cigarettes handy just in case. His mission is to infiltrate a nuclear weapons facility on an island off the coast of Alaska, code-named ""Shadow Moses,"" which is currently being occupied by the ex-black ops unit turned terrorist group known as ""Foxhound."" It's not immediately apparent what the group's ultimate goal is, and in fact one of the great pleasures of ""MGS"" is the way in which the story slowly unravels. Many of the characters have secrets and motivations of their own, some of which wisely go unexplained (what's Ocelot really up to?). As a game made on PS1 hardware, the gameplay holds up considerably well for its time. It's played from a third-person top-down perspective. You can equip different gear (rations, binoculars) on the lower left of the screen and weapons (guns, explosives) on the lower right. Stealth plays a big role as you constantly try to avoid alerting the patrolling guards. The best gameplay sequences involve the unique boss battles with the members of ""Foxhound."" These sections are fun because no boss or battle is alike, and each character that you duel feels wholly original. The main draw and what makes this game, and the series, so special is the masterful storytelling that grabs ahold of you and doesn't let go. It's the stellar voice cast, including David Hayter as Snake, the ingenious plot, the phenomenal soundtrack and atmosphere - it's the meticulously crafted world that you can't help being completely absorbed in.

5.0	"Although I liked the PC version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone, I admit without hesitation that Chamber of Secrets on PC is definitely better than its predecessor. It has better graphics, better models and characters that have a mouth that moves when they talk than the first game. Also, it is, among all the games based on the movies, the one I prefer the most. And for several reasons.

One, because the music of this game represents exactly the strangeness and incredible fantasy that dwells int he Harry Potter universe. And just by listening to a couple of tracks you can clearly understand why Jeremy Soule won at the BAFTA awards for the best video game soundtrack. Second, there are are more wizard cards and spells to uncover, so that one can find out more characters that exist in the Harry Potter world, such as the wizard group called Weird Sisters, and other wizards that are never mentioned that have had an influence on the spells culture and wizards politics in JK Rowling's universe. Finally, it is one of the few games I've played that gives a clear and well structured storyline without big plot holes, so that anybody who has never read the books can understand and not feel lost and confused about what's in the novel and what is not. Not only that, the lessons offer more interesting spells to learn and to replay again and again, and also various games such as wizard duels and Quidditch matches.

As such, I think this game is still a great treat to any Harry Potter fan, but also to any PC gamers who love to play a good adventure game. The best of the Harry Potter games on PC"
5.0	This devise makes the dreamcast controller vibrate wile you play the games. Now you might not that that matters but it honestly adds a fun depth to the games you play and it makes them a little bit more interactive. Sega Dreamcast Jumpack
5.0	All good. Five Stars
5.0	Absolutely love this game. I love the choice of many different instruments. My husband played drums in a band for years and says the drums are awesome on this. I play keyboard at home for fun so I love the piano on Wii Music. We have tried all the instruments and had a good time just experimenting all the features available to use. I think Wii Music has made a definite hit with this game. If you love music,you'll love Wii Music!! Wii Music
5.0	Great sound and extremely comfortable. Occasionally have to remind myself to check the cables and make sure they are all the way in but that's the price you pay when you're taking them off and on all the time. Great headset even without the mixamp
5.0	"It does what you expect it to. Just be careful if you get it used. I got mine used and I noticed that the right stick drifted to the left slightly. In addition the right bumper had trouble registering a hit. Lastly, the grooves on the controller had a lot of dirt in them so it would be a good idea to take apart the controller and clean it out. If you can I would recommend getting this only in a ""like new"" condition. It works okay. Be careful if you get it used."
5.0	A fantastic game for old or new fans to the Persona series. But it's more impactful if you've played Persona 4. So you'll feel those connections to each character. I highly recommend the dlc tracks, otherwise it'll feel a bit repetitive. But with a decent story-line, colorful display of characters and costumes alike, there's tons to unlock in it. You feel like you completed everything in the game, and then bam! You unlock another track. It's full of surprises. It's more enjoyable on the pstv, for the colorful display on your tv. After owning the game for a couple months now, I just realized it was touch-screen compatible. Meaning, you aren't only limited to button mashing! All in all, a very good purchase! A Rhythm Game, At Its Prime!
5.0	So much fun! I really enjoyed this game and I spent hours beating people in story mode. heh heh heh >:3 I recommend getting this for someone who loves MP without getting mad if they lose. Super fun! :D GET THIS IF YOU'RE  A MARIO PARTY LOVER!!!
5.0	first off i'm not one of them game nerds that play games all day but it was so much fun when i turned it on i then became one. COD

5.0	"My son couldn't be more delighted with the Afterglow Karga headset, which is a nice addition to his Xbox. The padding is comfortable and not uncomfortably hot, and he's thrilled with the warm blue 'glow' once the headset connects to the gaming device.

He's enjoying his gaming a lot with these headphones, including the boom mike. A definite improvement on his previous headset, he said.

Totally pre-teen recommended! The best Xbox headset out there"

5.0	"I don't need to say how great of a game Starcraft is, you know it is.

But, if you have Windows 7 be careful with this purchase.  Windows 7, since the task bar can only be removed through disabling explorer, screws up the colors.
You may want to invest in the power needed to play Starcraft 2 if you're using 7. Great game, but read this if you have Windows 7"
5.0	"Excellent game. Fun, Challenging . You'll never want to put it down. The voice acting is great so is the story and if you're a history buff, you'll enjoy it even more because the story is based on actual characters (more or less).. The graphics are gorgeous and beautiful. Music is done so well. It's like you are in a movie. The puzzles are not hard but not easy. Later on, you have to think on how to complete it in order to proceed. Naughty Dog has stated that this is the final game (as far as they are concerned.. SONY owns the game) and it wraps up pretty nicely... With a twist.

  I can't recommend this game enough. You will enjoy this and the time will go by very quickly. Breathtaking and Mesmerizing."
5.0	I LOVE THIS GAME Five Stars
5.0	Wow, what can I say. For the price I have a comfortable pair of headphones that I can wear for 8 hours straight without a headache. They also come apart so you can use them on a PS4 controller! Incredible buy. So far I have no issues with these. I wish I bought these for my kids as well. Why would you pay over $100 dollars for Turtle Beach for what? Looks? This is what you want!
5.0	"Finally.  I've been looking for a nice, solid, lighted keyboard without a dozen extra keys/controls that I wouldn't use, that doesn't light up like a merry go round at the county fair, and that doesn't have a huge footprint.  This keyboard fits the bill.  Well built and weighty.  You will need to download the G610 s/w from Logitech to add a lot of features, especially the one for turning off the wave lighting (very annoying).  The scrolling wheel volume feature is a great addition.  The s/w has the option of installing ""Overwolf"".  This will detect games and automatically highlight the keys for gameplay.
In short, great keyboard.  You might want to purchase a wrist pad for $10.00. Finally"

5.0	"Sonic the Hedgehog.  Sega's mascot has been around a long time, and has always had a following.  With Sega dropping console status and just sticking to development, all of the various Sega franchises have drifted around and landed in various places.  Sega's most famous character, Sonic, and all of his gang have landed in the strangest place of them all:  Nintendo.

I realize that Sonic Mega Collection and Sonic Gems and Sonic Heroes have come out multi-platform, but Sonic Adventures were released on Gamecube, and Shadow the Hedgehog has just come out on Nintendo's box.  Also, the former rival is home to the real Sonic games:  Sonic Advance 1, 2, and 3 on the Game Boy Advance.

It's true, that Sonic belongs in 2D.  The sense of speed, of gravity-defying, dizzying velocity is really something that never translates well in 3D.  Sonic just doesn't move as fast and doesn't control as well as he does when he's blazing through the 2D worlds that populate his games.  Something is always lost in translation.  There's no feeling of rocketing through worlds at insane speeds.

Well, the Advance games remedied that, but they didn't quite have the scope and balance of the original sonic games.  Yes, they were fast, but they were also ... kind of small feeling.  They felt like portable versions of sonic games.  They were good, but I always preferred the old-school Sonic games as the real achievements.

Well, Nintendo has a new portable out, with a lot more power, and so it was just a matter of time before Sega would bring the Hedgehog over.  How does Sonic Rush make out?  Well, let me just say this:  I might have a new favorite Sonic game.  And if not, it's very close.

Sonic knocks the Blue Hedgehog kicking and screaming into a new handheld glory.  This is a giant, beautiful game, with the kind of level design not seen since the old-school sonics.  With the two screens of the DS, the Hedgehog's vertical now, with levels that launch our hero sky-ward and back across both screens without any real trouble in the transition between screens.  It's fluid and gorgeous.

Actually, gorgeous is a great word for the entire game.  The levels themselves are classic 2D.  Not overly flashy, but beautiful and perfect for blurring past.  With Sonic, flashy little details aren't as important as looking good for the split second you'll see it, and the levels don't dissappoint.  Sonic himself is a 3D model, a pretty good one that moves wonderfully on the screen and makes for some nice effects on levels as he sometimes is thrown closer to the screen due to cranes, elevators, and slides that push forward in a wonderful melding of 2D and 3D.

The boss battles, though, are done entirely in 3D.  So far, I haven't had the kind that takes place in an arena (where you can move all over) but instead on tracks where you can go left and right.  But the boss is 3D, and you move in 3D space, and it really works in a retro sort of way.  Yes, it's 3D bosses, but they move and behave with patterns that are wonderfully old-school.

Yes, there's a second character, a purple female feline named Blaze the Cat, but I've spent most of my time right now with Sonic.  It seems that she controls similarly, and thus there's no lengthy distractions with slower characters (I'm looking at you, Sonic Adventure games!).  This one's all about speed.

And the control!  This game is perfect.  It's all tight and responsive, and you'll need it, because with the speed Sonic goes, one mistake will send you careening into an enemy or plunging to your doom.  It's not overly challenging (none of the Sonics are, if you ask me), but it's good and it does require skill, and that's really the whole point.

I love this game.  I love Sonic, and this is one for the ages.  Trust me, if you want a great classic console experience, this is it (and it fits in your pocket)!  It's a must buy.  It won't disappoint, I guarantee it. Sonic the way Sonic should be!"
5.0	"I Love this game I have it for PS3, PC and now PS4. If you have a PS4 and haven't already played this game go check out some YouTube videos, then come back and buy it!

Seriously if the words like JRPG, Anime, or EPIC gameplay! Sound like fun you should check this out. Buy this game!"
5.0	Like other games that came out in the same time period e.g. Dues Ex, the Hitman Codenamed 47 will go down in history.  Unlike FPS of today, the game takes skill and patience to play. Classic!
5.0	Thank you so much :-) Five Stars
5.0	I decided to pick this game up on my vita this year because i always buy the show on my ps3 but buying the vita i could save 20 bucks. This game is still amazing. You truly feel like you are playing the ps3 version of the show. I have not played online so i cant comment on that. The road to the show is pretty much what i play on the show and is still as addicting as ever. Really not much to say about this game if youve played the ps3 version you you can pick this game up and have no problems. The touch screen works so well and is a great shortcut to navagate the menus. The graphics are wonderful in this game. Blows my mind that a handheld game can look so good. Again there is not much you can say about this game. Most of you know what you are getting with this game and its still the amazing game we all fell in love with even on a little screen. Vita the show better than most console sports games
5.0	FUN TO HAVE. Five Stars

5.0	Rogue Galaxy is another great game from Level-5 Inc. It may not be as great as Dragon Quest VIII, but to me it is a recovery from Dark Cloud 2, which was the most monotonous game I've ever played. Rogue Galaxy itself can be a little tedious, with repetitive dungeons and battles, but the complexity of the battle system makes the game very enjoyable. The plot is great and the voice acting is amazing and often humorous. The graphics and music are fine and the ability to create weapons in the factory and level them up adds a huge bonus to this game's fun factor. The synthesis is amazing, and searching for the legendary swords was exciting. Overall this game is a fun sixy-hour experience. I'd like to point out that, like many recent games, the back of the case tricks you into thinking that the game is 100+ hours. It is if you sit there and play it for 100+ hours, that is such false advertising (they say that on Disgaea 2 as well). Any game can be 100000 hours if you play it for that long. This game takes about 50-60 hours to beat, if you're slow like me. Not Dragon Quest, but it is great in its own unique way.
5.0	"This game is spectacular! It has no flaws. The first game limited you, and, no offense to the designers, had the most hideous facial graphics ever! In Max Payne 2, he has great facial graphics. The game is more like a movie, it has calm scenes that may be in the NYPD offices and apartments to The Cleaners (Hence the name) and The Fun House (Hence the name again).

5.0	I don't even think midnight club LA has matched this game in terms of customizing your cars and just solid racing fun.  Picked this up for a few dollars when my old copy came up missing.  Would recommend if you still have a ps2 hiding in a closet somewhere. Probably the best midnight club there was
5.0	works perfectly on those older hd tv's that only offer component cables as opposed to HDMI Five Stars
5.0	it's great to have an extra month for the price. very happy with this purchase. it would be nice if they sold 4 months card instead of three months card more often. 4 months nice.
5.0	I was a little cautious to buy one of these used, but I didn't want to spend $150 for a new one. When I received it, the packaging was incredible and protected the product well. It was practically brand new with absolutely no scratches or marks, or any real sign of use to be honest. Hooked it up and it works as intended. Calibrated easily and I've yet to come across any issues with it. What an awesome buying experience! Buy it used instead of new - it's worth it!!
5.0	Obviously this is Battlefield we're talking about, I bought it because I like the Battlefield Games, Quite a good game so far. Great game if you like Battlefield games

5.0	Husband had this when he was younger. I saw it on here and got it for him, he loves it. =) =)
5.0	if you love the series  you will love the game  just wish the rest of the crew was in here but its still great game . you got to get it ! omg its awsome !!
5.0	Exerbeat is a great workout program and game. It makes working out fun and enjoyable. My 5 year old nephew absolutely loves it. I make sure to do 30 minutes on it everyday! Exerbeat is great!
5.0	The soundtrack by David Wise is worth the price of admission alone.  The actual game is ridiculously good.  A masterpiece of level design, mechanics, and creativity.  If you are even considering one bit purchasing DK Tropical Freeze, please, just do it. Stunning
5.0	Woe is me.  This game is fantastic, and it is a long and non-linear open world that you can do whatever kind of post apocalypse wasteland with mutants and settlers that need saving - you can play so many styles.  First person shooter?  Check (you are the only human player).  Melee with blunt objects?  Go for it.  Like long range sniping?  Check.  Crafting?  The craft system requires you to gather junk to collect parts to get useful stuff.  Screws and Glues - that's the rare stuff needed to make nearly every crafting recipe.  Crafting upgrades to your guns.  Crafting upgrades to your and your companions and settlers gear.  Crafting food recipes. Cooking up drugs to sell to the vendors (best cash in the game).  Wandering the countryside and exploring.  It has it all.  Now if Only I didn't need to work I could get enough game play in. If you liked that other one, you're gonna love this one.
5.0	Absolutely amazing game that came in perfect condition and right on time! Totally reccomend it to any and all gamers and would purchase from this seller again! EVERY GAMER SHOULD HAVE A COPY!!!
5.0	I use this every day with my PS Vita Slim. Also stored inside are a few game cards, headphones, short USB cable, screen cloth, and an ANKER 1000mAh battery pack. I'm not really using it for fall protection but I feel comfortable having it in my backpack or carrying it around. The stitching on the corners seemed weird at first but they are consistent for all the corners so that isn't a big deal to me. Wish the zipper was quieter is all. Used Daily
5.0	"I've got about thirty-five hours into this game. I haven't been focused on running through the story but rather doing what I can to fully explore the map as I advance from East to West. Here are my two bits thus far:

Pro:
-What you've heard over and over again about the game being visually gorgeous is not an exaggeration. From the plains to the deep forests all of the environments are fully realized and deeply immersive.
- Unlike most open-world games it's possible, if you put a little effort into it, to obtain significant upgrades to your equipment fairly early on in the game. This is a refreshing change from most games where you finally manage to get some fantastic gear too late in the game to make a difference.
- The crafting system is complete and well thought out. Materials are plentiful enough that you can always go find some but not so common that you can take them for granted. They struck a great balance here.
- Speaking of balance the combat system is fantastic and rewards intelligence. With a little thought and some careful planning you can take down even massive enemies at a fairly low level, but if you go try to stand toe-to-toe with a robotic T-Rex you'll get slaughtered no matter how tough you are.
- The story is (so far) interesting and well-paced, and a fresh take on the apocalypse. I find myself genuinely interested in how this world came to be and I'm enjoying the process of putting the pieces together.
- I have, so far, not encountered a single bug or glitch, not even a minor one. It's sad that that needs to be pointed out as a ""pro"" but these days bug-free games aren't a given.

Cons:
- With the story being unique and very little exposition given to you up front the world you're in can be a little confusing for a while. Aloy may have grown up in this world but we didn't, and the story assumes we know things about these primitive tribes and their politics that we just don't.
- The setting may not be to everyone's taste, I suppose.

To my mind that's some pretty heavy Pros balanced against some very minor Cons. Overall I'd say this game is well worth your money.

UPDATE:
Having finished the game I have a few things to add. The story that I found so interesting at first only gets better as you reveal each piece, with a resolution that's equal parts uplifting and heartbreaking. Even without the fantastic gameplay I think this aspect alone is worth your money. This game earns every one of its five-star reviews, I can't wait for a sequel. Simply Amazing"
5.0	"To rival Street Fighter II and its success, this game comes out and starts up a huge controversial topic about violence in video games. When it was ported to consoles, several versions didn't have the gore. The Super Nintendo game was one of them. WHAT?! You dare criticize an awesome fighting game just because there wasn't blood?! What greed.

The gameplay is pure one-on-one fighting. You can choose from a number of fighters (I choose Sub-Zero), and then you battle onward from fighter to fighter. Eventually, you'll get to the Endurance rounds, which let you face against the defeated fighters, but you must face 2 under one go. That is what makes the game stand out.

The graphics are as great and faithful to the original arcade version's.
I can say the same for the sound and music quality.

Overall, it's a really good fighting game that shouldn't be ignored. Even without the blood. No blood? No problem."
5.0	Ok so I finally got a PSP and I needed a case, so I go on amazon and find the cheapest one I can find. Its a pretty good case, it can probibly hold 4 to 6 games easily... anymore would be hard to close the case. It has a good hard shell and keeps your PSP. So if you only carry a few games with you this is a perfect case! Great case if you don't have too many games
5.0	"There have been great technological advancements in video gaming, but this game is probably the best football game ever. It is hard to match up this game against Madden 25 for PS4 in a number of ways because of graphics, but Tecmo Super Bowl really stands the test of time. I have spent countless hours playing this game and finished countless seasons, and it still remains fun. One of the very best video games of all time and for some reason it never gets old trying to beat personal bests such as scoring the most points in a game, most rushing yards in a game or season, etc... In that regard, it is much more difficult than the NCAA and Madden games where you can easily figure out the AI and rack up more and more points and yards as you get used to the game.

This is an all time classic. One of the top 5 best games ever!"
5.0	"What a beautiful bundle!

First of all, Destiny is a really awesome game. To have it bundled for $10 off if you were to buy it separately is a great deal, but not so much if you just love the white PS4, and not necessarily the game. This is the only option though, FOR NOW. How do I know? Because the inner packaging, after you unbox the Destiny branded outter box/packaging, what you see is another box/packaging that only shows the white PS4 advertising, specifically stating that it's the ""Glacier White"" version. So what does that mean? It means that this Destiny bundle is only a limited time edition, and that a regular, non-Destiny Glacier White PS4 is coming soon. I guarantee and stake my reputation on it. In fact, don't be surprised if it is an option for this upcoming holiday season, maybe as early as Thanksgiving.

On to the console itself - what can I say, if you love white, and white gadgets and electronics, then this is the PS4 for you. It WILL stand out amongst your other electronics, and is perfect if you have an Apple setup next to it/nearby. However, if you love the actual Destiny skin, the only version that's available now is the Japanese version, which actually has a Destiny decal on the console. The material/finishing is the same as the black PS4 - matte white on one half, glossy white on the other.

Finally, the PS4 Dual Shock controller is also white. Amongst my PS3 controllers, the white one was my favorite(I also had the regular black, and the red and blue versions), so this one naturally became my favorite for the PS4. However, unlike the PS3 version, this version is not uniformly the same white color throughout. The back plate, which wraps around to a little on the front side, is an off-white, bright gray color, similar to the two-tone of the black version. I wish it was all bright white, and I also wish the buttons, analog sticks, touch panel, and trigger buttons were white too, but I guess you can't have everything.

So I just wanted to add my two cents worth about this bundle, and that if you only want the white PS4 and have the patience to wait, then just grind it out for a few more months! Awesome Bundle, But If You Only Want the White PS4, Then WAIT - It's Coming!"
5.0	"There are some games that you play that just are ""games"" and not experiences. Earlier titles such as the Rebel Assault games were as such. The gamer did not feel like they were actually ""doing"" what was happening in the game. Games such as Quake and Duke Nukem and Doom, while entertaining, are superficial and do not engross the gamer.
But X-Wing: Alliance is different. Where as Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six changed the way we play first person shooters (how many times did your palms sweat on missions that you could not be detected?), X-Wing Alliance changes the way we play flight sims. This isn't a superficial space shooter that leaves the gamer hungry for more. In fact, it is completely satisfying. The story is compelling, the graphics are sharp, the gameplay is never dull, and the music is, well, Star Wars.
The missions will leave you hooked for hours, constantly forcing you to put off that paper that must be written or that supply report that was due on your boss' desk three days ago. You are ultimately rewarded for your longevity and resourcefullness by hopping into the Millenium Falcon (assuming the role of Nien Nunb or Lando...I never figured that one out) and blasting tie fighters at the battle of Endor. And if you think that the Falcon didn't do much at that battle, just wait until you fly the 4 missions of that battle, and you'll have a new respect for what Lando did (especially the VERY HARD final mission of flying into the Death Star. Expect to spend a few days here)!
When you talk about Multi-player, this game excells in all areas. You can log on and play solo against others or join groups and coordinate battles. All ships in the game can be flown in multiplayer (I especially grew fond of the Toscan Fighter, though nothing beats the shear power of the X-wing).
Overall, an excellent game. Not only is it fun to play and enthralling, but you actually at most points feel as if you are in the game. When you fail a mission and decide that you need to make your multiple jumps back home instead of just quitting the mission right then, you'll know how engrossing this experience really is. Be prepared to become engrossed in the game"
5.0	"Intro

Kingdom Hearts, a magical wonder for all to enjoy. This game is one of the best games ever made. It's Graphics are top notch, as well as the beautiful cut scenes. The music is the best. Not one world has the same.

The Game

This game you play as Sora, he lives on a beach with his two friends. One night when they are planning to escape the island because they feel trapped not knowing anything that lays beyond the ocean. On the night they get ready to leave the island is encased in darkness, and when sora awakes he is in a strange new land. Where he soon meets some familiar characters, Donald Duck and Goofy umm Goofy...Anyways, they set sail on their newfound ship to various disney worlds in search of Sora's lost friends, and King Mickey. They eventually defeat the darkness in their own hearts and find King Mickey and his friends, but they are lost again. The adventure than continues, but not in this game.

Conclusion

This is a wonderful game reccomended for any disney fan, and any Final Fantasy fan. The Final fantasy characters are in this game too. Not much but a little. Dont ask me how Disney and Final Fantasy got together Great game"
5.0	Bought on the recommendation of a friend.  He was right.  This game is different and fun. FUN
5.0	"It's different than the games I am used to but that isn't bad. It is interesting and a nice challenge for old and new gamers alike. I have heard this game called a ""classic"" and I can see how many ways this is true. Great game!"
5.0	I have bought four of these now, all amazing. I consider this the best controller ever made. The black one I bought in 2001 on release day lasted me for over a decade of competitive Smash Melee, but in 2012 I finally bought one of these. I bought more for backups, you simply cant go wrong Japanese Gamecube Controller
5.0	"I Love this game so much. I got it for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved it too. We play Zombies and the multiplayer a lot abd everything runs smoothly and looks awesome. I highly recommend getting this and that you attempt the Easter eggs on the zombie maps and learn the story. Great maps all around, good graphics and loadout customization in the campaig . There's plenty to do for fun and it's above and beyond. Get this. My girlfriend quickly learned how to play and really liked it. First time we played,  ""Mob Of The Dead"", her and I made it to round 32! Love it,  get it."
5.0	I love the Lego movie franchise of games, and Batman feels more like the original, classic Lego Star Wars than Indiana Jones did. The between scenes movies are better than the others, and the game play is just as fun. Makes me want to go buy Legos
5.0	I played this tonight after I received the game in the mail. Overall it is very addicting to see the storyline progress and I like the way you can affect the outcomes. There are supposedly 8 endings. I am on the last part of Stage 7 (8 stages total), and I've played for about 9 hours 45 minutes. So the game is pretty short... I did not mess with the arcade game in the bar though. But if you go for the different endings and two different girls, you will obviously have a lot of replay value. Catherine has many funny moments and everyone can relate to the relationship issues in here. The puzzles are CHALLENGING which is what I like. There were times when I was very frustrated screaming at the TV, and a few had me redoing them for over half an hour because I couldn't solve them correctly. People who get frustrated easily will probably not enjoy this game. The stages actually require you to think and use your brain. I wish there were more games like this. If you get stuck, it's better to just restart from the checkpoint or do something differently because there aren't infinite ways to solve each puzzle. You're either doing it right or wrong. Bottom line Catherine is UNIQUE and one of the best PS3 games I've played in a while. I rarely buy a full price game freshly released but this was definitely worth my money. Fun & original
5.0	I don't play multiayer, only campaigns.  With that said, I am enjoying the game and the story.  The graphics are great, no issues playing at Ultra settings with 780Ti. The graphics are great, no issues playing at Ultra settings with 780Ti

5.0	"I was expecting this game to be choppy on my computer but it runs extremely smooth. The graphics are extremely impressive and the campaigns are immersive. Each mission feels like you are actually making a difference. The voice-over comments add real depth to the experience.

I am not a big fan of Activision but I am a big fan of Blizzard. If they price the other 2 expansions at 60 dollars, I have no intention of buying either.

Nearly every single 1 star rating complained about no LAN play and no offline play. However, you can play offline, if you want. The ""no LAN support"" issue sounds like a complaint that would have been relevant 15 years ago, not today where broadband internet is in nearly every home.

It's a very fun game if you don't mind the inability to play over a LAN and have an internet connection up all the time so that you can play in your account instead of as an offline guest. I've yet to experience the multiplayer aspect. Surprisingly Impressed"

5.0	I can't get over how awesome the 3DS XL is, for one thing. I had a day one Aqua Blue 3DS, and I loved that thing, but within a week of having my Pikachu 3DS XL, I couldn't imagine playing on a standards 3DS again. The screen was so much bigger and everything looked better. The only issue I've come across is that it's a little harder to keep myself in the 3D sweet spot, but since I play everything with the 3D off unless I'm just messing around, that isn't an issue for me at all. And it has Pikachu on it! OMG
5.0	works well Five Stars
5.0	For a multiplayer gamer this is essential. I like having easy access to the volume and mute commands. If you have one of the older controllers and need to connect a headset with the 3.5 jack this is a must. An essential part of my gaming setup.
5.0	Exactly as described. Five Stars
5.0	Got this on sale, and I was like YAAS! I've been wanting this game, and it was a deal I could not pass up. and I was like YAAS! I've been wanting this game
5.0	Finally you can live the epic battles of the Star Wars films! Fantastic action, great vehicles, fighters and top-notch visuals and you have a game that every SW fan must have! Having ultimate choice is fantastic! You can be a stormtrooper gunning down rebels on Endor, a wookie on Kashyyk, a clone trooper on Geonosis or even a droideka on Naboo. Great stuff. I cannot say enough good things about this game. Not to mention the downloadable patches to add to the number of locales, like Jabba's palace. The instant action feature lets you drop right into the middle of the wars, or the option of Galactic Conquest is fun too, fighting alongside Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker. Brilliant! If you don't have this, buy it NOW! You WILL buy this game! Best Star Wars VG Ever!

5.0	"This is a great game for kids.  My son, who hates to do anything related to school work (i.e., reading, math, writing, etc), absolutely loves it.  He can sit there and play it for hours.  Ordinarily, I would not allow him to just sit around and play a video game, but this one is great for him.  It allows him to be entertained while practicing essential skills (i.e., creativity, spelling, and writing).  We were so impressed with the game that we decided to get it for my daughter too.  She loves it too.  I couldn't be happier with this product.

Best part is you can get a downloadable code from Amazon and have the coins in your SWTOR account within minutes, without having to leave the comfort of your computer desk!  Fast, convenient, and great value...really, what more do you want?  A free pet?  You get that too! It's like getting $20 in free Cartel Coins!

5.0	"I've played all the Nancy Drew games, and was so disappointed with the last two (Danger by Design, and The Creature of Kapu Cave) that I thought about not buying this one at all.  But I really haven't found anything else to compare to these addictive games, and I enjoyed this one much more than the last two.  The resort setting was similar to Treasure in the Royal Tower, and I found the puzzles to be interesting and mildly challenging.  There was no weird switching back and forth between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys like in Kapu Cave (the Hardy Boys aren't in this one at all).

A common complaint with these games is that they're too short, but the basic formula works for me.  And I've never had any trouble playing any of the games on my computer, a 3 year old laptop that's not suitable at all for high graphics games. Enjoyable"
5.0	very good seller I get everything in perfect condition well fast excellent product all I taste what I recommend to all excellent product
5.0	still works Five Stars
5.0	Awesome storyline. I liked the live action sequences to accent the story telling. Felt that the gameplay could have been a little more fluid and led clunky. Overall though, I really enjoyed it. Great Story even with slightly flawed gameplay.

5.0	This way you don't have to get another entire Nyko charger set.  I'm not sure how long the rechargeable batteries last but i'm sure they eventually run out of juice.  At $6.99 each you can't go wrong. I may even get some extras.  Only bad thing is you cannot choose the color on the backing! I purchased one on 9/12/07 and rec'd a turquoise one. Perfect for the Nyko Charger Set
5.0	"When this came out I thought, ""WHY?"" would anyone want to play this game. Eventually I picked up a copy in a bundle with FC4. WOW was I wrong, this is a super fun and beautiful game. Refreshing too. I can't believe I almost missed this experience. Primal is a real joy to play! Surprising and Refreshing. Super fun too!"
5.0	I heard about this game from my friends and I must admit, at one point I hated Xbox (girl screams in background).  Well folks, it was this marvelous game that changed my mind.  This piece of Heaven owns people.  That's about the extent of it all.  The AI is unrivaled by any other game I have played in my life.  The single player is most definitely a wonderful aspect to the action, but multiplayer....Sweet Lord above....You WILL NOT find anything that can even come close to dreaming about beating this game...I literally went out and bought an Xbox just for this game.  And if they were to not make any more games for Xbox I wouldn't mind as long as I had Halo.  And I am dead serious about that. I think that's enough said....it's a shame the rating system only stops at a mere 5.... There is no equal...
5.0	Great keyboard, even ordered a second one for another desktop. I am not a gamer and these keyboards were bought so I could see what I was typing without having loads of light or night time working so for me the keyboard is comfortable, the keys have a good touch and I like the choice of the 3 colors of light, (blue-default, red, and purple, the red and purple are actually a little brighter). all in all a good keyboard and the one I have had for well over a year without issue and the keyboard is used daily for several hours per day/night. Great for my purposes
5.0	"...don't fix it, and fortunately, Sega has continued a winning formula with the 2nd installment of Project Diva F.  Chances are, if you're thinking about buying this game, you know what to expect, but after putting in a few hours day one with the game, here are some observations.

The core gameplay is intact from the first Project Diva F with just a few modifications.  New features include the addition of ""double stars"" (which require the tapping of both directional sticks to clear) and ""linked stars"", where a single star target moves along a path, and the target must be hit at several points along the path.

Other minor tweaks to the game include small changes in the Diva room (the head-petting game is still there with a few small modifications; the characters seem to get annoyed somewhat more easily this time around).  There are also more items to buy in the shop, such as skins to customize the look of the game.

If you've tracked down an import copy of Project Diva 2nd for the PSP, many of the songs which are unlockable early in the game will be familiar, including ""Melt"", ""Packaged"", and ""Clover Club"".  I really like all of those songs, so that is a plus, but there are a number of other songs on the setlist which are recycled from earlier Project Diva installments.  If this really bothers you, then you should probably deduct one star from the game's rating.

One major change from the first Project Diva F game is the difficulty levels.  The overall difficulty of the ""Easy"" and ""Normal"" levels seems significantly ramped up from the previous games.  I'd say a 4-star difficulty song in normal mode this time around would be equivalent to a 5 or 6 star song in hard mode in the previous game.  For instance, there are some weird button sequences that show up in normal mode that wouldn't have appeared until the hard difficulty level in the previous game.  Interestingly, hard mode seemed pretty similar to the previous game.  Extreme mode seems all over the place.  I was able to clear ""Melt"" on extreme mode (7.5 stars) on the first try with no real difficulty, but Levan Polka (9 stars) in extreme mode was blisteringly hard!

As with the previous game in the series, there is no shortage of content with plenty of songs to unlock, and a plethora of modules, gadgets, and skins to collect.  Also, if you have save data from the first game you can import it; diva points won't carry over, but items/modules unlocked in the first game will carry over.

In addition, you can now use multiple assist/challenge options during a song.  Some of the familiar options return (continue once if song energy hits zero, eliminate double targets, etc.), but there are some new challenge items to keep even the most veteran players coming back.  For example, you can choose to make all of the notes ""nano-sized"" (which is more challenging than it sounds!), speed up the notes, or have the notes to come from random directions.  Stack a couple of those and you could make for some extreme challenges!

I'd say if you are new to the series, you might consider picking up the first Project Diva F first, but if you've already played that game, then there is no reason not to have its sequel in your game library.  Now it's time to quit writing and get back to the game! If it isn't broken..."

5.0	Having purchased  , MOH 10th Anniversary Allied Assault- Spearhead and Breakthrough- MOH Pacific Assault -MOH Airborne Assault and logging in hours of playing I highly recommend MOH Airborne to all gamers into WW2 shooters. Great storyline well thought out missions exceptional array of weapons and a fairly decent AI adds up to plenty of battling the Italian and German armies.

5.0	"It's an adult game.  Yes.  It's a spoof of the Grindhouse movies of the 70s!  Too many people don't seem to get that.  They buy it expecting a family-friendy shooter experience(!) and get profanity and gore!  No way! ;

Playing it with a friend is a blast and the only negative is the ease of the game.  The hardest part is trying to hit your targets while laughing at the insane comments the characters make.  I found it to be a very funny surprise as I went in with little expectation.  It's one of the few Wii games I've bought and haven't sold or traded in.  People complain that there are no adult games for the Wii, but when they make one like this or MadWorld, people complain it's too violent.  Well, read the box and buy accordingly.

It's a shame so many people give this poor reviews.  I found it to be an over-the-top good time; after all, the word ""overkill"" in the title describes it.  Overkill profanity.  Overkill sexploitation.  Overkill gore. It's hilarious and I'm sorry so many people have no sense of humor"

5.0	"This is a quick review of the game and the contents of the Premium edition. First off, the statue is truly amazing with great detail, I will say that it is made of a little lower quality material than that of the Geralt battling a Griffin statue from the Witcher 3 collectors edition. Also I noticed that the bottom of the statue is not perfectly flat, but I am pleased with the overall quality, it is quite a large statue and highly detailed (see comparison pictures). The artbook is nice and I like that is has the little secret compartment, but it would have been nice to have more detail. The Blackwater vial is nicely detailed and quite heavy with the lid even opening up, however the vial is not hollow, but instead solid. The steel game case is as good as any other. I am a fan of physical content over digital content, but the behind the scenes video was still interesting to watch.

The game is quite fun, after playing many hours in the Witcher 3, it was a good relief to play a game that is focused on the story. I enjoy linear games, so I was excited to finally play The Order. Even though sometimes The Order may have been lacking some extra detail to keep me focused on the story, it does have me wanting more and I cannot wait for the second one to come out. The gun play to me is similar to that of Uncharted or Tomb Raider except for the camera being a bit closer to the character, so you do not get as wide of a view. The only time the letter boxing bothered me was when I was in a close quarters area towards the end of the game and I was trying to get a better view of where the enemy was, so I could sneak around the person or come up from behind. Else, the letter boxing made me feel like I was playing a movie. I know some are saying that not being able to run whenever desired was annoying, which it was some, but many games do that and it did not bother me enough to keep me from being focused on the story. The lycan fights are quite simple and are all the same, but there are not that many, so it did not get too repetitive. The boss fights are not the greatest, since it was not always clear when it was the best time to attack, however,  with the boss fights, I did enjoy that it moved around the room/area that it was taking place and interacted with the surroundings. Most of the quick time events were fun and kept you in the game, but there was a couple times, that it seemed not worth having. I know many people are saying this or that is what current ""next"" gen is, but I do believe The Order deserves some credit considering:

Fast load times
Stunning visual and audio detail for the characters and environment
After it being out for four months, only a 61 Mb update (see picture)
Seamless gameplay to cut scene

I do believe this could be a terrific series with a few simple modifications. I do recommend playing this game, you can always go in on it with a friend, since I personally will maybe play through it one or two more times, just to show friends or to refresh my memory for when the next one comes out. The story is short, but I would rather get an interesting game/story that is short than an uninteresting game that just goes on and on. Overall I am very satisfied with the game and premium edition, especially since I bought it on Prime Day for $40! Premium Edition and Game Review"

5.0	I ordered this game before Christmas,  but I didn't want to do a review until my boys played the game and gave me their opinion. The game was shipped timely. When kids opened the game, it looked great and everything was inside (book & game). Game started up normally. Kids absolutely love playing it!!! Absolutely no issues with the seller!!! KIDS LOVE IT!!!
5.0	This is one of my first Razer products (I also bought their Chroma keyboard) and honestly I thought this company was all about the name. Boy was I wrong. This mouse has PERFECT ergonomics. It feels so nice in the hand. The lighting is really well done. No LED bleed so you don't get light coming out of crevices it's not supposed to. The software used to change the colors and effects is pretty simple and easy to use. On the downside, there are very limited effects you can choose from only being static (solid), cycle colors, and breathing (this option is only available on the logo light, not the scroll wheel). I had hoped for more effects and more customization over the stock ones. The logo is crisp and looks quite nice in low light. All in all, the mouse is fantastic! The software is adequate. I would highly reccomend this to anyone looking for a new gaming/day-to-day mouse. I am now a Razer fan! :) Well done, Razer.
5.0	"I just got and installed my screen protectors. I love that its a 2-pack for a great price. I got them on without too much trouble. I suggest applying them in a very clean room. I got some dust under the first one, but that's my own fault. Just take your time when putting them on. Great product! Will definitely buy again.

UPDATE: These are amazing. I can barely tell they are there. They don't blur the screen at all or interfere with the touch screen either. I didn't expect such a high quality item. I had never bought anything from ICON before, but they have impressed me. I will definitely look to ICON when I am in need for more gaming accessories. Great Screen Protectors"
5.0	"I've been a fan of all the Assassin Creed games, but Black Flag is easily the best game in the series. The traversal mechanics and stealth mechanics are better than in past entries and the setting and narrative are really immersive and enjoyable.

The graphics on my fairly high end PC (GTX 770) are simply breathtaking at times. I have to say that this game is definitely one of the best looking games around. Easily in the top 5 best-looking games on PC. It's pretty demanding, but it's worth it.

All in all this game is extremely fun. I find myself going back to it over and over again even when I am trying to make an effort to finish some other games. It just has such an enjoyable, addictive quality about it. Playing AC4 Black Flag has also made me very excited for the upcoming Assassin's Creed Unity. I can't wait. One of the best games of the year."
5.0	"Nintendogs is a puppy simulator for the Nintendo DS. This is probably the best Nintendo DS game ever! I recommend getting a Nintendo DS just for this game!

There are 3 versions of this game: Chihuahua, Dachshund, and Labrador.

Graphics 10/10 - This game has jaw-dropping graphics! The graphics in this game are the best I've ever seen on a Nintendo DS! The framerate is smooth, which is very good.

Sound Effects 10/10 - This game has awesome sound effects! The dogs sound so realistic!

Visual Effects 10/10 - Great visual effects!

Gameplay 10/10 - This game is the #1 Sim/Stradegy game on the Nintendo DS!

Overall: With 6 breeds in each version, wireless multiplayer abilities (requires 2 DS systems and 2 copies of Nintendogs (any version)), 3-D graphics, ability to train your dog using voice commands, and tons of stuff to do with your dog, this game is a must-have for any Nintendo DS owner!

5 out of 5 stars Nintendogs: Best Nintendo DS Game!"
5.0	Great Graphics! Enjoyed the game Five Stars
5.0	I'm writing this for the free Xbox 360 Games with Gold version that came out a year/ish ago. Great puzzle game that offered a lot of fun. Somehow, despite the boards all being pretty similar, it didn't get old for me! Great, thanks for the free version!
5.0	"Nier: Automata is easily one of the best games of the year. I bought the game, not having played the previous entries on the PS3. I just remember hearing the soundtrack on the trailer of the game and thinking how hauntingly beautiful and epic the score sounded.

One of the best aspects of the game is the gameplay. The game is a hack and slash, very similar to the Devil May Cry or Bayonetta series. One of the more surprising aspect of the game is how you have different types of battles. For example, when you start the game, you're playing a aerial flying mecha style shoot em up. The game switches into a third person action game, and at one point you're playing a side scrolling hack and slash. The variety of game styles that are thrown your way keep the game exciting and fresh.

The story is also fun and interesting. The best part of the game has to be it's MANY endings. Throughout each play through and ending, you get to see the story from different perspectives. The alone made me want to beat the game repeatedly.

The music and sound are TOP-NOTCH! The soundtrack is captivating.

As mentioned before, the replay value is most definitely evident. The game even tells you when you beat it the first time to keep playing it.

All in all, an excellent game. One of the best in 2017.

Final score: 10/10 One of the BEST games of 2017"

5.0	"My 7-year old daughter plays this game on a regular basis. After the usual start-up procedure of guiding her through the game, I'm happy to report that my daughter can turn on her DS and play this game without assistance. Although the game involves some reading, it's appropriate for her reading level and she doesn't seem to struggle at all.

The game has good graphics, and good sound.  The music is quite entertaining. While my daughter plays, I have found myself humming along with the soundtrack -- it is quite catchy.

There are many mini-games within the game, so it's hard to get bored. You're free to explore tricks, training, and mini-games in any order you like, with the goal of increasing your pet's intelligence and affection. With patience, my daughter has steadily increased her pet's stats. The main component of this game is the weekly fashion show, in which you dress your pet and demonstrate its talents in the hope of winning 1st place.

The controls are easy -- I personally think the mini-games are quite fun. At 7, my daughter has been able to master many of the mini-games, and this game does not result in any frustration or outbursts. It's easy enough for anybody to pick-up and play. Great for everybody -- awesome gameplay variety"

5.0	I don't even like the character that much, but I'll be darned if Wario didn't have two solid game series under his belt. This is the first of his adventures so there was a lot to be polished in future titles, but it's definately worth playing if you are a fan of Nintendo platformers. Fun Platformer

5.0	This is the last installment for this batman arkham series. Like the old sequel is batman against the great villains of Gotham city. You have the old gadgets with the addition of the batmobile which is pretty cool to drive, and you can use it to battle. It's best looking batman game and has a good story to finish this drama for batman. Excellent game but very hard one
5.0	"This is the same God of war you played, and loved, on your ps2's. Differences? Even better graphics (yes even greater than back then) and trophies! Esentially this is what you get guys, better graphics and trophies. Is it worth it? You bet it is! It is a great addition to your ps3 collection and the experience is even better than it was on the ps2. If you have the money go for it! And if you never played Gof of war on the ps2...........dont wait any longer and buy this! Very good ""re-make"""
5.0	The remote works perfectly! The grip on the remote feels fine, and it doesn't make my hands cramp up the way some gaming controllers might. All the buttons on it are easily accessible as well. As for the range of connection, it can connect to the GameCube (or Wii) from pretty far away, I've never been in a room large enough to where there was a connection issue. The battery life is also pretty good, I can usually go a couple weeks without needing to change the batteries (and that's saying something, since I can play a ton of video games!) All in all, it's a great remote, and I'd highly recommend this brand to anyone that is looking for a wireless Gamecube remote. Excellent remote with great grip and connectivity!
5.0	"I purchased Call of Duty Black ops about 2 months ago for the PS3 and really enjoyed the play.  I purchased Call of Duty MW3 also and it is a good game too and the game play of each is a little different.  Think of Black ops as war during the 60's and 70's where a man and his gun could do more damage and think of MW3 as ware in the 2000's where you can still take out the enemy with your gun but you have to call in more air support to help.

In any case Black ops is a great game. Note I'm not in to the zombie modes. I've played the campaigns a little but I'm reviewing this from a online multi-player stand point. I like this better than MW3"
5.0	A niceley done remaster, great ps4 controller usage. great ps4 controller usage
5.0	"This is the best Spider-Man game ever made. It's even better than Spider-Man 2 which was so good I've played it for over three years - in fact I was still playing it before Web of Shadows was released.

Web of Shadows takes everything was great about Spider-Man 2 and adds more. The combat is simply incredible. Not only can you engage foes on the ground, but now you can take the fights to the side of buildings, and even into mid air (something I have always wanted to do.)The swinging controls are also good and very smooth. All the controls integrate very well with the Wii-mote and nun chuck.

There are lots of things to do in this game, and although the story mode is a tad short, it's made up for by a large number of side missions. But the main draw here is definitely the combat, and this is something that never gets old. Spider-Man Web of Shadows is the Spider-Man game I've been waiting for all my life. Definitely worth a buy! Unbelievable!"

5.0	"I have tried many controller chargers in the past, and they all seem to do just what they are meant to do, charge the controllers, no magic there.  We all know that we hate to be hooked up physically to the console, and hate the cord rubbing on us all the time we play, so wireless remote and remote chargers are here to stay.
This particular unit is my favorite to day.  The main reasoning for this is that it is very simple to walk up, press the remote gently into the cradle, and walk away, with the PS4 controller light that starts to blink, letting me know it is charging.
To take the remote off, just push back down on it and it pops up, easy to pick up and move on.  My wife was cautious at first when plugging it in, since the first time she pressed the Home button on the remote and caused the system to change menu.  I showed here that in most cases, gripping the remote and pressing the center large area pad, has no harmful effects on the game being played, so no worries there now.
Also, compared to the charger types that have the metal connectors exposed, where you have to align the controller with the metal connector and then plug it in, I have had the connectors break off, there is no worries with this controller charger doing that. Best Charger Ever"
5.0	All right, let's get one thing straight here. This is an official Nintendo Wii U Pro controller-not an off brand or anything. The only difference between this one and the American one is the fact that this one is the Japanese version. All of the instructions are in Japanese and you're unable to register this controller on Club Nintendo due to that fact. However, it's seriously 10 dollars cheaper than buying the American version one-and the only difference is the language the instructions are written in. This Japanese controller worked just fine with my American coded Wii U. All you have to do is sync them up and, ta da! You're done! If you're unable to figure out how to sync a controller to a console, Google always has your back. Works fine with the Wii U, and is 10 dollars cheaper!

5.0	"Super Mario Land 2 is very well done.  You can tell what a difference a few years makes in graphics comparing Super Mario Land 1 to this game.  The game has a nice big world to explore and is much more expansive than SML1.  The game does have that Super Mario Bros feel to it.  One thing that is weird about this game is how high Mario seems to jump in this game.  Every time I play it he seems to hit the ceiling of the screen.  His jumps seem floaty as well and not dead drops like in the classic Super Mario Bros.

The game introduces Wario who is a cool new villain character.  The play control is excellent the castles and bosses are all well done and interesting.  The game is easily one of the best on the original Gameboy system. The games challenge is pretty easy it should only take average players a day or 2 to beat the game.  The game is great for people of all ages and is fun to play.  I would rate it 5 stars.  Even now years after this game has been released it still has a nice replay quality to it.  I would easily let my son or daughter play it.

Gameplay: 10/10
Play Control: 8/10
Story: 8/10
Challenge: 7/10
Replay Factor: 9/10 SML2 is an exciting adventure game for original Gameboy system."
5.0	Out of all the Bomberman games out there that I've played, I'd have to say Bomberman 64 is my most favorite. Don't ask me why...it just is. I rented it out from Blockbuster Video and, liked it so much, that I bought it. I never was a big Bomberman fan til this one came along. I wish I could explain how much fun this game is to play but you'd just have to find out yourself. The Single player mode is challenging but its' Multiplayer mode is where this one shines...yes indeed. Just let me say- I highly recommend this game to all. It's definitely worth its' asking price.... Bomberman 64 is sweet...

5.0	THIS GAME IS UNBELIEVABLE. Of course the game gets better and better every time a new addition comes out, and this one is definitely the best! THe gameplay is incredible. You can play with 40 people, including all the hokages and a few new people! In VS. DUEL, the traditional places are still there, but they look so much better. THere are also three new places: the place where Naruto and Sasuke fought, a grassy, moonlit plain, and a spider forest (Kimimaro)(I think that's it). THe graphics took a big leap from Ultimate Ninja 2. It's so clear and it has a lot more detail from every noodle to every rock in the entire game. There are also a lot of fun things to do, Like in Ultimate Contest, Ultimate Road in UN2, you have much more movement. You can jump on top of building and break things and the missions there give a lot more money and a lot of experience for those characters you like to put on speed and defense high. If you are like me and watch Naruto ahead of the U.S. version or the manga, you might have seen the OVA in which there was a jonin-genin showdown and they had to find these crystals to make a new law for Konoha. THat is what the beginning of Ultimate Contest is for. You MUST be careful here or else your crystals will be taken! This just scratches the surface! Get the game to find out all the things that are too much to review about!!! Get It...You Won't Regret It
5.0	We own both the classic color and the modern color.  When used with Super Mario Maker, this Amiibo provides a large mushroom each time it is tapped on the Wii U game pad, unlike the other Amiibos who, when tapped on the game pad, register that Amiibo with the game for future use.  Each time you want to include the extra large mushroom that turns the player into classic color or modern color Mario, you must tap the Amiibo to the game pad.  It is slightly different then how the other Amiibos are used in Super Mario Maker.  Both colors are well made and a bit on the heavy side compared to most other Amiibos.  If you like the modern color, it is currently only available in a Wii U system bundle in the United States.  Nintendo states that it may be released individually in the future.  The Japanese version is indistinguishable from the U.S. version, except for the packaging.  We were willing to pay $25 to get it now, so that we could use it in Super Mario Maker.  We are very glad we did. Cool Color Option for Mario

5.0	Well, what have we here? Just the best skateboarding game ever! I don't even know where to start, we have really come a long way from the first two. The options are almost limitless, for the create-a-skater and for the whole game. The levels are huge and have so much depth. The one player mode challenges are actually challenging. And the new addition of the revert only serves to make it better. This game is up there with SSX and the other hall-of-famers. I absolutely love this game. And it takes alot to impress me and if your a hard-core gamer I'm sure you feel the same. Bottom line go out and buy this game as soon as you finish reading this. If it's too late and the stores are closed order it from this site because they have a good price for it. Oh yeah and WOLVERINE need I say more? That's it from me. I'm out :) Review of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3
5.0	"Gosh, what can be said about this game that hasn't already been said?

I'll share my first memory of Super Mario Bros. 3. I was young and I heard about this game through the movie, ""The Wizard."" Super Mario Bros. 3 looked highly advanced in terms of graphics in comparison to the two games that came before it, and I knew I had to get it when it came out.

I was a well-behaved child (for the most part) and made sure my parents knew that before its release day. We went to the toy store one day and they bought it for me without question (so behave yourself, kids). We went home, my sister and I played it and invited our neighbor over as well. It was an amazing adventure that gave us lots of retro memories.

 POWER-UPS 
This game may have single-handedly introduced the concept of the power-upthe ability to change your abilities through the use of things like the Super Leaf, Frog suit, and Hammer Brothers' suit, among many others. Imagine never being able to do this before, and suddenly, you can become a statue, jump around in a shoe, or fly forever with the P-Wing! It was mind-blowing at the time. Mind. Blowing.

 LEVELS 
In addition to the power-ups, Super Mario Bros. 3 refined and perfected themed levels. You start with easy Grass Land, and as you progress you get more challenging levels that involve water, ice, and being in the sky. If you hated bottomless pits, then Sky Land absolutely gave you anxiety, and if you were smart, you used the Magic Flute to skip this entire world. Each world has been taken over by one of the Koopa kids, It culminates in a very challenging last dungeon where you face off the main villain of the series: Bowser.

 3DS DOWNLOAD 
This was a much simpler purchase than going through Nintendo's eShop and trying to buy with a credit card. Buy it on Amazon, get a code, redeem it on your 3DS and it downloads quickly for you to start playing.

 SUMMARY 
Somehow, over time, I ended up playingand beating, every level in this game. The level design is amazing, even to this day. The fun (and anxiety) you get is still there. It's easy and challenging, but through it all, it's still a classic fun game. Highly recommended. A Timeless Mario Game, Now Available On 3DS"
5.0	Love it. Five Stars
5.0	Wont take up too much time simply a great game anyone should try. A lot of work goes into this series and it pays off. Amazing game love the detail!
5.0	So since release my friend has been bugging me to get the game and when it was on sale it was the perfect time to buy it and I love the game so much i play almost every day, even though its a subscription type game its worth it. Second MMO i ever played
5.0	This is a fun game with a fun storyline.  A PS2 strategy classic. Five Stars
5.0	good game Five Stars
5.0	Great handheld system. For a while, All I had owned was the nintendo handheld systems like the 3ds. However, there are many cool games for the PSP that the nintendo handheld systems do not have. I bought this instead of the new PS Vita because I had heard all the negative reviews about the Vita. Great handheld system
5.0	This game is great for people that love fast action arcade games... it includes great graphical views and a big selection of guns... don't expect good story or voice acting... the value on this game is on the action and great slow motion killings... u hav to give this game a try!! Incredible Fast Action!!!

5.0	"Every Mega Man title appears to have its own unique quality like the original Mega Man series, The Mega Man X series, and the Mega Man Legends series (Mega Man 64 was a great game even if it was an original port of Mega Man Legends, so don't say it's the worst Mega Man title, just because it's for the Nintendo 64) with rich, high-quality graphics, smooth animations, and addictive gameplay. Mega Man 8 came out perfect when it released on the PlayStation. The 2D graphics were flawless. The animated sprites look cool (Mega Man looks better than before) and the 2D animated worlds look great. The control and playabilty still resembles the old Mega Man series from the SNES. The voice acting is superb (Mega Man's voice matches his character, considering the fact that he looks like a little boy) except for that annoying tutor that tells you continously what to do (you know ! The one that tells you when to jump and when to slide under something). If only there was a code to shut that tutor up by shooting him down. You will see some familiar faces like Mega Man (no-duh ! He's the main character !), Bass (from Mega Man 7), Rush, Protoman, Dr. Light, and the main villain, Dr. Wily. And finally, Mega Man 8 has high-quality anime scenes that describes the story and plot of the game. Capcom is pretty good at doing anime scenes, but can't they make any Mega Man anime series based on all of the Mega Man games ? If only it we're possible. Bah ! Maybe in the future ! With superb, high-quality 2D graphics, cutting edge anime scenes, and breathtaking gameplay, fans of the series might want to waste their money on this game !
Note: There is an import Mega Man game for the Super Famicom (Japanese SNES) called Rockman & Forte (Mega Man & Bass), and it is exactly like Mega Man 8, except for the controls. They're a little slower than that of Mega Man 8's controls (Rockman, or should I say, Mega Man's buster doesn't have any speed. Three shots, then it stops for a second.). It's not really that great, unless you can get used to it. This is the way a Mega Man game should be like !"
5.0	Just when you think the game has reached its climax, BAM!  The plot thickens with a new twist!  It really improves on Gates to Infinity in that now the Pokemon are very diverse, rather than all from Unova as before. The best Pokemon Mystery Dungeon game yet
5.0	Love the game so much fun to play Awesome
5.0	The cable worked exactly as advertised. Some people complain that the plug going into the Wii was a bit tight, but mine plugged in with no hassle. I plugged it into a splitter that went to both my TV and my capture card. Switched the wii to 480p instead of 480i, and the picture does look clearer and the color definition is a lot better. The description should be a bit more clear for this cable however. The Wii only supports 480p, and when they say it can do 1080p they are referring to the Wii U which uses the same cable. I have no way to test this but knowing how cables work I wouldn't see how it would not work. Good for those like me who have a component capture card and want to record Wii games. I also managed to get the cable for only $4.95 with free shipping from a US seller, so be sure to check what all sellers have their's listed for price. This was a steal for the $5 and is worth it. Works perfectly, and low price
5.0	"Very fun game, The boss battles were hard for me so when I finally beat them I felt I had really earned it.

Lots of things to do and a cool storyline. Well worth the 50-60 $$$$ Really fun"
5.0	"I loved this game! Unlike some of the others who criticized this game, I don't mind taking notes when I play a game. I didn't find myself writing down a lot of unnecessary information - mainly what stood out in each of the rooms that were explored and the names and symbols that are needed to solve the final puzzle. By taking my time in each location I really didn't have to run around from place to place. I liked the fact that I had to explore all the little details in each locale and take note of important clues.
The navigation is really easy - just point and click. This is the best type of navigation because it allows the player to take their time. One writer criticized the fact that one has to place the cursor in the correct place to open a door - come on! How hard can that be? Another person said that the puzzles had nothing to do with the story - I think we must have played different games since most of the puzzles reveal the names and symbols that are needed to finish the game. To me that means that the puzzles have everything to do with the story. Another reviewer said that the graphics looked like something from the 1900s. Since this was a ghost story taking place in a hotel from the 1940s, I wasn't bothered by the graphics. In fact the ""grainy"" look made it seem like an old movie or photograph.
I cannot think of a single bad thing to say about this game. It was a great way to spend a Sunday while the rest of the people around here (Door County, Wisconsin) were watching the Packers play football. A perfect game"
5.0	works perfect Five Stars
5.0	This game is cute,  im also glad you don't have to plug the step counter in,  and that you can manually enter it.  I had got a DSi and would be sad if I couldn't use this. Cute

5.0	"Mario and his friends all got driver's license to tear up the track!! Here are the Pros and Cons:
Pros:
1 to 4 player action
8 exclusive characters
Over 40 tracks playable
Each person has different voices and cars
Cool Course Designs
Best items available
Cons:
a little to cute for some
Have to unlock Tracks
Overall- This game is a positive 5 star game with nearly any flaws to this game! Best racing Mario game in GBA!!! ""Racing is on Guys"""
5.0	"Amazing deal. Everything you could want in the game to succeed, however, much like everyone else mentions, by having the Red Bull car it really defeats the challenge of the game.

If you are like me though, you want to enjoy the game for more the the frustration it causes you because you can't hit a corner right or cannot brake in time.

Game overall is aesthetically pleasing and the cars are bountiful. Tracks are scaled to the real ones and the music is decent. Biggest disappointment was the install and update times. The game is huge. Make sure to select the option to install extra/movies to the hard drive, otherwise the loading times are horrible as well.

If you enjoy 'pretty' racing games that require skill and can frustrate you to no end, definitely pick this up. Great deal."
5.0	"Picked these up @ Toys R Us as a little Christmas gift for myself. I probably paid too much, but honestly, the performance is worth it. I spent nearly 10 years on M1 tanks, leaving most of my hearing along the way. Now I do most of my gaming at night, when the kiddos are sleeping and usually I cant hear the game unless its loud enough to piss off my wife. So even though she was pissed I spent 100 bucks on them, that little caveat made it less so.

The speaker quality is INCREDIBLE. As I said my hearing sucks, but with the surround sound in these I can pinpoint a nearby enemy by voice or footsteps and a pivot of the controller. The adjustable bass is rich and warm. The higher ranges clear, even when the bass is hitting.

The quality of the unit is very good as well, with nice textures on the earpads and the outside surfaces of the earphones.  There is  a generous amount cable included too. Even the box is appropriately flashy. The one downside is that the 'limited edition content' consists of some lame ass wallpapers and thats about it.

LOVE them. Totally worth it."
5.0	any ps3 player who loves the racing games will love GT6. Whole new layout in their software on how you choose and select cars, tracks, etc. If you've played BLUR or GRID and liked their style than you'll appreciate GT6's upgrades. GT6 is my Fixx!!
5.0	Awesome and fun game. This series brings back nostalgia. Five Stars
5.0	This game may be a little easy, but the championship mode can provide hours of fun. Ive never seen this much out of a handheld racing game. It leaves all other handheld street racers in the dust. Build and upgrade cars in championship mode, and race for new ones. This game hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves. wonderful, very underated
5.0	I picked this game up on a whim and decided to give it a try. I LOVED this game pressuring people to give testimony, trying to find a flaw in a near-water tight case, and exploring totally random things that would be the most important clue in the end. The only bad thing that can be said about this is that if you hate to use logic and don't have the patience, then it's not for you. When you beat it, there's not reason to replay it again. Also, a few times I knew what I wanted to say, only I couldn't get him to say it. But these are small issuses. Overall, good game to play through, beat, then pat your self on the back because you beat it. If only there were more options...
5.0	I have been a gamer since I was literally 2yrs old. Playing the old Atari 2600 when it was new. And all the other systems that would follow. I still have most of them, and many of the games. Among my collection is Zombies Ate My Neighbors for Sega Genesis. Still fun as hell to play....And still one of my favorite games from the old days of cartridges. You can play 1 or 2 player simulatneously. It's loaded with many levels,odd/funny weapons, & various campy/B movie monsters! Let me just say that although I have played this game a lot....I have yet to beat it. Which is fine, cause that gives me plenty of reason to play it still! I've got up to level 23 & that was challenging. It even has a boss that's a GIANT BABY!!!!! If you love classic/ older games, than this is for you. A must have for zombie lovers (which I am). I have played this on both Sega Genesis & SNES. Either way you are getting a classic! Just classicness......
5.0	I bought this game for my boyfriend. It came in a nice little cardboard case :) He loves the game and the expected date to get it was the 16-18 or something like that and got it on the 13th VERY fast shipping. Thanks for the great game..WOULD highly recommend buying for this person :) Fantastic
5.0	Got it in time to put it under the tree.  Works great, no issues.  Kids are enjoying every bit of it.  And so are we. made our children's christmas
5.0	This will become a classic.  Well done, easily playable, engaging.  The language is sometimes a bit much, but it does fit in with the world. Great game
5.0	I've used these to clean a few NES games, and they work great! They cover a lot more surface on the pins than using q-tips. Would recommend! Way better than q-tips!
5.0	Fun game! Love it.. Five Stars
5.0	Neat Five Stars
5.0	I love the details of this amiibo in particular. Excellent quality. Five Stars
5.0	"I can't even begin to explain how addicted I am to this amazing game.  Is it more of the same?  Sure, but the gameplay is about 10 times better than the original.  The plasmids are better, the shooting is MUCH better, the multiplayer is fun, and the story is still great (although not quite as good as the first one).  I played through the original and finished it the day before I bought Bioshock 2, so I feel the need to make some comparisons...

- You play as a Big Daddy this time (the original prototype), and you definitely feel like one.  When you jump, the ground shakes.  Your default weapon is a huge drill, and (just like the other weapons/plasmids) you can upgrade it for more brutal kills, special powers, etc.  Drilling splicers in the face is AWESOME.  Much better than the wrench from the 1st game.

- The shooting mechanics are MUCH more refined and accurate.  One thing I didn't like about the original Bioshock was the shooting with the default pistol and machine gun.  No matter how much I upgraded them, they still didn't feel incredibly accurate.  The rivet gun in Bioshock 2 is really the default firearm, and it's incredibly satisfying to shoot.

- The hacking (which I rarely attempted in the first game) is so much better, but still requires good timing.  You basically get a meter with a needle that goes back and forth, and you need to stop the needle in the green or blue sections.  In Bioshock 2, I'm addicted to hacking every camera, turret, and vending machine I can find.  It's a fun little mini game.

- You still have the choice to harvest or rescue Little Sisters, but if you rescue them, you need to find a corpse that contains Adam and protect the Little Sister while she gathers it.  Splicers will start attacking very aggressively from all sides, so this is always a challenging (and fun) experience.

- The enviroments are larger and there's more action taking place, but the graphical quality overall seemed to take a hit.  The textures are quite blurry up close, which isn't something I noticed in Bioshock 1.  Nothing looks really bad; it's still a beautiful game, but not quite as ""rich"" in color/textures as the 1st game.  Speaking of environments, you can't freely travel between areas anymore.  You can still explore the individual areas as much as you like (and there's quite a bit more exploration this time, and more items to find), but you can't go back to levels you visited earlier.  Thankfully, the levels still feel very open and not linear at all, so you'll never really notice the corners they cut.  The splicers also look odd this time, I don't really know why.  They don't look quite as 3D or something.  They have this weird ""faded"" look, like the color pallette isn't quite as rich or as dark.  I thought they were supposed to look more mutated, but they seem to resemble humans from my prespective.  I know this isn't a big deal, but it's just something I noticed...

- Multiplayer isn't anything revolutionary, but there are interesting takes on old concepts (i.e. instead of capture the flag, it's capture the Little Sister).  It's still lots of fun and I haven't encountered much lag.

Overall, this was a great experience.  It's true that the city of Rapture isn't as interesting as it was the first time, and the story didn't quite measure up to the original, but it's still a genuinely creepy and beautifully stylized place to visit.  The improvements to the gameplay mechanics are very welcome and really make this a blast to play for fans of the FPS genre, but gamers who like to explore large enviromnents and collect items will also find a lot to like here. Pure greatness for fans of the original"
5.0	"I liked the survival horror they brought into gaming.
I think more zombie games stemmed from this because of its notable success.
My favorite part was 8-player versus - a competitive mode where player controlled human survivors are pitted against player controlled ""hero"" zombies. I would play as zombies all the time if i could, but each team of players gets to play as both survivor and infected on each stage of the level and victory is awarded to the team that collectively gets the farthest whilst playing as survivors.

If you thought this was good, left 4 dead 2 is even better. Great game"
5.0	first was better Five Stars
5.0	"This game is simply a blast. I am amazed that a PSP game is this good. As some people have mentioned, there are some loading issues, but they are not frequent and do not detract from the game. The control is very good, the force powers feel great. I say feel because it really does feel like you are wreaking some serious damage with the force!

The story is great, acting is great.

The extra stuff like the historic missions and the force duel modes, are great and are not found in the console versions. Lots of replay value here. There is multiplayer, but it is ad-hoc only, no infrastructure. However SONY has something in the works called Ad-hoc party, where if you have a PS3, you can use it to bridge over and play ad-hoc over the internet/infrastructure. So it will be some day soon.

A must buy for any PSP owner, very addictive game! The force is strong with this one"

5.0	"Who would've thought that the Donkey Kong series which started out as an ""ape throwing barrels at people"" game would turn into a full scale, 5 star, action/adventure extravaganza??? Donkey Country had it all. Flawless, clean and sometimes breath taking graphics and effects to complement the endless arrays of level by level challenge and outstanding game play.
The many bonus levels intrigued you and challenged you to be your best. The animal companions gave you an extra incentive to play because the Swordfish, the Rhino and the Frog made it that much better and that much fun.
The other thing that really revolutionized action/adventure type games was Donky Kong Country's boards and levels because none were exactly the same. Each board had it's individual quirks and perks and each board gave you that needed challenge that other action/adventure type games lacked at the time.
You could not put this game down. Me, personally, after 8 months after this game's release, I was still playing it because it was still that good (that and I was determined to play a perfect game and clear all the boards including the bonus levels).
This was the first installment of the newly revived series and it was a MUST NEED and still is. I would definately recommend this series to anyone and for those of us Triple Crowners (own the PS2, X-Box and Gamecube), I would definately stop all of the other games I was doing when the next installment of the Donky Kong series came to the home system. But for now, get this one and play the hell out of it! Donky Kong rules!"
5.0	My son loves it! Five Stars
5.0	ecxellent Five Stars
5.0	I play these games to exercise my brain along with various others. If you like Hidden Object games but it.  There is still a lot to play even after you finish with the story line., It's a cool game
5.0	"Everyone at the first sight consider it's a Diablo like RPG but it's totally different. I'd rather treat it like 2.5D skyrim or wildhunt.
If you have no patience to explore the world, this game is not for you!
The battle is full of fun with strategy.
For most AAA RPGs in 2014 and 2015, they told you to do something/get some stuff/from A to B, then to C. But for this game, you need to decide which way you should do to complete B, because the result of B will influence A and C.
For example, a goblin tells you to murder an orc woman, bring her necklace back. You can kill the goblin, and tell the truth to the orc woman, you can kill the orc woman, and bring the necklace to goblin, you can also say hello to the orc woman, steal her necklace to the goblin and promise you have killed the woman! If you really kill the woman then another quest you need to get some knowledge and ideas to make a show at the town will be influenced...
So, it all depends on your choice! You can give the quest keys to the npc and after finish the quest, steal from them to open the treasure chest, if you find a drunk legion solder and search his inventory, there must be a mug with beer! You can make tomato sauce with tomato and hammer!  This game has so much amazing details to explore...Lot's of puzzles and jokes.

I can't wait for the DOS 2 release. This game is fantastic old school cRPG in decades!"
5.0	"I originally purchased the regular edition of Halo 3 when it released. Now I had the chance
to purchase the collectors edition and I am so glad I did. The essentials disc was such an awesome dvd
to have as well as the book and big tin that it came in! Such a great product for a collector like myself to have! Mssed Opportunity No More"
5.0	"First off, I mean what I'm saying in the heading.  You can play the game with a keyboard, but you're virtually guarenteed to have a better time using a controller.  You'll want a corded x-box 360 controller or I was using the Logicitec one.  In any case, you need support for xinput and not directinput like an old controller you might have laying around.  The other thing, this game is jumpy at times even with a Geforce GT 240.  That's not to say it's unplayable, but at times it would inexplicably sort of stall.  The game was still entirely playable and it wasn't a big deal, but just don't expect to play it on a really low end card or a laptop; that's probably not going to work.

I never played the full first Alice game back in the day, only the demo, but I had fond memories of it.  At it's heart Alice 2 is an old style platformer.  That made me very nervous.  Yeah, if we're old enough, we all remember being brutalized by 16-bit games that were just plain jerks with some of the jumping.  My only concern when buying Alice was that it was going to be obnoxious.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The jumping puzzles can be a little difficult at times, but never got into feeling like punishment.  It also was quite good about not having a check point too far back.

Even without artificially extending the game play with annoyances, the game manages to be maybe 13 hours long if you take your time, less if you don't hunt down much.  You can really fly through faster if you want to ignore the teeth to get weapons upgrades, but you'll make it a little harder on yourself later on.  There's also a lot of collectable stuff you can grab, but I didn't really care about it.  The game is not especially hard and will (sometimes literally) draw an arrow to point you where you need to go.  This is good in a way, since I really hate getting lost, but it's also done a little too much at times and you'll be wondering who they though was going to need this or that explained to them so late in the game.

The combat was fun and the weapons varied and useful.  You have to flip between things pretty fast at times, so if you are using a mouse and keyboard you hopefully have a mutant hand stuck out of your side to help press buttons faster.  For example, you have to be in ""lock on"" mode to deflect projectiles back at enemies, but you cannot jump while in the mode.  So you may be going back and forth between modes to battle effectively.  This is good, however the single weakest point in my mind is the lock on system.  It's criminally bad in some places and when you're facing a large number of characters it adds a tremendous frustration when you're looking right at the enemy you want to lock on to and instead it picks someone else and flips your view, and is just maddening.  It's bad, really bad at times, but still doesn't ruin the game.  Just a major irritation.

One other thing I should note.  EA in their typical ""shoot yourself in the foot"" approach to protecting their software implemented a poorly coded DRM scheme that may prevent you from playing.  If you redeemed the game on Steam and get a message that the game is ""tampered with"" and it won't start, and verifying the game cache doesn't help, you may need to set an exception in your antivirus to ignore the executable (it's located in a sub folder under a folder named binaries in the game directory).  I had to do that with BitDefender and then the game started up and ran just fine.  It's a sign of sloppy code I've seen before, but at least the game played.  In BitDefender 2013 at least, look up how to ""exclude a process"" on Google and you should be all set. Suggest A Controller & A Good Graphics Card"
5.0	This shows how great the PS3 is, even if your disk drive goes to hell, you can still digitally download full games via the Playstation Network! Oh the greatness of PS3!!! Even without the disc drive!
5.0	I had doubts when I bought this game, I thought it would not be as good as X and Y. I was wrong, changing gym battles to island challenges was a great idea and makes the series feel new. I beat the game in 2 days, but was playing for 3 weeks after with all the things you can do after the championship battle. Makes Pokemon Feel New

5.0	"From the beginning, the Assassin's Creed series has been a love it or hate it affair. I've been hooked on this series since the first game, which had some trying controls, but the series only got better with each release. The story is over the top, and at times a bit hard to follow, but the game has always been fun.

Assassin's Creed Revelations builds on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. It gives you more of what you're used to, and of course the parkour, which is the signature feature of the series. If you don't like the parkour element of this game, you're not going to like it. Period! I have read a lot of reviewers complaining about the lack of something new, but I'm curious what is the new that they want? Until last year, Assassin's Creed was single player and story driven. While they added multiplayer, I judge this game on it's single player story alone since that's what Assassin's Creed is all about to me. Assassin's Creed Revelations is a story driven game and it's more complex than ever before.

In this iteration of the series you will be interwoven into experiences with Desmond, Ezio, and Altair. This game ties up loose ends related to those three characters and opens the door to more characters in the future, some exciting news to Assassin's Creed fans.

If you're expecting a lot to be different, it's just not there. The story advances, the setting changes, and some gameplay elements change, such as a tower defense mode within the game. Now, instead of just taking over enemy strongholds, they can try to take them back. Ubisoft also remapped the controls so that accessing weapons is easier than it's every been.

If you're an Assassin's Creed fan you will not be disappointed. If you're just jumping into the series, you shouldn't start here, you should start with the first Assassin's Creed. You'll appreciate the progression over time and become engrossed in the story in a way that you just can't be if you start here. Assassin's Creed Fans Will Love It"
5.0	Excelent Five Stars
5.0	The story and interaction of this game were revolutionary. So much in fact that I haven't enjoyed a single-player COD campaign as much since. For some reason I didn't like the online aspect as much though. But this game is a HOF member and is worthy of your money. Best campaign of them all.
5.0	This game is a deluxe remake of the original Double Dragon. It includes more than a dozen moves with which to pummel foes with, and also new levels and enemies to brawl with therein. The music, controls, and overall quality is top-notch for this GBA title. Why are you still reading this review? GET IT! Best rendition of the original Lee bros. so far!

5.0	I love Level 5! They were the people who brought me Dark Cloud 2 and for that, they will always hold a special place in my heart. White Knight plays like an MMO and has a fairly engaging story. I really like that you can make your own character and have them play a role in the game's story. I wish they would let me make my own knight in this game, but they added it later in White Knight 2. Level 5 Makes Great Games
5.0	Just thought I would write a few words about this game because it is freaking awesome! I still ain't done with it, but I am having a blast! It's really addictive trying to fuse stronger demons! And the game is pretty challenging! The music is also really, really good. I'm not done with it yet, but I doubt that I will ever get tired of this game. And the 30 dollar eShop credit for buying this and Fire Emblem Awakening is just great. Great game!
5.0	lookin for a rpg? this is the game for you. filled with many hours of gameplay to find all the hidden items. casual gameplay, unless you try to collect everything, then it's hardcore. good controls and challenging puzzels give this game its rateing. AMazING
5.0	"my son like this product.
He played on his nintendo WII with his friends.
They stated it was so fantastic. games"
5.0	I didn't run out and get it when the game first rolled out. Instead I waited until it was out for about 8 months or so. I like it a lot and would recommend it to other gamers as well. There are still some things I think the developers should address but as far as subscription games go this one is a lot more fun and challenging than the major market games that have been dumbed down to the point of boredom. Tera has a chance to be better but I only hope there are enough people still playing to warrant the investment by the developers. Original Gameplay

5.0	"Lately, the Mario series has been met with a couple&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/creatively/dp/B0088MVPFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">creatively</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/bankrupt/dp/B00CQ7CIMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">bankrupt</a>&nbsp;titles, leaving me to worry about the series's future a bit. However, those were just New Super Mario Bros. installments. Games like Super Mario 3D World show that THIS is where the effort is REALLY poured into! Super Mario 3D World is supposed to be the sequel to 2011's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-3D-Land/dp/B002I092MM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario 3D Land</a>&nbsp;for, well, the Nintendo 3DS.
That's one thing that had me concerned during the first time the game was revealed. It's no doubt people were unimpressed at first, because it initially looked like a 3D Land rehash, and was not the super-rad 3D Mario platformer continuing in the structures of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mario-64/dp/B00000F1GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mario 64</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine/dp/B000066JRN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxy-1/dp/B000FQ9QVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxy 1</a>&nbsp;& 2.

Honestly, though? I'm perfectly fine with this game.

What Super Mario 3D World lacks in feeling like a successor to Galaxy, it makes up for in literally EVERYTHING ELSE! Nearly every single level in the game offers something new to the table, whether it be a new enemy, toy to play around with, or interesting and completely interactive scenery. One world in the game features more creativity and imagination than the New Super Mario series as a whole!!

I mean, seriously. There's a level where you're on a speeding train, a level where you watch your shadows, a level taking place in an ancient city, a maze-like level with switch-like pads on the ground, a level where you use a Piranha Plant to eat other enemies, a level or few where you ride on a cute sea creature's back.....I could go on and on here. It's just absolutely fantastic.

Oh yeah, get this - Peach isn't kidnapped here! Instead, you're saving fairies that are a lot like that of the ones in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Bros-2/dp/B00004SVV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>. And like that game, you get to choose from four different characters, each with their own abilities. Mario's average, Luigi jumps higher, Toad is quicker, and Peach glides (There's also a ""secret"" fifth character reappearing from Mario Galaxy). I love seeing Peach finally getting in on the action after so many years of saving her, and seeing her and Toad shoot fireballs and using the Cat Suit makes me smile.

The game also lets you play with 2 to 4 other players. I'm pretty sure it was already chaotic enough to have to try and fight through the New Super Mario Bros. console games with your friends! But you know what? The chaos the multiplayer brings has always been great fun, regardless of whether or not you actually make progress. Plus, it's about time a 3D Mario game incorporated a legitimate multiplayer mode. I played through a majority of the main game with my two brothers, and things got crazy in the best way possible!

If you're actually progressing through the game (Obviously best done in single-player), you may come across the fact that you will need to collect Green Stars to be able to enter various levels in the game. If you're familiar with collecting Yoshi Coins in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-World/dp/B00002STXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario World</a>, or the Star Medals in 3D Land, then this is familiar territory. The Green Stars are hidden around every level,  and you can earn more by playing unique puzzle levels where you navigate Captain Toad to collect all of them, or by entering a series of challenges via the Mystery Boxes found on the map.
I remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-Lost-World/dp/B00D41GCVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic Lost World</a>&nbsp;had a feature like this, where you had to rescue amounts of animals to move on certain areas, but the problem in that game was that the amounts required were usually excessive, which meant you had to backtrack at least a little bit. Here, in Mario's case, it's not anywhere as annoying because there's so many alternative paths to take or unexplored levels still waiting to be played. You won't have to play a single level you already played. That is, unless you really want to dig deeper and deeper into the game to unlock even more levels, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.

If there's anything I have to remotely complain about in Super Mario 3D World, it's...not really in the game itself, but rather Luigi Bros. Luigi Bros. is a version of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NES-port-of-the-Mario-Bros-arcade-game/dp/B000E99JN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NES port of the Mario Bros. arcade game</a>&nbsp;that serves as unlockable content (or if you have New Super Luigi U, you could already unlock it). Thing is - Luigi Bros. is literally just Mario Bros. except with two Luigis. Nothing else is different, which is rather disappointing.

Super Mario 3D World is not exactly what I'd consider to be better than the 3D Mario games that preceded it (except for 3D Land), but those games have set the bar tremendously high, and this game is still one of the best Wii U games around, as well as the best Mario game since Galaxy. If you're a video game fan at all, you need to experience this game at..at least some point in your life. It can't go without saying that it's loads of fun. Mario's BACK, baby!!!"

5.0	Thank you for your business. The product was just what I wanted. Five Stars
5.0	This is an expensive Video Game, in order to beat the game you need to have a minimum one character per element type, there Water, Fire, Earth (Life), Wind, Magic, Undead and Tech, when all said and done with you want to experience every bit of content in the game you have to collect the entire collection, with Spyros adventure and Giants that is over 100 characters, and now there is a 3 game coming out in the fall with additional pieces to collect. Part of the thrill of the game is collecting all the characters  With all that said I love the game, I am addicted to it 
5.0	Great Five Stars
5.0	This game will definitely be in the list for Game of the year.  This is a classic that no one must ignore.  It is like playing a 5 star movie.  Im not a big comic book fan but this game has made me a Batman fan. A CLASSIC
5.0	Just what he wanted Five Stars
5.0	Plugged it in and it works like a charm. The cable was around $11 and more than long enough to make the connection between my TV and PS3. Great cable
5.0	Too much fun! Five Stars
5.0	"Nintendo's Wii Remote has proved to be quite the revolutionary thing. It provided a new and fresh experience, and, with the help of Wii Sport, sold the Wii to millions of homes. It has an Infrared Pointer, motion sensing accelerometers, and a mini speaker on the front. The Wiimote has since been proven as a flashlight, a light saber, a katana, a steering wheel, a gun, etc.

Now what you get in this neat $50 package is one black Wiimote along with a black newly redesigned ""vest"", ""jacket"", ""sleeve"", or ""condom"" for use with the stock Wiimote (sans Wii Motion Plus). You also get a black Wii Motion Plus device and a redesigned jacket for use with the Wiimote and the Motion Plus.

The Wii Motion plus addition here is a big deal for several reasons. First of all, is the fact that this device has a stand alone price of $20, and when combined with the stand alone Wiimote ($40), you end up paying $10 more than what you would have you bought this combo pack. Second, is that Wiimotion Plus has become a new standard for several games, and more are being made all the time. Said games will REQUIRE motion plus to play, so you might as well get it now.

Several games that require or are enhanced with WIIMotion Plus are
-Wii Sports Resort
-Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10
-Grand Slam Tennis
-Red Steel 2

One of the first things people will notice about this new remote is obviously the color. Nintendo has swapped the sleek iPod inspired white for a very sexy black. The buttons have remained the same color (red for power, blue for Home), but those match very fluidly with the new black exterior.

The functionality is the same, there are no new features, no noticeable improvements, at least on the technical side. The actual plastic material has been changed though, for the better. The top side remains with a glossy finish, but the underside, instead of mere plastic, there is now a very nice matte finish. It provides a better grip, and you'll find yourself with less sweaty hands. (note that this may be case with new White Wiimotes as well, but this is the first Wiimote ive bought in 2 years, so i wouldn't know).

All in all, im very happy with my purchase. You get a Wiimote, WM+, and two ""jackets"" for just $50. You save some cash, and bag the WM+ that will be eventually needed. A better Wii Remote experience."
5.0	Good for the spidey fan Five Stars
5.0	I love playing this game so much. Showing off on other teams makes NFL Street 3 get 5 stars. Am still learning how to master the game but its still good I can just pick up my PSP and jump right into a game. I have my own team that I created on respect the street mode. Get this game. It dose not matter if you are 6 years old or over 20. If you are a big football fan then buy this game. Am giving it a good review. (5 Stars) I just cant get enough
5.0	Fast shipping. All is awesome in the world. Wewt!
5.0	Call.of duty as been on top for many year and this is just authored great game. The story mode I enjoyed a lot, the multiplier I realignment play much but the extinction mode I really liked I spent hours just playing this mode and now I'm waiting for the DLC which includes a new extinction map. Overall not a bad game and for $49 it was a good price especially for a next gen. System not bad
5.0	I got these today and though I was surprised to get the packaging all in Japanese, they were very easy to put on without needing instructions and are so clear I can't even tell they're there, which is great. I used someone's suggestion to use a credit card to get them on without air bubbles and it worked perfect. Simply peel off the back, lightly put it over the screen, and used the edge of the card to press and smooth it down. Took less than five minutes to apply both. Very worth it! Great protectors
5.0	"To be honest some people may jump to horrible comparisons when they start to play Driv3r because... IT DOES NOT PLAY LIKE GTA or they experience some minor bugs! Yes there are those of you out there who will have to learn that the triangle button does not get you in and out off cars, that Tanner jumps a bit odd, that there are some game crashes, glitches and moments when things don't happen quite like they should... yet with A.I this sophisticated, with so many possibilities because of the highly detailed and semi-destructible environments and certainly destructible vehicles - that to tune this game to perfection would probably mean waiting for the PS3 to come out. There is no doubt - no other game has pushed the limits of a gaming experience like Driv3r. The Getaway had similar problems on release with its glitches but Driv3r is nothing like that horrible experience and is more akin to that cherry you got popped when you stuck the Vice City disk into the machine (as if VC did not have some glitches too). Also please remember that if it was not for Driver 1 + 2 we would not have had the 3D GTA series. GTA 3D was spawned by the Driver series. Div3r has now taken the lead. It deserves it too.
There are 3 full scale cities (Miami, Nice and Istanbul - all WOW! WOW! BIG WOW!). Tanner has a choice of several weapons including a rocket launcher that virtually blows up everything except some buildings. There are, however, no sniper riffles! I can maybe understand why games this realistic do not have sniper riffles but my only real crib with this game is that is has no zooms. A pair of binoculars with a zoom feature would not have gone amiss! Tanner can swim! So no more drowning deaths! The vehicle destruction systems and world physics in this game are as good as they will get on the PS2. When this thing hits the PC it will probably be awesome. The driving is as realistic as Grand Turismo and is not too far away from matching the graphics found in Need for Speed: Underground. There is a cool slow motion ""fun"" feature in the controller (L1+R1) that allows you to see crashes in slow-mo while still driving. There is very little blood in the game but that does not make it any less violent. The shootouts with the cops after a chase are first rate action sequences. Unlike Vice City everything comes out of the blue and you will not second guess a thing. The A.I is that good.
The replay and director mode are sublime. With Driver 1 + 2 you have spent hours creating endless little movies. If you liked that experience Driv3r will have you doing a recreation of the Steve McQueen Bullet car chase sequence in no time. Every conceivable camera angle and tracking shots are covered (with controllable cinematic motion blur!... Hell yeah!)
The story is great and requires you to think about it a little. It basically revolves around a car heist gang and you work with foreign cops undercover to expose the ring. The cut sequences are almost film quality CGI and voiced by major Hollywood actors. The missions themselves are each compelling, entertaining and present a level of realistic quality not seen before. This is as close as it gets to playing a movie. The free ride mode of course will allow you everlasting driving and mayhem across the 3 cities for the price of $50. You can also play various type chase/getaway/cross country/point to point/ scenarios.

It has NO multiplayer which is a shame. I have wondered why they did not do this but then again this may be a problem with the PS2 engine. It is my understanding that Vice City programmers could not do it either. I doubt we will ever see a 2 player game this rich in detail and game physics without better technology (In Grand Turismo you went around circuits and things did not blow up! and there where no cop chases and shootouts). Now and again the PS2 does stall at times even in the only single player mode. There is also no stats page like in GTA.
There are tons of missions and you will spend a few days at them.... relentlessly. I can not quarrel about any of the little glitches that crop up now and again. To be honest the more I learned to control the game the less the glitches appeared (come on folks, they only happen now and again when you start learning the game). In fact I have not found a glitch in quite a long time (playing now 70 hours + for sure). The bottom line is that this is an evolution in gaming experience and possibly the human condition. Nothing will be the same after playing Driv3r.
Pros:
- The BEST game ever for the PS2. Better than Vice City.
- Graphics are the best in any game for the PS2 so far. 3 gloriously rendered cities to do battle with.
- The driving IS Grand Turismo.
- The slo-mo fun feature is whacked out!
- The shootouts and destruction on this scale and realism have not been seen before.
- You can do virtually anything you want in the game.
- The A.I is outstanding.
- The car crash physics are like something NASA came up with.
Cons:
- Some glitches (jumping and control problems, going through walls sometimes, odd game crash).
- Requires a greater deal of practice than you think before you fully come to grips with the Driv3r experience.
- The shooting system may not be to everyone's style.
- Character movement may appear sluggish at times (yet during playback it looks extremely realistic).
- The height of realism impacts the cartoonish quality that GTA has.
- You will die quicker in this game because you can be injured while driving. This is a full review of Driv3r (I have completed the game)."
5.0	It's great that they take wars from back in the day and make into a video game it give this young generation a history lesson. Even if it's bloody violent I say it has to be that the only way a game can get their attention. Gory bloody games is what out today. This Vietnam has great graphics and good sound you can move all around the board which means more adventure. good game for the new generation

5.0	"This mouse is a really good mouse, and they are practically giving them away at around 15 dollars. I encourage you, if you are on the fence, to just buy it. It looks really awesome, much better than in the pictures. Build quality seems good. Note: Some other review mentioned the scroll wheel being ""soft"", and while it is, it is not noticable at all. It is exactly what you would want when gaming. Equal to a Razer DeathAdder"
5.0	excelente Five Stars
5.0	"I have been a fan of Naruto series for many years and I own all three previous titles of ultimate storm series: 1, 2 and generation. This one is closet to the second title in terms of free roaming: there is a little map on top of the screen and you just follow the arrow. Since I know the story line pretty well already, I skipped quite a lot of cut-scenes, but these are some great cinematic views. I haven't finished the game but the Kyuubi fight is awesome (both with third hokage and naruto), and this is NOT included in any of the previous ultimate storm releases. I am pretty sure many of those who buy this game are very familiar with the anime and manga, but if not, don't buy it, play the first and second one first. Well it sucks for 360 owners that first title is released only on PS3, but at least play the second one.

I can't wait till I get to Sage mode Kabuto fight. Must own for Naruto fans"

5.0	Look at the additional pictures (the ones with the Legend of Zelda 3ds xl) to get a better idea of what this is. It's not as transparent as the pictures elude to, and there's a 3DS XL box logo on the front by the 3D cameras. It gave mine a slight frosty look (see my pictures). I would have liked a completely clear case, but it's too fine of a detail to complain about. It fits extremely well, leaving ample room for stylus, game cart, SD and charger. I don't know if it'll fit in the XL charging cradle (I don't own one), but it looks like it might. either way, you could easily add decal in between the case and system to further decorate it. Cool case, definitely worth the price. Looked far better quality than the eForCity version. Not too large, Fit's well, Quality material, but Not as transparent as it looks in the ad.
5.0	It came in good condition works perfectly thanks Five Stars
5.0	Unique game, wish they would do a sequel. It's dropped in price lately here on Amazon, so pick it up. Unique game, wish they would do a sequel. ...
5.0	"I did a lot of research on this before picking one up, both online and with my gaming friends. Just about everyone said it kept your system cool, a few complained about fan noise and a few of my personal friends said after a while their system would lock up eventually with the intercooler installed. I figured it was worth a shot.

I'm happy I went for it. It makes a huge difference in heat. I can play GRAW for hours and the case is just barely warm in the center. Before I had the intercooler the whole case would be overly-warm to the point that I worried about it. The intercooler totally resolved that issue.

It IS a bit on the noisy side but I'll take a little noise to extend the life of my 360. I havn't had any lockup issues or anything else negative. I have heard it's a snug fit with the wireless adapter but I use a wired connection so I don't have to deal with that.

I think the best part is it's just a matter of snapping it on and off the xbox and it doesn't void the warranty so it's the perfect cooling solution. Great Product"
5.0	It's good ms pac man is chomping into our hearts because she nice It's good
5.0	This game takes me back, but there is a lot of new levels in this one. The game is easy to get addicted to just like the original one. For everyone saying Dante looks different, I'm not sure why. You can select his style, including the more familiar long white haired Dante from the other games. If you do select that one, though, you'll kind of miss the point of the story progression as Dante ' s look does change over the course of the game. In short, if you loved Devil May Cry before, you will love this one even more. What an amazing remake... lots of extras and surprises.
5.0	very good buy Five Stars
5.0	I have practically forgotten about every other game in my collection, to play this game. Five Stars
5.0	This was my 1st game on PS2. And i played it till it didn't work anymore. if you want to really enjoy this game, find the cheat code and have at it. lol. Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories
5.0	"Absolutely love this PS Vita. I have owned a PSP, 3DSXL, Gameboy and Gameboy Advance  - this one is definitely a PSP on roids. Very elegant

The screen is amazing - large and clear (I did not see the original one with the OLED so cannot compare)
The button placement and sizes are perfect for a handheld, it fits well in your hands, although I would recommend the Comfort Grip accessories if you were planning on playing for a long time in one setting (my thumbs get a little sore without one)
Both the front and back touch screens are responsive and crisp
Sound is not out of this world, but definitely on par.

My only complaint about this is the Wifi - it does lose connection every so often even though it will show Full bars and 90% connectivity and I can be right next to my router. My 3DS never had this problem or any of my other wireless devices. It happens intermittently, but that's too often if you play online a lot (I do not).

OK - one other complaint - the Proprietary memory card nonsense - Sony decided to go this route like the PSP, unfortunately - there are no adapters that I have found that allow you to use regular micro SD cards in this like the PSP had (eventually).
Speaking of memory cards - don't forget one - I would suggest at least a 16GB one (about $30-35) to be safe - unless you like to download a lot and keep in on there - then go the 32GB route.

Runs my PSOne classics from the PSN flawlessly and I actually prefer to play them on this than my PS3 (actually why I bought it).
The game sizes (physical size) are perfect for portability.
The games look amazing on this screen and no need to fire up the big boy TV or shut everything down when done - just hit the power button and put in standby, pickup where you left off  in an instant.

Accessories:
I would definitely recommend the Vita Vault Case if you are into protection/storage - both Best Buy and Amazon sell it for  around $20, Gamestop for about $25. I think even Target carries it in certain places.
Screen protector would be a good investment too to protect that gorgeous screen
Trigger comfort grips are a plus too.

If you ever had a PSP and wanted to upgrade or are looking for a handheld that can play retro games, but also the current genre, this is the route to go.
Battery life rocks - very important nowadays.

Would definitely recommend Awesome handheld piece of machinery - don't forget a memory card!"
5.0	I absolutely LOVE Wind Waker. The copy I received was in excellent condition and I have already completed the game three times lol. I highly recommend this game! love it!!
5.0	"Recently on G4 Tech TV I was watching ""Filter"", and they were counting down the top 10 underrated games of all time, and to my amazement and joy, Vagrant Story was rated the #1 most underrated game ever. There could be no title more worthy, and it saddens me that it has a 4 star average here on Amazon, though it's not really suprising.

Vagrant Story was one of the final Square games to come out for the PS1, and went by almost unnoticed. I didn't actually play it until it was a couple of years old. The graphics are without doubt some of the best ever seen on the PS1. I wish we could have had voice overs in this game, but such things were still pretty uncommon on the PS1. The sound is very good, light on music and heavy on creepy, atmospheric sound effects that really enhance the feeling of being lost in the huge mazes of buildings, tunnels, and dungeons.

As it is, the dialogue is absolutely exceptional, and the story is complex, twisting, and really makes you think. Good and evil end up not being quite what you think they are. The story has a heavy emphasis on a religious, crusader/inquisition type group of characters, as well as incorporating sorcery and magic. I could never explain how great the story and characters of this game are...it's just magical. The world just sucks you in.

The entire game takes place in an old abandoned ghost town on an island called Lea Monde. It is one of the most phenomenal environments ever created for a game. Much of the game takes place underground in old tunnels, vaults, caves, storage areas, and a huge variety of buried rooms, but there are also many areas where you emerge and have to explore the city aboveground. The feeling of the game is very lonely, and the old abandoned town of Lea Monde is amazing to explore.

The amount of detail that was put into this game is just incredible, and it is evident at every moment just what a labor of love it was for those who made it. Not only is the game itself exceptional, but the plethora of details they incorporated makes it an all time classic. For example, on the map screen, every single room in the game (and there are a lot) has it's own unique name. There is one dungeon where every room (and there are at least 30) is named after an implement of torture! It's just great.

There is a huge variety of enemies, and an in game encyclopedia that fills up as you encounter them. Combat is very difficult, and it seemed to me at first even too difficult, but once you get the hang of it, this game has one of the most fun, and definitely most unique, combat systems ever devised. With each swing you take, you can choose where to aim on the enemy (left or right arm, legs, body, or head!), and depending on the enemy, armor, and what type of weapon you are using, you will have a different %chance of hit and damage. There are about 6 or 7 types of weapons (blunt, piercing, slashing, etc.) and a HUGE variety of different weapons within these categories. Within this there are different gems that can be attached to your weapons to make them more efficient against certain types of enemies, give them elemental attributes, etc.

Truly, this game has an almost intimidating amount of detail, but that's what makes it so great. You can armor all parts of your body, and every single weapon and every single piece of armor is customizable by combining lesser weapons and armor in workshops that can be found among Lea Monde. Materials range from course materials like wood and iron early in the game to silver and platinum materials later. Weapons have to be created and specialized in for different creature types. For example, I usually had a spear I used against dragons, a holy mace and a holy dagger for undead and zombies, and an axe that was most effiecent against humanoid creatures. Plus, you can actually name every weapon you create, which adds an awesome finishing touch to your arsenal.

There is so much about this game that is great that I could go on for another hour and hardly scratch the surface. This game is thought provoking, its deep, and it is CHALLENGING. Not for wimps! There is so much to explore, so many hidden features, such endless customization, this game just never gets old. And, it has a new game plus feature, so you can replay it with all the skills, equipment, and magic you've acquired. Damn, I didn't even touch on the magic...there is a huge variety of magic spells you can learn as well!

I've played through it probably 3 times over the past few years, and it remains fun every time I play, and I still haven't maxed out Ashley Riots potential.

This game may not be for everyone. It is hard, confusing, and very deep. But for those of you that love fantasy games, a good story, great characters and dialogue, tons of character/equipment customization, and a big challenge, give this game a try. You can get it for cheap now, and even though it's a little dated, it may be one of your best game purchases in quite awhile.

On a final note, I'm thrilled to know that the people who are responsible for this game and for Final Fantasy Tactics are the main creative force working on Final Fantasy XII right now. It should be phenomenal! I can't wait. One of the Greatest Games Ever Made for Fantasy Fans"
5.0	"EA broke the barrier with last year's hit Need For Speed Underground, and rather then let players have some time to catch their breath, BAM!! EA hit us with the new release NFS:U2!!!  I saw the trailers, and read the reviews, and experienced some initial hand wringing due to some of the poor reviews i read on-line, but I can say that Underground 2 is an excellent game, and a worthy addition to EA's stable of racing games.  The graphics are crisp and clean, and the city of Bayview looks beautiful in the neon washed, wet asphalt look that NFS:U made about as famous and imitatable as ""Bullet-Time.""  The car selections are pretty familiar imports that you can soup up to insane levels of performance but not sure where the hydralics come into play??  Seriously the car selection offers the player some nice choices such as the 2000 Honda Civic SI, one of my faves, the Mitsu Evo, the Toyota Supra and Corolla (Legendary drifter), The WRX, and some brand news ones such as the Infinti G35, H2 Hummer, and the 2005 Mustang GT!!!  The city is huge, but easy to move around in with or without the aide of a wonderful GPS system that is very similar to the one used in Smuggler's Run and Midnight Club (think BIG GLOWING ARROW)that helps the directionally impaired find their next race, garage, or shop.
  At first i found driving all over the city pretty distracting, and I wasn't sure if i liked the idea, but after awhile it becomes second nature, and I like tooling around Bayview in my Souped Up Civic.  SUV's have been added to the stable of cars that can be raced but I am almost afraid to try that level of racing yet.  EA was kind enough to add replays (FINALLY!!!) and a very nice Dyno center where the tuner in all of us can tinker, and tweak with your car to get the most out of it, and actually see the numbers on the dyno, nice touch.  Many real world sponsors have gotten involved with this series and you can slap parts on your car in the game that you can get down at the local shops.  I like the realism in that, plus it sounds cool to say that you have a Greddy Turbo, AEM Cold Air Intake, DC Sports Header and Venom Nitrous Oxide System on your Civic SI.  Maybe its just me.
  The races are still set up with Drags, Drifts, Circuits, Sprints, and some new ones have been added the awesome URL, Underground Racing League, and Auto Cross racing which seems more like Nascar with all the banging, and shoving.  A feature borrowed from Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero has also been added where the player can challenge random cars to Outrun matches which adds to re-play value, and adds that Bad Boy factor.
  The only negative i can see is that rather then use real motion, or animated sequences with your street racing tutor like from the first one U:2 uses a graphic novel approach to the cutscenes involving the ""story"".  I'm not real crazy about that, BUT i will not let that one little tiny complaint detract from what i think is an exceptionally fun and satisfying racing game.
  I am still playing the Career mode like a madman and don't think i have the stones to go on-line and see how real people are racing, but the game is excellent by my standards, and I have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it in just a few races.  So give it a try Drop it in and Drive.  Come you know you want to!!! Another Winner in the NFS Series!!!"
5.0	"This is an amazing mouse. I am a great fan of Logitech products and I recently picked this up to free myself from my wired g600.

I do not play a lot of games dependent on accuracy so this product was right for me. Logitech has a great program to customize this and many of its mice. You can adjust the report rate and the DPI sensitivity. Depending on how high you want it, it will drain the battery faster. I set mine to endurance and it has lasted every bit of the 250 hours it suggests. This is an amazing mouse. I am a great fan of Logitech ..."
5.0	Forget the wheel complaints.  This game is hot.  If you want a boring sim, play GT5 (and you can use your wheel). Hot
5.0	I get it, it's features are lame but for me this game is cool. It was fun to wrestle with even though there were times where the wrestler would run and stay running and never move again, or when you would lift up a wrestler to perform a finisher and they would stay dazed for like a few minutes, corny moments but still good. Great Game
5.0	Worked exactly as it was suposed to and saved me money off the cost of renewing directly though xbox live - what's not to like? save some money with this
5.0	love my vita. this product is not for everyone, but if you have a lot of vita games, and have the psp/ ps1 classics, playing them on the tv is great. I know a lot of people wanted some one in all streambox, but I use mine for gaming, and for that it is great. love my vita
5.0	One of the best games I've played. I thought it was going to be Assassin's Creed but this game is its own beast. I'm at 92% completion and I hate to finish this game right now. If you love open world games in the realm of Lord of the Rings, this is the game for you. I hope to see a sequel, but like I said, I haven't finished the game yet, and I don't want to. But I will to see if there's a chance of a sequel. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF THIS DECADE SO FAR
5.0	Works perfectly & no damage, when received. Product is satisfactory & same as advertised. I would definately do business with them, again Awesome!
5.0	Quite an improvement from the big bulky controller for the N64 that had tones of buttons! First off, there are only four normal buttons to this controller, with one start button, no select button! Then there are huge L + R buttons, why are they so huge? Because the L + R buttons constantly break with the N64 and Super Nintendo controllers, so Nintendo redesigned the L + R buttons and made them spring loaded and big to take the pressure of little kids jamming the buttons with their fingers. Next there are two analog sticks, one on the top left and one on the bottom right for shooting games like the 007 games and A Perfect Dark games. For accurate game control there is an old fashioned directional pad at the bottom left. Also, you no longer have to put memory cards into the controller, because of the new Gamecube design (you put the cards into the Gamecube) and finally there is a rumble pack built into the controller, which never needs batteries due to the new technology. All and all, the controller is light and can fit in little hands! New design new durability and playability, no trigger!
5.0	"Hopefully, your a big Jumble fan and have figured out that ""BAILYRR"" is ""LIBRARY"".
But if your not a fan, then read no further although I do insist that all gamers need to include this in their library because everyone needs to keep their grey matter in check.
Excellent effort on the part of Destineer Inc in creating a DS version of this old newspaper classic.
And I do use the word 'old' with great reverence since I used to do the Jumbles in the paper when I was in high school many millennia ago.
And since the 60's I see that they've come up with Jumble Crossword and the namesake of this game: Jumble Madness which is a clever combination of Jumble and Mah-jongg.
Although you can play in ""timed"" mode, I prefer the more ""relaxed"" mode for the regular Jumble and Crossword versions.
Jumble Madness is in a class all it's own because you travel the world looking for lost souvenirs which is a great adventure unto itself.
And in addition to all of the above, this game stays true to its Jumble heritage in that you can still do the 'daily Jumble' since the game is set in a calendar mode.
And for those of you who used to wait for the daily newspaper to come to do the Jumble, you can appreciate that.
Wonderfully executed piece of ""retro-mericana"".
Thanks. Jumble Madness is a great addition to your DS ""BRILAYR""."
5.0	Very good Five Stars
5.0	Perfect at all Five Stars
5.0	"I've played them all: EQ2, WOW, AC2, SWG, FFXI, etc.

City of Heroes is the best MMO I've ever played and one of my top 5 games of all time.  Why?  Because of the attention to detail and the game's design.  The interface for the game is amazing and should be studied by future MMOs for many years to come.  Jumping into the game is easy for the most casual gamer.  The game is fun right away.  Finding or joining a group is remarkably easy.  The customization of the overlay windows is astounding.  The programmers put as much thought into how to play the game as they did into the game itself.  And, they are constantly innovating.  The first and second patches to the game were huge improvements on an already wonderful game.  With this MMO, you get what you pay for in monthly fees.  I know I will be playing this game for years.  Trust me.  Give it a chance! Unbelievable Design & Innovation!"
5.0	This is great way to store your amibo cards. Five Stars
5.0	I love this mouse.  It is very precise.  It has cool lighting and a cool Dragon.  The cord looks like a shoelace, which is awesome.  I love the back/forward buttons built into the thumb area, quicker for web browsing. Best Mouse I Have Ever Used
5.0	"If you have never played an NFS game before, the time to start is now. EA has been in a bit of a racing drought lately. Need for Speed III, Hot Pursuit (the first one) was a great racing game, and High Stake followed up brilliantly. However, with Porsche Unleashed, the franchise sunk into a small pothole. Now, NFS is back with a sequal to the original Hot Pursuit, and it truly takes you back to the real glory days of illegal european racing.

 Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 takes you into the driver's seat of one of several European and American cars to try your luck against other A.I. controlled cars, and the games main attraction--cops. The Graphics in this game prove to all that the PS2 can produce some serious beauty--there is no build in scenery whats so ever. The cars sparkle with amazing effects including shadows of trees on the paintjobs. Other effects include falling weather, kicked up dust, tumbleweeds and more--all come with only a little bit of slowdown...every once in a while that is.

 The Controls are easy to learn and only take about two laps to get completely used to. The Camera never spaces out, spare the momments when you're jumping and the camera pans around your car. New features include a panning camera to check out your surroundings and damage, as well as a flame that fires ahead to show police road blocks, squad cars, or even just what directions the road takes ahead.

 The Sound is simply amazing. The music trax, though a little short, are winners, while effects and engines make you feel as though gasoline is pumping through your veins. The A.I. in the game has obviously taken on a few adjustments. The other cars know when it's time to block you, or to push you off the road. Also, there is no consistancy in the route other cars will take around the track, which makes it feel like you are neck and neck with real human racers.

 So will you have fun with this game. YES! The game offers fun for racers and non-racers alike. Everyone will find a function in the game that they like, and nobody will be dissapointed with the racing excitement that the game offers. Get this game now. Electronic Arts comes back with a hit for the ages"
5.0	This is seriously one of my favor games. If you enjoyed Mass Effect or Dragon Age and you like Star Wars do yourself a favor and get this game. KOTOR!
5.0	Great Five Stars
5.0	Its Yoshi, and he is made out of yarn. You know you want it. Just buy him already!
5.0	Beautiful mouse!! My husband loved it and so do I. You see I don't need super advance mouse such as this to perform my normal computer tasks. But my husband has been on the hunt for a gaming mouse, and ho and behold, he finally found it. We purchased this using a promo code so we can test and review it. First of all, the mouse is beautiful and appealing. It is the right size for your hand, it is very very comfortable to use. No intense pressure needed when clicking, the scroll is amazing and very responsive. The additional buttons on the left side are really useful when browsing the internet as they serve as back and forward button. My husband loved the fact that you can put weights on the mouse, depending on how you want it. He said he really liked it when he plays league of legends, as compared to just using a normal mouse. Gaming experience using this mouse is amazing and comfortable at the same time. You can also adjust practically everything into your own liking. Beautiful mouse!
5.0	i love this game it is really war style . you have to build an army and do some side quests to win big battles and the fighting system is fantastic and strategic and the peak of the game is when you are in a big battle so if you liked spartan total warrior from the same studio you sure gonna like this one dude WONDERFUL...
5.0	This fit like a glove.it work great with vita. The only bad part is that it covers the PS button.for those who hate the blue light then this is your answer. Highly bulit and would Highly recommend. well done Hori.
5.0	"Sins of a Solar Empire (""SoaSE"") is an instant classic.  It breaks new ground in the real time strategy genre by blending the broad scope of a 4X civilization-management game with the fine-grained space battles of a game like Homeworld.  With the flick of your mouse's scroll wheel, you can go from looking at your empire of dozens of planets, all the way down to observing individual ships in your fleets, all rendered in beautiful 3D.

To be sure, SoaSE is a hybrid game - its battles do not have the depth of Homeworld, and it's civilization management doesn't have the level of micromanagement of a game like Civilization 4.  But this is part of what makes SoaSE so brilliant.  It blends both genres in a way that is manageable and extremely entertaining for the player with an interface that is intuitive and relatively unobtrusive.  One of the great things about the game is that you can choose how fast or how slow you want it to play.  For beginning players, in order not to get overwhelmed, the option to turn the game speed down is a life saver.

Graphically, the game is very high quality though not envelope-pushing.  I am perfectly happy with the game's graphics, and amazed at how scaleable the engine is - it runs beautifully on my three year old Dell Inspiron with a GeForce Go 6800 at 1680x1050 with 2x Anti-Ailiasing.  And the game has never crashed on me - not once.

If you're a fan of strategy - heck, even if you're not - you owe it to yourself to buy this game.  It's top quality all the way. Very Impressive"
5.0	I will write a more detailed review, after I get one. I have it, But need joystick first
5.0	"One of the things that I've always loved about Sony systems as well as those from Nintendo is that there was always these games that received barely any attention or press or even much sales yet you're like ""hey, this looks intriguing"" and you check it out and sure enough it's quite a fun play. After buying a PSP, I checked out some opinions of top games and frequent ""games to get for PSP"" lists and though I wasn't a huge fan of Splinter Cell, I thought I'd give it a shot anyway and actually found quite a fun game. Though storyline-wise and character-wise I'm completely lost and don't know anybody, it was still a fun experience.

Story: You play as special operative Gabe Logan who's sent to a ship in the Indian Ocean to retrieve a new dangerous piece of technology in the hands of terrorists. But the more he digs and the more he realizes things don't fit, he finds himself finding old enemies and allies as well as possibly the idea that one enemy was on his side. I don't want to spoil too much since it's hard to bring down but it's also quite intriguing so it's best to just play it.

Graphics: The PSP, despite being small, can crank out some pretty surprising graphics, as evidenced by God of War and Crisis Core. Logan's Shadow is pretty much the same thing since it's so sharp, heavily detailed, characters are well animated, the cutscenes are quite gorgeous (though the eyes...freaky looking) and the different visors like night and heat vision look quite splendid as well.

Sound/Music: The music's quite fantastic actually and while I was getting a bit tired of those wailing vocals in films like 300 and Gladiator to show off that ""epic"" atmosphere, here the music helps and keeps you on your toes with ambience or straight ahead action tunes for the bigger stuff. The voice acting is also quite stellar and with different accents and dialects along with Logan (doing his best Eastwood impression I guess), it's a joy to watch as well as hear.

Gameplay: The PSP of course doesn't have the more numerous buttons that the Dual Shock controllers have though the PSP makes do and it's actually pretty well handled. Controlling Gabe is through the nub and the D-pad is for interaction like holding left for visors, right for weapons, down for crouching and up for interaction like opening doors, climbing or accessing different mission keypads and such. At first it took awhile to get used to, even with training modes to guide you in. But playing through the main story modes, it was easy to figure out and pretty soon swimming and going through the levels were pretty soon, though I weirdly couldn't get used to weapon changing.

Combat is more frequent and instead of Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell having an emphasis on stealth than action, this game will have you frequently running into enemies. There's still stealth kills to be had, sure, but the rarity of them happening and being spotted was quite numerous. Taking cover, Gabe has the ability to peek and fire and also blind firing over his shoulder or head, forcing the enemy to find cover. The AI is well-handled though it's easy to play the waiting game and just keep your crosshairs on the spot the enemy will show up then when he turns, blammo. One complaint was the ones that bomb in and it was hard to turn the camera and hit them though the difficulty never really got brutally difficult and with a handy radar for enemy positions, it wasn't too frustrating to deal with.

I'd very much recommend playing Logan's Shadow as its one of the top games for the handheld...though if this is your first one, you'll probably be like me and wonder ""who's Lian? or Teresa? or him or him?"" Very fun and engrossing stealth action"
5.0	Good game Five Stars
5.0	Kids love it Five Stars
5.0	yes Five Stars
5.0	Fantastic! Five Stars
5.0	"This is an awesome mouse at a really great price. So far I haven't had any troubles with the functionality, but it was a bit weird getting used to the ambidextrous form factor. After using it for a while it is pretty comfortable and fits my hand well in different grips. The DPI switch is easy to access and works well for those of you wanting insanely high speed mouse movement. The cable is also sturdy and braided.

There's nothing extra with this mouse, but it has solid performance and is worth picking up if you need a new mouse and only have a couple bucks at the ready. Great for the Price"
5.0	I enjoyed the campaign very much i love the relationship between BT and Cooper it was definitely believable and fun to play through the only thing i didn't like was the platforming parts but other then that the gameplay was real fun i even played a little Multiplayer which is much better then the first Titanfall especially with all the customization it was worth the $40 i spent and should have sold much more because this is a great game GO BUY IT! My Personal Game Of The Year (2016)
5.0	Plenty of others have reviewed this game.  I just wanted to add another vote with five stars.  The thing that sets TF2 apart from other MP games is the fact that they put so much energy into the details of design.  They spend more time worrying over small details like the asethetics of the various classes than other game developers spend on thier entire game.  Same level of attention is applied to map design, weapon balance, class balance.  It really is the whole enchilada.  And the equally astonishing part is the game is insanely entertaining, never takes itself serious, attracts a loyal player base, and Valve continues to support the game 2 years after its release with new maps, new class updates.  IMHO, TF2 is THE standard for multi-player based games. Sets the Bar For Team Play Multi-Player
5.0	"It's been a couple of weeks since the bomb that is Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has dropped. Did you get caught in its blast? Or have you avoided its fallout? If you have then I say what the hell are you waiting for?? Go get contaminated!

It's not all the time a game like Uncharted 2 comes around. A game that will say hello to you, then grab you by the neck and slam you around the room a few times, stop, then kiss you a bit and get you all emotionally connected only to take your lips 2 minutes later and tuck them between your legs and pull them up over your ass so fast it'll make your head spin right off your neck. Ok, so that won't literally happen, but if you were to take that energy, passion, climactic intensity, and overall jaw dropping action and crush it all up into one neat little ball of beauty, power, and downright coolness, then you my friend might as well call that little ball Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.

You should know the story by now. You're the hero, who goes on a journey of personal fulfillment, only to find yourself in a situation where you have to save to world. It may sound big scale because it is. The way the game starts equals that of most Hollywood blockbusters. And know, that it does not let up.

From start to finish all you will find yourself doing is sitting on the edge of your seat wanting more and more. It has been said that this is not a game, but more like an interactive movie. The nail couldn't have been hit more dead on. The way the story rolls with sequences that take control for seconds at a time and are so fluid you don't even realize you're back in control of the character are amazing to watch. The timing of the action, the dialogue, the scenery, there is absolutely nothing small about this game and it let's you know that with every shoot out, car explosion and helicopter chase. The level of detail from a murky jungle to the ruins of a lost city, would be done no justice by explaining them with nothing but simple words. The character designs, not just the way they look, but their attitudes, their demeanor, the way they act and the things they do, all will leave you loving, hating, laughing and mourning with every step they take, every thing they do and every word they say.

There are moments where you're hurt and can't run at full speed. Moments where you'll be dragging someone around and you feel it in the way you walk, you feel the tense moments of trying to shoot someone with your one free hand. It's almost as if the people of Naughty Dog sat down and asked what would be the most over the top things to experience in a game? And amazingly, without a lack of polish, or quality, they managed to have you saying ""no effing way, did that just happen?!"" over and over again.

Now, being over the top is not necessarily a good thing. But when it's scripted moments that when thought about, you can actually see happening in the given situation, then over the top is definitely a good thing. Thinking realistically, the outcome may not always be the hero coming out unscathed, but then again, like I said, this is a Hollywood blockbuster type game. So don't expect anything less.

Now, as far as negatives go. It really is hard to sit and look for something bad in something so good. But being on the last leg of my second playthrough of this averaged 10-12 hour game, I can honestly say there is almost nothing I can point out and say this is a flaw. I'd love to sit here and say there is but there really isn't. The only solitary thing I noticed on my second playthrough is the issue of trying to take cover on a wall when it is right next to another wall. The proximity of the two walls make it a little difficult to attach yourself to the one you want to if you're not looking at it at the right angle and it can leave you open for a serious hurting at the wrong time. But like I said, that was noticed on my second playthrough so it's not even really a problem or issue, more of a gripe. Other than that there are people who will nit pick and say something wasn't rendered right or say that's B.S., that can't ever really happen, but when it comes down to it, as far as gameplay, mechanics, background environments, and story go, this package is virtually flawless. The flaws of the first game have been fixed and improved upon, the animation is on point and like I said, the characters make you feel like you know them. I can promise you, if you enjoy playing video games, and enjoy a story driven experience then there is nothing that will stop you from loving this game.

Now, as far as multiplayer goes, I've given my impressions on it before. You can find it here: [...]. And it all still stands. The multiplayer mode of this single player monster was always worried about. But in the end it turned out to be a solid piece of work that surprised a lot of people. It's fun, it's addicting, easy to get used to and full of things to unlock and use. It captures the essence of the single player experience amazingly well and you can't help but feel like you walked out of the store buying 2 games for the price of 1. The only problem with the multiplayer is that more than likely, by the time you read this, a monstrous behemoth of the multiplayer world known as Modern Warfare 2 would have came out. And no matter how amazingly great the multiplayer of Uncharted 2 is, there are few that will be able to contend with the likes of what Infinity Ward is going to bring to the online table. And it's because of that fact this aspect of the game will be considered a lost gem for online players in the near future.

Ok. You've seen the videos, you've read the reviews, and heard the praise. I'm telling you nothing different. Since day one I've had the pleasure of enjoying Uncharted 2 and couldn't be happier. I know this is more of a commercial than a review but it is so hard not to love this game, and even harder to find something wrong with it. Everything I've said is as close to the truth as I know it. There are honestly no games out there that I can say I've completed and not 5 minutes later, started all over again just for fun. The replay value is grand with 100 collectible treasures cleverly scattered throughout the game. Trophies with matching in-game medals that will net you money to spend on their little storefront where you can buy behind the scenes movies, and various items that you can use and apply to a very robust multiplayer if Modern Warfare 2 isn't your thing.

All in all Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is thee must buy for any Playstation 3 owner. Sure, you can rent it, just be warned that by the time you finish it, or maybe even start it, you're going to be wishing you didn't have to send it back and that it was all yours to play whenever you want. This is what gaming is all about. This is why I have a passion for my hobby. And it is the reason why I love my PS3 again.

On my rating scale, I give this experience a stunning:
5 Water Bottles Full of Pee, out of 5.... (that scale should be self explanatory) Fall in Love with your PS3 All Over Again"
5.0	excellent Five Stars
5.0	Works perfect A true godsend
5.0	This game is both fun and challenging and I remember being up at 1:30 in the morning just playing this game its a lot of fun. I would reccomend this game to all ages. Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass
5.0	"Dream Master is a basic platformer game with it's own little twist. There are 8 levels of play. 7 levels require you to get keys to unlock the door at the end of the level. You must explore the whole levels to find all the keys. To get some keys, you have to feed various animals candy to put them into a dream state. Afterwards, you can ride them. You can ride the frog, the gorilla, the lizard, the bee, the mouse, and more to get all the keys. The game gets pretty challenging as you progress. I have a lot of problems in the 3rd level because of the way it moves. All the stages of the game very well represent all 8 dreams and nightmares Little Nemo has straight from the movie. You have the mushroom forest, the underwater world, Nemo's house, the train level, and more. In the 8th level, you get the dream staff where you can shoot laser balls up at a 45 degree angle built for the boss battles in level 8 where you see the Nightmare.

The overall game and design is great and very well done. Many Capcom games do very well with Disney games and were all mostly the quality of Mega Man games. So, it is fair to expect a great game. My only complaint in this game is that it is a little too hard for the audience it is directed to. I usually use Game Genie on 2 or 3 levels and go back to normal gameplay.

The controls are very good and responsive and the same for all the animals you get to ride.

The music is all really good and about as catchy as the music from Mega Man or Duck Tales.

The bottom line is that this game is very good, just prepare for a very difficult game after the 2nd level. Fun game, but gets very hard very quick..."
5.0	The Xbox One controller takes everything that was great about the Xbox 360 controller and improved it.  And removed the bad D Pad.  Xbox One's controller fits in the hand nicely, and is extremely responsive.  And receives updates. The King of Controllers
5.0	I have played this game at a friends house and loved it. I just bought this game because I just bought a Play Station 2 and I would recommend this to anyone who loves racing games. There are 5 plces you can racing including Arizona,Brazil,and New York. I would Totally recommendthis game to anyone who loves racing or has other family members.(also to Hummer lovers)I am not sure why people are complaing this is not an off road game because most of this game is off road! Great Game for the Price!!
5.0	"A great evolution of the Disgaea franchise, adding many new mechanics (such as giant monster fusion, and giant magichange and online pirate ships) and an adorable array of varied characters for you to fall in love with.
The premium edition came with a cute Fuka figure, soundtrack and artbook.

It was a great buy, and the game will teach you more about sardines than any other game on the market! Sardines!"
5.0	Great System. Love it!
5.0	"I bought this Friday,and I have not stopped playing it since!!Being a great fan of the show does heighten the level of fun.

I encountered Simon and Randy's criticism,

but I think that's the fun of it!

It teach you to ""raise the bar"",and be better at the song next time around. Great Fun! Great Songs!"
5.0	The Wizard's Pen keeps you guessing no way someone would say they're bored, NOT! And the Mystery P.I. you must have good sight to find the hidden items. This is a 5-star game for me, others may feel different. My whole family downloaded my purchased games onto their pcs too. Such a fun PC game
5.0	"Pros:

+A good challenge overall
+Loveable characters
+Fantastic voice acting and cinematics
+Good sense of humor
+Creative puzzles that aren't too difficult to learn

Cons:

-It can feel like the game is holding your hand at times
-A short adventure overall

About a year after the Playstation 3 launched, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune landed down and became one of the first games to really take advantage of what the PS3 could do.  But beyond that, however, Naughty Dog has done a fantastic job creating a simple adventure game that's easy to pick up and learn and yet at the same time can provide a challenge.

You play as Nate, a treasure hunter who has just uncovered to coffin of his ancestor Drake.  In the coffin, Nate finds a treasure map leading to the Lost City of Gold: Eldorado.  He's got a journalist tagging along who wants to find a good story as well as a partner named Sully.  Of course, Drake isn't the only one after the treasure.  Throughout his journey he'll not only face the perils of the ruins he discovers but also have to battle pirates.  There's nothing original about the storyline, but the characters are incredibly likeable--particularly Nate himself.  The story and dialog within the story is also incredibly well written.  As you get yourself into certain skirmishes Nate will also give his own commentary which is sometimes humorous.  That's not the only thing that's humorous.  Much of the dialog in the cutscenes is also funny.  It's a game that knows it's clever but is careful not to rub your face in its wit.  It makes a simple story all the more enjoyable.

Gameplay is pretty simple to pick up on and play.  For the most part you'll be doing one of two things: Solving puzzles or participating in gun fights.  When it comes to the games puzzles, most of them are pretty clever, but none of them are too hard.  Some puzzles, such as the jumping puzzles, can seem a little threatening, but for the most part Nate does all the jumping automatically.  All you have to be doing is facing the right direction and he usually lands a jump.  This doesn't mean you can't jump too early, but for the most part, Nate is good at grabbing on ledges.  For the most part, gameplay flows incredibly smoothly.

The other aspect of gameplay is the gun fights.  Just about every gun fight plays out the same way.  You hide behind an object, you pop out and you shoot at your enemy.  You can carry two weapons with you at a time and each time you down an enemy you can have their remaining ammunition.  While it seems like ammo would be plentiful, it's not really.  Even if you manage to make every shot count your adversaries can take quite a bit of damage.  Luckily there's also melee combat involved.  None of it is hard to pick up and learn, though it's quite surprising how difficult Uncharted can be.  In fire fights where you're surrounded on all sides it can be difficult to find cover to let your health recover.  Not to mention you can run low on ammo.  And despite the melee combat, it can be hard to pull off on a single enemy when you're being shot by three others.  Despite that, when you get the hang of it and you know where to go to get cover, Uncharted can be fun.  It can feel a little repetitive at times, but with the good mix of cutscenes that don't drag on and puzzle elements, there's a good amount of variety.

Likewise, you'll never find yourself in too dire need of trouble.  The game is pretty linear for the most part.  Despite all you can see in the environments, it's pretty straightforward.  Should you find yourself lost the game will point you in the right direction.  Just the same, the helpful prompts that remind you how to duck behind cover and how to shoot never stop popping up when it seems like your stuck.  It would feel like the game was holding your hand if you couldn't turn these off, but you can and you're allowed to do things yourself.  If you ever find the game being too hard or too easy, you can adjust the difficulty level on the fly.

The strongest aspect of Uncharted is without a doubt the game's stellar production values.  It's quite possibly the best looking PS3 out there.  The detail put into the world you're in is incredible.  There's eagle eye attention to detail.  When Nate goes into water and emerges, for example, the water is actually dripping off his clothes and they look damp and he'll slowly dry off.  Not to mention that the lighting effects are fantastic as well.  There can be slight dips in frame rate, but you may not actually notice them.  The music is also fantastic as it fits the adventure well.  Better than the music, however, is the voice cast.  Every voice suits each character well but they also put a lot of good emotion into it and inject the right tone when it's called for.  The production values are one of the reasons to at least check the game out.

While there will without a doubt be some who find the gunplay repetitive, at least the other elements keep the game afloat.  If there was anything wrong with Drake's Fortune, it would be that the game is pretty short.  Aside from that, it's a game that's worth checking out if you're into the Adventure genre. An Amazing Game Overall"
5.0	F Zero X for N64 was a great game so after seeing the reviews and videos of F Zero GX I couldn't wait to get it. Being one of the primary reasons I purchased a Gamecube, I hoped it would live up to my expectations. It did, and in many ways surpassed them. The graphics are outstanding. The sense of speed is simply mind-boggling, you probably wouldn't find a faster game. The majority of track designs are absolutely great. The story mode is deep, plus there is a Grand Prix mode, and it's also four player. You also race against up to 29 opponents, and of course the gameplay is absolutely great. One problem however, is its difficulty. For Pros, this may be seen as a nice challenge. But for novices, the game can be frustratingly hard. This may turn away some. If you think you are up for the challenge, this game is a MUST BUY. Good futuristic racers are rare...this should rekindle you interest in the dying genre. An EXCEPTIONAL game...but also exceptionally difficult
5.0	I am a big pokemon fan, love this game. love this game
5.0	Amiibo's are as Amiibo's does! Sonic is characterized PERFECTLY here!  I Love it. Nice
5.0	Fun game, Grandchildren love it! Great Buy
5.0	"Yeah, it's a bit dated, but it's one of the greatest games of all time. It's one of the earliest open world games. You can go just about anywhere at any time. There were earlier games like Adventure, but this is the first masterpiece in my opinion. There is a wide variety of bosses and eight dungeons.

It was originally on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. This game is unchanged except for the additional ability to save anywhere and restore save states.

This code is only for the 3DS, 2DS, 3DS XL, New 3DS XL, and the New 3DS. It will not work on the Wii, WiiU or any other system or computer.

The game is certianly dated by today's standard. But with a little imagination, and a lot of patience, there is still an amazing world to explore. It's a much harder game than games today, but it is definitely playable with practice.

If you want something less dated, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past can be purchased on the WiiU. The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is a modern 3DS game in the overhead style of these games. Great game!"
5.0	YES Five Stars
5.0	"With a limited number of Wii ""pistols"" out there and wanting to avoid the two handed guns, I got two of these.  They work great!  They hook in nicely and the orange latch keeps the remote from moving around inside the gun. Great gun!"
5.0	this game is great. there's not much i can say about this particular Sonic title though. i can say though that it's graphics are little off for a Sonic title on the cube not like that matters though.  there's a dark story and the hero story.  if you want good graphics then get Sonic heros for the gamecube too. Sonic adventure two gamecube version. great title
5.0	"I just got this game and after playing for a couple of hours I can say that Need for Speed Series is back on track. I was around for the original Need for Speed and Hot Persuit series, those were so much fun, if they could oly bring those back.

ProStreet and Carbon were complete disasters, extreamly disapointing, I had to stop playing after my first time.... this one is at least 4 times better than the lader.

The graphics are crisp, but many daytime sceens look washed on my HDTV, I thought something was wrog with my TV. lol. But that's how the game is. But that aside, gameplay is designed for super highspeed, the stearing ratio is tight, meaning that if you just tap the controler, you'll hit a wall, but at high speeds, you need that tight streaing ratio. The cops aren;t that dumb like some say, they don't stop chasing you.... I got caught.

Some say the frame rate gets choppy, I have't seen that yet.

Overall gamplay and the fun factor are high.. the game is fast paced, not like the last 2 games that were out. I would say if you a NFS fan, this is the one to get.

EDIT: This game is better than I describe, I haven't been able to stop playing.. The cops caught me many times, and it's true that with the first car it's easy to beat the challenges, but the challenges get harder, where you need to upgrade your car and buy power add on's as well to win.... Frame rate is fine, absolutly no freezing..Great Game, I think the folks bashing this game, don't actually own it! Very well"
5.0	The loading times don't take long to me.every one lied the loading times only take 20 seconds.every one wrote blah blah blah the loading times take forever.well they don't trust me they dont.anyway what happens in this game uka uka is mad at cortex the rest of the evil gang.but cortex comes up with an evil plan and its up to crash to save the day.the chacatars in this game are crash,coco,aku aku,pura,cortex,uka uka,n.gin,n.tropy,crunch,tiny tiger,dingodile,the elamentals masks called rok-ko,wa-wa,py-ro,and lo-lo.the only bosses in this game are crunch the elamentals masks.there are five warp rooms.the levels are really cool there are levels about riding a jeep,being chased by a dragon,controling a robot,controling a submraine,coco being chased by water,rolling in ball,and lots of other cool levels. BUY THIS GAME IT IS FUN! BEST GAME OF YHE YEAR!
5.0	"Excellent. The story isn't convoluted like it could get with games that deal with time lines plot. Keep in mind this is not time traveling back and forth between past present or future, but time traveling between parallel dimensions although sometimes you can arrive in the future or past of that parallel dimension but you won't get back to those again. This prevents the plot from being a total mess of changes in a single timeline like certain ffxiii-2. The music and graphics are pretty beautiful. The battle system is a lot of fun that includes some tactics and thinking. The fields are about the right size and not too vast nor boring with tons of monsters to fight. Hated the loan to pad the length of the game but it is good if you need to level up or have some fun with battles then it will become a good excuse in the game that will push you to do so.
Lots of non graphic related content with characters side stories that I enjoyed a lot and did them all. You will get back all the six party members from the previous games plus Gaius, Muzet, Elle (she is not playable though) and Ludger the main protagonist of this sequel. All of them come back with different outfits as well as the previous outfits and color variation of both and with their personalities slightly changed after one year but they are still awesome!
The world is pretty much the same with the exception of three or four new locations in elympios.
This game is perfect for those who like hack n slash and RPGs as well as those who enjoy anime and stories with depth and lots of dialogue which I do (of course it's a TALE so it must have lots of dialogue). Fans of the franchise should also play it. Tales of xillia both have been one of the darkest to date, which is also something very interesting to experience with. No doubt you will have humour and love in the game though! It's a pretty good and entertaining tale!"
5.0	Another supervillin fun, wario strikes again! It got here really fast too! The for the fun! Five Stars
5.0	My little guy loves Pokemon and he enjoys playing this game. The game arrived in great condition, unopened, and new. Made my son's day
5.0	"I've been in the mech game for a bit now, since my first CM Storm Quickfire TK (Cherry Blue) in 2013. I absolutely loved that board, but I wanted to explore other switches. In 2014 I grabbed a Corsair Vengeance K70 (Cherry Brown) and l enjoyed the smoother, more muted key actuation a lot better. I've also had a Monoprice Select (Gateron Red) which felt better than Cherry Red but had a weird layout I couldn't get used, and I just didn't enjoy reds as much as browns either.

Once I got the Logitech G410 I instantly fell in love. The switches are incredible. I would describe them as a quicker, quieter Cherry Brown switch. They feel fantastic for both typing and gaming.

This is also my first RGB keyboard, and the lights are mind-blowing. It has 16.8 million per-key RGB lighting, which means there is unlimited possibility for color customizations. You really need to experience RGB lighting to fully appreciate it. Haters will call it a gimmick. Sure, it's unnecessary and doesn't add any real value, but it looks undeniably awesome, especially at a dark LAN party. As for the gamer-style shape of the board; I didn't like it in pictures, and I think I would still prefer a normal wrist wrest (or none at all). However, it is hardly noticeable whatsoever when typing. It also gives it a unique look. Sure, it doesn't look ""professional"", but I'm fine with that.

The board construction feels solid despite its light weight. There are four rubber feet plus 2 rubber feet on the risers, so it's not going anywhere.

As for ARX (the phone dock), that seems like a kind of silly feature. I can't really complain though, I just won't use it.

I got this baby for 60 pesos refurbished on 3bay. At that price it is an absolute steal. Even for 80 it's completely worth it. Keep kicking butt Logitech. Your peripherals are top tier right now.

UPDATE 4-15-18 - Still using this board. Still loving it. Still feel that Romer-G's are an ideal switch for gaming (Dota 2 in particular). Easiest 5 stars I've ever given a product."
5.0	My grandson just loved it even in that weird stuff like that It was a big hit with my grandson
5.0	There is no reason Sony is holding these back for release in america.  It only hinders the sale of the Vita system.  Had to import this from Japan.  Worth every penny! Massive storage 64gb = 59 actual
5.0	Seriously.  It's incredible. Best.  Game. Ever.
5.0	Excellent Five Stars

5.0	Perfect. Exactly as described Five Stars
5.0	Very nice little game! Toddler friendly! A great starter game for little ones that are just learning to use a Nintendo DS system. :) Very nice little game! Toddler friendly! A great starter game for little ones that are just learning to use a Nintendo DS system
5.0	Not a big fan on the placement of the buttons on both sides of the mouse, because I keep accidentally keep clicking them, but I love the mouse itself and looks great with the black widow keyboard. For the price this is an excellent mouse and I would recommend. Love it!
5.0	I am very please with this product Five Stars
5.0	"Before I start this... I really don't think buying it on Amazon is really worth it... Go buy it at either Target or Best Buy. Go to Best Buy if you're a hardcore Katy Perry fan and Target if you're not. I personally prefer Target's bonus songs (Airplane & Only Girl in the world)  simply because the choreography is MUCH MUCH better. The Best Buy Bonus songs (Teenage Dream & ET) has really lame and repetitive choreography. However, those are MY opinions, not yours, so go check it out on youtube. (Sorry I can't post the links here D:)

Here's the thing... If you've played any Just Dance games before, THEN GET THIS NOW. Don't even Bother reading all these reviews. You'll love it. The new addition of unlockable (by collecting stars) and achievements really REALLY adds to the game. It make you wanna keep dancing.

The graphic update? uh-maze-ing!!! The characters now have facial expressions and they CHANGE!!! I know it doesn't feel like much but it feels much more like the ""coach"" is actually singing the song instead of just dancing there for you to follow. The background actually change as you get better!!! I didn't really notice it until I read the product features on the Amazon page though. Also. Their clothe are much more realistic and you can almost see the texture of their clothe.

The choreography of this game... it's AWESOME. I know... I know... they ruined some of the songs with lame choreography... BUT ""physically"" they're pretty fun and enjoyable. All of these dances are really fun (yes I played them all). These dances really ""relates"" to the song, it feels like you're ""exploring the deep meaning of the song as you dance to these dances.

The music choice? Same as always... a wide range of selections and varying styles. I find them all VERY VERY catchy. I often finding myself humming them in the shower. OH. And the music shop is back!!! with a cheaper price of 250 Wii Points ($2.50).

The best new addition to this game is the ""star collecting"" part. See. When you've completed a song, you are awarded with stars (up to 5) depending on how well you danced. And as you collect the stars, you'll eventually get enough and unlock new additions to the games including new songs and mashups. This feature makes it much more fun to dance by yourself and make your friends want to dance with you more. Another great addition is the ability to have four different players dancing different choreography at the same time (it's so fun). AND, did I mention the ability to choose your character? THAT'S RIGHT!!! You can dance as player 4 even you're holding the player 1 remote, so now you can dance with your friends without the trouble of switching remotes often because the coach is a different gender. OH. Did I mention there's one song that's for 1~8 players... it's like a line dance where you hold hands and do the same thing. TONS OF FUN.

And also... A slight warning to parents... This game has some ""sexual movements"" such humping and kissing... but I guess your kid(s) won't realize what it means until they're old enough to understand it. So I would consider the humping okay. Also, the kissing part would probably just make them go ""EWWWWWW!!!"" and won't actually do it... so it's not a big deal.

Overall... People of all ages, all gender, all interests, all size... YOU'LL LOVE JUST DANCE 3. Cause really, just dance... it will lighten your mood it will make that horrible day go away. Just Dance... T H R E E ! ! ! :D"
5.0	I don't have this item. Five Stars
5.0	more responsive then any wired controller without the hassels best controller
5.0	Came exactly as shown I included a picture. It looks smaller in the picture then what I thought but honestly it is nice very if you like amiibos. The best part of this one is the dog will fight for you in breath of the wild and attack things. Update-It will also hunt animals for you while you explore. I love it! I wanted to update this post to tell people this dog is the only amiibo in the game that is reusable while playing. So if your worried about it not being worth it because the amiibos only are usable once per day do not be. This wolf is probably the best amiibo to buy for your money honestly. I used it more then any of the other ones. This one and the link amiibo for the horse are great options for BOTW. I do not think I have used it for any of the other games though. Like it doesn't work with Mario Cart. So only buy this one for this game. It looks smaller in the picture then what I thought but honestly it is very if you like amibos. The best part of this one is ...
5.0	I love all the metal gear saga.  This is a must for a MG fan I like it!!!
5.0	Great Five Stars
5.0	i still play this one from time to time, and still having the same old fun, i have shared it with a few friends, and every SW junkie i know is still enjoying it. Great game
5.0	I am a huge gamer and to get a new series with fresh ideas is great. And that is what you get here. You really can play the game anyway YOU want to rather than playing a game the way they make you play it. It rewards you yet holds you accountable on whatever way you play it. The replay value is huge as the story plays out different depending on your style of play through. If your a gamer you defiantly want to check this game out. Incredible new series
5.0	"As said in the title Dead Space it's the best horror game EVER made!
Buy it and you won't be disappointed!
Dead Space Rules Best game ever"
5.0	For the <$5 i paid for this it is totally worth it. The screen protectors alone are worth that and it is nice to have spare stylus pens around. Totally worth the money
5.0	"This D-pad and analog stick cover set by Bluecell certainly covers the options when it comes to alternate cover shapes; 8 in all.

The D-pad covers are made out of a hard plastic and fixed to the PSV D-pad with 4 squares of double stick rubber/silicone adhesive pads. One basic cross type design and the other a concave, smoothly contoured diamond. Both add height to the PSV D-pad. I didn't use either design as I like the factory D-pad exactly the way it is. For those who don't, here are two more options.

The 6 analog stick caps are made out of black silicone and stretch over the analog stick heads. Due to the small size of the analog sticks, they're not the most intuitive to install, but if you roll the lip back and then over the edge of the analog stick head, it takes maybe 10-20 seconds, less if you've done it before.

There is one convex cap with concentric grooves for grip, one convex cap with grip dots, one smooth concave cap, one cross tip cap with prominent edges, one diamond shaped cap with an indented arrow for grip and orientation and one slightly concave cap with tiny indented arrows.

I'm using the concave cap for the right stick and the cross tip for the left. Subjectively speaking, it's a marked improvement over the factory analog stick heads.

It should be tough not to find one design that is not a personal preference over the stock convex analog stick head. The only problem is that the set only contains one of each design type meaning, if you don't want to mix and match two different types of cap designs, you should buy two sets. I would have preferred matching sets for the analog stick caps, but it is exactly what is shown in the product description photos. No complaints or misrepresentation there.

The caps add a slight amount of height to the analog sticks for better leverage, and the silicone material provides excellent grip. Good modification for PSV analog sticks"
5.0	This expansion was fun for a little while. I always buy the collectors edition for the free in game items as well as they mousepad and book that comes in the box. Looking forward to the next expansion. This expansion was fun for a little while
5.0	"If you managed to get this Black Friday bundle at either the Lightning Deal price or while it was temporarily available at a lower price, consider yourself lucky. There is no better console deal available for Black Friday than this. For only $199, you get four games and a brand new super slim PS3 console that is only currently available through bundle deals. Currently, the standalone console of the older model PS3 goes for around $250. At the time of this review, the value of the games this console comes with range between $40-60.

You may have noticed that Walmart is selling the same bundle, with a headset and a game for only $20 more. This does seem like a greater deal than the one on Amazon, however, you must consider that with Walmart you have to pay for tax boosting the price up at least 10 more bucks, not to mention shipping (Unless you use site-to-store). Even if you were to sell the games it comes with at a much reduced price and only got $25 out of it, you would still have purchased this console for only $175. Personally, I look at this PS3 as a very unique situation. You can play the system as long as you want and enjoy it, and if you are ever ready to sell it, you can easily make a profit, or at least get 100% of your money back once you are ready to let it go.

There is rumor of a Playstation 4 coming out either next year or the year after, while this is all speculation, you can assume that there will be another price drop on the PS3 once then PS4 is announced. If you did not manage to pick up a PS3 now, you'll have many more chances through Cyber Monday (I am sure this deal will pop up again), or through a future price drop.

You may be in between consoles at the moment, wondering whether to get an Xbox 360, PS3, or Wii U. First off, without seeming too biased, I would like you to lose any and all considerations you have for buying a Wii U. Although it is the first console of the new generation, it has very little improvements over an Xbox 360 and PS3. There are no good games out for it right now. Nintendo is too risky, they seem to throw out all their good games a year or two after launch. Unless you're a diehard fan of one of the games (in my case, Zelda), then I wouldn't tell you to buy it. In fact, you should wait until there is more variety and more games on the system.

Now, as far as Xbox 360 and PS3 go, i've always broken it down into two questions. Are you buying your console for the better online experience? Or are you buying your console more for entertainment, but still want all the benefits of a great gaming console? It's hard to honestly say that the PS3 has better online than the Xbox 360, it just wouldn't be true. There is a price however, $60 a year to be precise. The PS3 is all free, and the price you pay here is a limit on your experience with the community. You cannot join a voice chat group, you cannot do a private voice chat unless you are not in a game. People are forced to do voice chat within the game itself. Also, there is a larger tendency to hear background noises and breathing through PS3. The microphones are too sensitive, and often times, they voices come through chopping and robotic.

I can't say for sure which console is better for you, the individual, but I can tell you one thing. This deal is simply better than any Xbox 360 deal that has come up. The money you put into this console is money that you can easily get back after the madness of Black Friday and Cyber Monday has died out. Everything will slowly go back to the original prices, and people will be willing to pay more for this system. I am sure you could even buy the console at its great low price, and turn it around for profit if you don't open it.

The possibilities are endless with a PS3.

PS3: ""It only does everything"" There is simply no better deal than this"
5.0	I have tried Wii Fitness with the balanced board in the past and it was fun.  But since the Kinect came out, it's so much easier than holding the controller, etc.  The Kinect just sees what your doing without any other objects in your hands.  It's really a great technology.  Anyways, I would rate this one just as good as the Wii Fitness one.  It's a toss up between the two, but this one definitely pushes you more.  So if your looking to lose weight, play this game every morning or every night for a year and you will lose weight efficiently, no doubt.  The more it hurts, the better it is for you is my slogan.  Anyways, try this game out.  Get a Yoga mat, they really help.  I think you also need weights if you want to do some sections, which is annoying but luckily I have a few weights that are low in lbs.  Get this game you won't regret it.  It will make you feel tons better. Excellent game that I want to play more and more
5.0	Best DBZ game ever! Five Stars
5.0	"I really like the WWII fighting games on the xbox360. I rate this as the best Call of Duty game and the second best overall in the game category.  Second only to Medal of Honor - Airborne.

As long as you do not mind getting killed from grenades (an issue in all Call of Duty games), you will enjoy the experience.  Highly recommended. Best Call of Duty game so far..."
5.0	Pretty fun game, feels a bit like Persona, but with a few different elements added in to it. Fun game for the PS Vita
5.0	These extension cords are great!  On single player games, I use both extensions on a single controller and sit 14 feet from my TV.  It doesn't seem to create any lag.  Excellent alternative to the more expensive wireless controllers. Excellent alternative to wireless controllers!
5.0	Great system and especially with XBox live connectivity. Very slick design and as a game I'm overall very satisfied with this new system. X-Rocks. (lol)
5.0	These things are great. I bought two of them and use them both frequently. They're durable cords and solid connectors, and 6 extra feet on a DS2 goes a loooong way. These things are great. I bought two of them and use them ...
5.0	My son asked for this because he loved the movie Sorcerer's Apprentice. He found out the movie was based on this Disney cartoon. He loves having this character for the game. Mickey
5.0	very nice wheel Five Stars
5.0	I got the game fast and in mint condition with a plastic wrapper on,the game itself is awesome,I'm a big fan of Silent hill games,this one is more on the cinematic and problem solving side than most but that makes it way more scarier because you have to use your wits more to survive. Scary
5.0	Endless fun! Five Stars

5.0	"This game is unbelievable. It is, after over two years still one of the most popular games for xbox and when you play xbox live, you can always be sure to find players online. That is an example of how good this game is. Two years!!!!!

This game has a wide variety of weapons, which consist of mostly guns, but also grenades, and a knife. The single-player, while not great, is good enough, and the xbox live is very, very good. Be a terrorist or counter-terrorist and participate in missions (whether its rescuing hostages for the counter-terrorists, or bombing a specific site as a terrorist) in more than 20 maps in both single and multiplayer modes.

Definitely buy this game if you have xbox live.

If you don't i would still consider it. A Classic, must-have for xbox!!!!"
5.0	I love pacman and even though this is not the original it is still a lot of fun! If you like pacman and do not mind a little more challenges along with a story line then this is for you! For those of you who remember PS2's Pacman worlds it is very similar to that! Cute and fun!
5.0	I have always been a FF fan ever since 2 was out. I've been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this. Let me tell you about the game:As you have probably found out from other reviews, it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc., who is polluting the Earth. One of these members is a man named Cloud, a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier, which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles, they proved to be a challenge. Cloud, Sid, and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time. Espeically the 11 minute ending. Man that was good. ENJOY! Quite Possibly the best game i've ever played.
5.0	it awesome game and to bad undertaker is part to the  story line lol and keep up the good job. thank you
5.0	"Since i've heard of this game it looked attractive. But wasn't able to buy it, a lot of time after that I just saw it at $13 more or less, it was cheaper in other stores but I just simply prefer amazon's service. It came about one week after, by the way I live in Guatemala, and I was really really surprised. Not like an epic Metal gear of Uncharted of course, but actually a refressing one, and style of game. Also a lot of quality on it own.

Graphics: Really impressed, textures really show themselves. The shadow of the character is really well done, a lot better than those pixelated ones from Call of duty games. A great special effects, feels great when someone throws a grenade at you.

Sound: Voice acting is not the best, but does the job. Special effects, rock solid, specially on explosions. Music... according to the moment but nothing memorable.

Control: Great, maybe few more actions are welcome but the way it is keep it simple and easy to jump in.

Story:  So far solid, its not as sissy as I thought. It actually keeps you  waiting for the next portion to solve whats happening. Its simple.

Style. Somehow it reminds me to Gears of War, but somehow to uncharted too whis is better, its not a shooter and thats great because there's too much shooters these days.

Overall: This is not a 10 out of 10 game, maybe an 8 - 8.5 game. But its a satisfying one, its a game that really shines if you are not comparing it to those new classics. Its a game, that really entertains, it has issues, but nothing to bother at all. its an amazing price, its and amazing value, its different even when it takes things from other games it implements them great. The glave(weapon) is really fun stuff. Sad but I don't think its going to be a sequel, because it didn't sell well.

Just give it a try, and try to not follow those who buy only hyped games, there tons of gems still to be discovered. After a long time... but still surprised"
5.0	"I have got to say this keyboard has been good to me over the years even after all the abuse and game rages it's been through

though some of the coating on the keys has rubbed off (from heavy usage) this is kind of expected

the lights are a little dim when you have it set it all keys but there are some hacks out there and tutorials on how to make them brighter (Although doing so will most likely VOID YOUR WARRANTY so don't do it unless you want to take the risk)

all in all I'm very satisfied with my purchase Tough little keyboard"

Wii Party U strives to be much more than just copycat game, though, and it succeeds at that.
There is a surprising amount of game modes and ways to have fun. There are multiple modes based on the traditional board-game-video-game rules, but with a twist depending on the mode.

For a notable example: Highway Rollers has you move a ginormous amount of spaces to reach the other side of the board. The numerous minigames that you'll be thrown into determine how many dice you will get to use per turn. There are spaces on the board that can also send you 20 spaces forward, backward, or give you more dice!
There's also a mode based around ""fashion styles"" - You collect pieces of the outfit, show up on the stage when it's nearby, and gather points for the outfit you come onstage with! Lurking around the board causes you to find shops with clothing you could either nab for the outfit, or there are spaces where you can play a minigame to gain a freebie or steal a player's piece!

TV Party (the set of modes the above two are grouped with) contains all sorts of kooky competitive shenanigans and very diverse and equally entertaining minigames that Mario Party has been struggling to execute properly this day and age. And that's just a fraction of what the overall package has to offer!

House Party is a second set of modes that have their own arguably more unique experiences, especially since they don't use the minigames that TV Party partly thrives on. These modes are composed of their own less-than-20-minute exercises that make interesting uses of the Gamepad. You could make a silly face with the camera and make your opponents guess what charade you're doing, draw with the stylus and see whose drawing is the odd one out, or cooperatively press buttons on the Wii Remotes and Gamepad in what's like a new way to play&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twister/dp/B00000DMBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twister</a>. If you won't be playing Wii Party U for a long burst of time, the House Party set is where your short-lived party is at!

And then there's the Gamepad Tabletop games.
These games may only allow two people to play, but the games that are in here nevertheless manage to pack in lots of intense and competitive moments. Heck, I'm just going to say it right now - Tabletop Baseball alone is more intense and addicting than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mario-Super-Sluggers/dp/B001APM444/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mario Super Sluggers</a>. It may seem like a very bold claim, but that's just how I feel about it. Another favorite is Tabletop Foosball, which has never ceased to excite me, whether or not it's simulated on the Gamepad or on a physical table. There are also activities such as the Tabletop Gauntlet and minigames, but Baseball and Foosball are the real deals in this set.

As for the entire Wii Party U game, I wholeheartedly recommend getting it, regardless of whether or not you'll be buying it for a Wii Remote or because you bought Mario Kart. If you are a lone person who doesn't really have people to play with, then subtract one star from the overall rating. Otherwise, this is a great game to play with family and/or friends! A couch multiplayer essential"
5.0	its the good version of Twilight Princess and in HD. It comes with a cool Amiibo. What else do you want? its the good version of Twilight Princess and in HD
5.0	Awesome, A must have for Borderlands fans! Five Stars
5.0	Yeah you will be mad by the way you die on this game by the big time heavy hitter knights that lurk around. once you get up some level you will man handle them so don't worry. Dark Souls is the game that's very annoying, this game is balanced to where you feel like god of war once you level up because you could beat a boss with about 7 punches at the right level/weapon.....Get this game if you looking to go from a average joe to king joe of the world!! 5 out of 5 with fun deaths
5.0	Excelente! Five Stars
5.0	Great price fast shipping Good
5.0	Solid gameplay for both titles. Much fun to be had, and a great start for Mega Man virgins and plenty of replay value for veterans of the series. Fun Mega Man goodness!
5.0	"First of all, let me say that it's terribly difficult for any game to measure up to the standard of awesomeness presented by the first Bioshock, let alone a sequel. Though I haven't yet played through the entire game, I've seen enough. It rocks. Through and through. Though one could argue it's basically more of the same, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Sure, it's familiar, but there are a lot of tweaks and improvements that make things more satisfying as a whole. I'm not going to go into detail. I'd suggest a game review site for that, like IGN or something. The only real gripe I have is that the graphics seem a little less crisp this time around. Not sure why. While it's not in any way deterring my desire to play the game, it would've been nice to have seen them improve rather than step back. Really, it's a minor step. Not enough to hate. It's definitely better-looking than PS1 games (so don't listen to that hating review). But Bioshock is more about the atmosphere, the feel of the city as you explore, the creep factor, the curious little sights here and there. It's definitely worth a buy.

Oh, I haven't checked out the multiplayer yet, but everyone I've talked to that has the game has said it's a blast and that they've spent hours on end lost in multiplayer. Welcom to Rapture..."
5.0	Not heavy duty but serves the purpose well. Happy with purchase
5.0	Bought this for my son, but my daughter absconded with it.  She loves the blinking lights. Preferred by daughters.

5.0	I was a little skeptical with all the hype for this game. But it is really a master piece, I really loved the game...I loved it so much that I went back to play Witcher 2 for xbox 360. Really look forwarding for the blood and wine extension. I really loved the game
5.0	"The entire Guild Wars 1 series is amazing and still going to this day.  After taking a break from it for about a year and playing Guild Wars 2,  I am enjoying this game all over again like I did when it first came out.  There is just so much to enjoy about it.
Even once you hit max level,  there are elite skills to be capped,  gear to strive for, weapons to locate and heroes to build.  People are starting to come back to this game after being somewhat disappointed or bored with GW2.  Kamadan, Great Temple of Balthazaar often has plenty of players in it as well as Jade Quarry.  I hope this game makes a comeback and more content is added due to people slowly transitioning back to it. Making a comeback!"

5.0	I've always wanted a camo pattern legit official PS controller. It's the coolest thing ever. I lost it in my carpet right away. As for the terrible reviews... Buy from a legit seller (i.e. Amazon) and you will not be disappointed. Oh and to make them work properly, charge completely before you ever press the PS button. Awesome
5.0	A must have for any Wii U owner. We have 2. The second best controller ever made! So easy to just connect to Wii U to charge- I love how Nintendo started that trend! Feels great in your hands and is very lightweight! - you could game for hours and your hands will never even know!! Very durable and attractive! - Nintendo quality is always top notch!!! The second best controller ever made

5.0	If you are a RPG game fan,I almost garentee you will like this game. The storyline is addicting and the graphis are awesome! The music is good too. I would not recommend this to younger kids,but around 12 and up. The instruction manual goes a little too much into detail and may seem to make the game confusing. The game is very fun!!5 stars!! VERY Addicting Game
5.0	Great Game for final fantasy Fan! YES to the Game!
5.0	Have your fingers ever slipped off of the bottom L2 or R2 button triggers during a gaming session, especially in crazy gaming situations? Well if you have like I did many times before I bought this product then I understand your frustration and I am happy to say that these dual trigger accessories are the answer to that annoying problem. Now I know what you are probably thinking, $5 for 2 pieces of plastic? I know because I thought the same thing when I first heard of this product, although I decided to give them a try since I was aggravated enough in dealing with the accidental design flaw in which sony was trying to make their new controller look sleeker but only made me aggravated every time when my fingers slipped off of the bottom L2 and R2 trigger buttons on the dual shock 3 controller. And at first when I bought them I said to myself these are not going to stay on, but surprisingly they do fit and stay snuggly on both of the L2 and R2 trigger buttons on the dual shock 3 controller. These trigger accessories are great, and makes things easier when playing games, especially driving games. And if you ever want to take them off it is not that hard to take them off or put them on and keep them on as they are designed that way. If you have a ps3 and play games on it then I recommend getting this product. I bought this product at a retail store for $4.99 + tax, but you can also buy this product online. In my opinion these trigger accessories for the dual shock 3 controller are essential and I wondered why I waited so long to get these. Well worth the money and essential to anyone that owns and plays games on the ps3.
5.0	This food is great I only buy organic seed though my birds only get a little seed in their diet but they love it and it lasts a long while for thee keets. Freash and organic 2 important things to me.
5.0	If you waited on D3, you don't need to wait any longer.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up, it's a great 4 player game and easily the best 4 player co-op game of the PS3's life cycle. it's a great 4 player game and easily the best 4 player ...
5.0	Excellent Five Stars
5.0	"The Greatest Game of all time. Got this game back in 1997. It was the sole reason I got a Playstation. Since then I have played and beaten it about 40 times or so. The characters, the magic system, the beautiful pre rendered steam/cyber punk world, the Story/lore, the mini games and sidequests, and the replayability are all on God Level.

It is right up there with other RPG greats like Final Fantasy 6, Chrono Trigger, Dragon Quest 8, Xenoblade Chronicles and so on and so forth.

Now I wait for the remake I have been waiting for since the PS2 days. No matter how good it is though nothing can replace the original, it's a Masterpiece. Legen...wait for it....DARY!"
5.0	Very useful for contollers Five Stars
5.0	I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reasons.  I can tell you having only gotten to see a few episodes of the series total that the show itself is  entertaining. love the seres
5.0	"I LOVE THIS GAME! My love affair with Animal Crossing started many years ago on my Nintendo DS. I was uber-stoked when this edition came out for my Wii. Most reviews are quite accurate in stating that they have not really made many upgrades to the game at all other than the addition of being able to go to the ""city""... However; for those of you fellow nerds who love to waste hours planting/watering flowers and fishing - this is for you! Wii Animal Crossing: City Folk"
5.0	I played this series since PS one version came out that I can access and play. Four disc swapping and still was fun then. Even though story line is same new graphics and the way weapons move in new editions keeps me attached to the series. So far so amazing to play the online co op battle mode. This is great edition to the series. Fun Fun Fun
5.0	we have played this game over and over and it is really fun for the whole family and its great exercise as well we love it!!!
5.0	perfect Five Stars
5.0	I looked for awhile for a good 3DS XL case , and this is the best one, it's not the most portable case (it's bigger) but it is very protective. Also this fits many sizes of DS's. Although not stated it fits the Nintendo 3DS XL perfectly, technically any case that fits the DSi XL will fit the 3DS XL because the DSi XL is larger overall, this came very quickly, I got mine for $12.00 if you don't mind buying it used, I got mine like new, the only thing missing was the stylus which I didn't mind. --The best case you can get for the 3DS XL--
5.0	This game is soooo awesome!  Though I do have to wonder why Neku acted so cold toward everyone...but I'm not really a people person either.  But the game is the best!  And it was cheap too!  It's always Square Enix that has the best games to offer! Awesome has a new word...and it's called AWESOMENESS!!!
5.0	A very good fit. Comfortable. Pocket clip on volume control keeps it out of the way. Only drawback is when moving hear some plastic popping in the back ground. They were to arive on a tuesday. Got them the saturday before.
5.0	"I am a huge fan of substantive interactive dynamic stories in general.  Dragon Age Origins is the first that I found for video games and simply I think anyone who allows themselves to enjoy it, will.

As technology as advanced, the quality of these types of video games has exploded.  BioWare has become the industry leader making these games.  Though I pray daily for other companies to begin challenging them for that title.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Age-Origins-Ultimate-Edition-Playstation-3/dp/B0045ZIEPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition - Playstation 3</a>&nbsp;was first conceived as an Intellectual Property {I.P.} that BioWare could own outright;  Instead of pulling teeth negotiating use of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Player-s-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons/dp/0786965606/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Player's Handbook (Dungeons & Dragons)</a>&nbsp;I.P. from Wizard of the Coast/{Hasbro}.

Developing a new I.P. can be tricky because fans of this genre want historical and character depth in the stories that are told.  That means creating a historical timeline of events similar to what Marvel has done with their movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America-The-First-Avenger/dp/B005ZCXPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain America: The First Avenger</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy/dp/B00OBW0IUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Hulk/dp/B001IAME78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Hulk</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B001FD5KJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-s-The-Avengers-HD/dp/B0099RFVXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel's The Avengers [HD</a>], & Thor so far.  However, abundantly delevered what video gamers want in 2009.

The world of Thedas {Dragon Age} is rich in historical and character depth.  Most importantly the game has inspires gamers to spend hundreds of hours in playtime by replaying the game with different characters and making different choices.  Participants are able to choose different species for their protagonist and different unique histories and starting points for each character history.  The game has myriad endings that can easily be fundamentally different from each other instead of a few minor differences.

Despite all of these choices, the main and side stories lead the audience to love and care for the characters they have developed.  We want them to succeed and dream of choices we will make in the next mission the next time we play.  As described the entire game is implicitly compelling in myriad ways.  There is action, adventure, drama, and especially romance.  All of these elements help the game appeal to a wide variety of sapients and attract new gamers to grow the niche further.

Obsidian, is an absolutely, abundantly, and indomitably outstanding video game producing studio.  In the beginning, they were the ones to inspire BioWare to delve deeper into this genre of video games.  However, seemingly the size of their company currently limits development of new video games.

Bethesda is apparently prohibitively fearful of allowing their audience to explore romantic drama in the stories of their own video games.  Good examples of this are The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Legendary Edition & The Elder Scrolls Online Imperial Edition [Online Game Code].  However, their products are similar with interactive stories and dynamic stories that change the game based upon the participant's choices.

Atlus seems to understand how to write interactive stories with romance, such as Catherine - Playstation 3 which serves more as an erotic video game and abundantly defines why parents should pay attention to the ESRB rating of video games.  I am unsure what is keeping them from delving further with more substantive fantasy stories.

Telltale games has their video game adaptation of The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season - PlayStation 4 & The Walking Dead: Season 2 - PlayStation 4 however similar to Bethesda their interactive story so far has been without any romantic drama;  Of course, Telltale has the valid excuse of the Survival Horror genre being difficult to offer romantic options.

According to the initial product description Telltale's The Wolf Among Us breaks that mold and does have romantic options in their interactive and dynamic story.  As a rabid fanboy of this genre, I choose to support any video game maker exploring it the way I want.  Therefore I preordered the game and I look forward to playing it in a few days.  I pray and hope that it abundantly tides me over until Dragon Age Inquisition - PlayStation 4 Deluxe Edition arrives.

As a quality game Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition - Playstation 3 is still felicitously worth buying even five years after its initial release.  Fans of interactive stories should easily accept the dated graphics to experience the outstanding story of the game.  I suspect that the game will be worth playing for years in the future.  Therefore I hope that BioWare actually chooses to reopen work on Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition - Playstation 3 and offer a remake for the Playstation 4.  There is plenty of opportunity to explore Ferelden further even if the continuation involves creating a new protagonist from the initial protagonist's family legacy.

5.0	"It's true, this ""Battle Chest"" holds the original ""WarCraft: Orcs and Humans"", ""WarCraft II: The Tides of Darkness"", and the WC2 Expansion ""WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal"". Don't come expecting the greatest of graphics, this game was made what feels like forever ago. (I played this in High School back in 1997 - Sophmore Year.) Come for the story, the characters, and the games that brought WarCraft to the world and paved the way for World of WarCraft. Medivh, Gul'dan, Ner'Zhul, Garona, Alleria, Khadgar, Turalyon, and so many more are featured in this game and will give WoW fans a better understanding of WoW Lore.

I also recommend the novels that also tell the story of these games. You will better appreciate the time and years of work that went into making WarCraft the wonder that it is today. WoW Starts Here!!"

5.0	Works the same as the American version and costs a lot less. This is the best option for the price in my opinion. Works with American Wii's
5.0	"Guitar Hero: On Tour- 4.5 Stars (rounds up to 5)
 Wow. When this game was announced last fall, many speculations were running through my mind, wondering if it was even possible. IT WAS. The team's work payed off with GH:OT, making it as close as physically possible to the console versions. Between the great graphics, awesome sound, best (and largest) song selection for DS, and near perfect controls, for $50, you can't go wrong with this purchase.
  Considering the maximum gamecard capacity, this game is packed to the rim with features, unlockables, modes, and tracks. Guitar duels are a riot (especialy in multiplayer), career mode is short, but sweet, and just the controls themselves are fun. Although many may ridecule the song selections, I rather enjoy nearly every song (yes, even 'All Star').
  Unfortunately, it does have a couple of annoying setbacks. As enjoyable as the Guitar Grip may be, when into a Guitar Hero frenzy, your hand, fingers, and wrist will cramp unforgivably, forcing you to rest. Also, after playing a song or two, the guitar grip seems to start to gradually slip out of my DS (the same goes for your pick during a long song). And as much as the team has already given to us, and expansion slot for extra songs would have been nice. Perhaps we'll see these fixed for the FALL edition of GHDS.
  And yet, despite these gripes, I just LOVE this game. When it come to the Music/Rythm genre on the DS, no other game can top this one. Yet. Did You Wonder if it Was Even Possible?"
5.0	Fast shipping, super product. super product.
5.0	This game is pretty hard & challanging. it took me almost an hour just to defeat Sabertooth. It is a fun game and it does get frustrating at times. There is this one level in act two where you can't get noticed or the game will be over, and that level is pretty hard. But i have enjoyed it so far. And i'm a big X-Men fan. So if you like the X-Men this will be a game that you'll like. And this game dosen't go buy the movie at all. Well if you rent it enjoy X2: Wolverine's Revenge,

From what I can gather, these guys own a big Chinese mouse manufacturing company, and these are basically ""house brand"" mice. Like if you slapped a different logo and color and shape, with the same guts,  you'd pay 5x as much. I'm pretty sure that's what it is. Whatever, it a great mouse. No better mouse for the money."

5.0	This game provides non-stop heart pounding survival horror action, amazing controls, great use of gun accessories for the Wii, amazing graphics, and a solid horror story.  This game keeps you on your toes and plays along perfectly.  Great game can't wait for the next one. Another flawless Wii game.
5.0	I've had the sixaxis since the PS3 first came out.  I finally upgraded one of my controllers to the dual shock but I like how light the sixaxis is.  I also feel like the battery lasts longer on these.  Would recommend one of these over the dual shock. Still going strong...
5.0	"Right now, this is one of the best controllers you can find to use with Windows 10.  It feels great in your hand, has a nice build, and works with the vast majority of games.  If you add some third party software to the mix you can even remap the buttons and emulate a mouse with it.

One thing to keep in mind.  This comes in two packages.  One has the wireless dongle and the other has a wire.  Both packages include the wireless controller.  If you want the one with the dongle to make it fully wireless with the PC, you might be able to save a few bucks by buying the version with the wire and then buying the dongle separately.  It sounds counter intuitive, but it's how it is at the time of this review.  See for yourself:

Wireless Package - 79.99

Controller With Wire Package - 47.99
Wireless Adapter - 24.99

That's seven bucks in your pocket by buying them separately.  On top of that, you have the wire for when your batteries die but you want to keep playing! Awesome Controller - Compare Package Prices!"
5.0	Just got them today. I bought two.. But my son loves his new remote and now he has another one so he can play with his brother or friends. Will update later after his played with them for hours. Synced after i put in new battries in and works great with my sons wii.
5.0	Just got this game today and the nostalgia kicks in :) I have seen my bro play it so many times and when he didn't have it anymore, I had to buy this game and play it for myself :) I want to try and play every single game in the series :) Metal Gear Solid!
5.0	Works great and install is easy, cause it just sits on top of your TV, and the angle is easily adjustable! I use it so people can watch me while I stream games, and it's a nice camera and get's the job done. Nice camera for streaming
5.0	Quick ship son loves this son loves this game
5.0	The controls are responsive, and the side grips help keep hands dry, feels very comfortable.  The lighting effect is cool, and can change to several different colors, to reflect your mood, or the game you are playing. tight
5.0	Love this game, played it on my PS3 console. It is controller supported. Must have to any TPS collection
5.0	"400 dollars at launch, no backwards compatibility, only exclusive I wanted ended up being trash, and all the others getting PC releases too.
Should bought an xbone/10

Don't buy this.

unless you want to, that is; what do I know, I'm not you, I can't make this choice for you, I mean come on, you know if you want this or not. 400 dollars at launch, no backwards compatibility, only ..."
5.0	"I have been playing mortal kombat since i was small and my mom bought me that first one i have been playing it ever since so i was a bit iffy just playing with only 2 people from mortal kombat when my husband bought it home for us to play together, we're just use to the straight up one on one fighting but i gotta admit playing it was great, fun and playing it with my husband made it even better...

I like the missions having to go through the protals to and from the other mortal kombat players you meet along the way it was a good game no complaints from me... Me and my husband loved it"
5.0	I loved this game!  I would play it like crazy!  It's not an easy game and it's not one you solve after a day or two it takes a long time and you have to be pretty smart to figure out some of the things but it's alot of fun overall! Great Game!
5.0	I'm not sure why everyone thinks the cord is short I can charge and sit in my recliner no problem. It has not broken and I've stepped on it had the cats rip it out of my controller and xbox running by and have dropped it on numerous occasions. I give it 5 stars just for that. It also charges great. Great product.
5.0	"I got this game a while ago when I was shopping for something else entirely and I just happened to see it on a shelf.  It seemed like a good game and I bought it since I likes my Dragonball Z.

  First off, this is how a DBZ game should be.  You certainly feel like you are in the show.  Budokai was cool but the charcters moved very stiffly and slow.  The only problem is now you move much too quickly and it's hard to control your guy at times.  Also, the amount of characters avaialable to play with(after you've done a quick sweep of story mode that is) is quite large.  Super Vegeta is my favorite.

  Also there is a rather beefy customization option available.  You upgrade your characters with z items.  Though it's a bad that you have to upgrade every form of goku, vegeta etc with different items.  For example if you give super saiyan goku a +2 attack item then super saiyan goku 3 won't have it.  Basically what I'm getting at is if you want to play as a variety of characters then you're gonna need a lot of z items or do a lot of item switching.

  The downside which has been mentioned is the controls are somewhat stiff but I still like the attempt to make the game intense like the anime.  The game also has it's chokepoints.  The single most annoying thing I have done at least recently is surviving two minutes against Kid Buu as Vegeta. It's not Super Battletoads hard but its close. Also, there is not much emphasis or need to engage in fisticuffs.  Most fights are won by charging up and letting rip with your special moves as soon as you can.  And then not letting them get in close.  The only time I fight hand to hand is when the enemy closes in and I have to knock them back.  Still, for all it's flaws I love this game.  Grab it and enjoy wailing on people as Goku/Vegeta Super Saiyan 4 My new favorite DBZ game!"
5.0	"Nintendo is one for constant hardware iterations, and they finally got the 3DS right with the New XL. Despite the confusing name, it actually does feel all new. The entire system is streamlined and it feels like Nintendo finally wrapped their minds around how they want the 3DS to be, and this is the final (hopefully) result. All of the features implemented into the 3DS up until now are present on the 3DS from hardware changes to software.

The first thing you will notice, obviously, is how big the unit is. I had a DSi XL and while it as bigger the larger screen made games look pixelated. The New 3DS XL isn't just a 3DS on steroids like the 3DS XL, it has all new features. Secondly, is just how sleek it looks. This is probably Nintendos sexiest handheld since the GBA SP. The rounds edges accompanied by the slim form factor just made it look sleek and impressive. Once you flip it open you will notice somethingwhat the hell is that rubber nubby thing on the top right corner? Its the C-Stick and I put quotes there because its not a stick but a nub, hell not even that. Its like a rubber nipple. The addition of a second stick is an absolute #1 must have on the 3DSI cant make this point any more clearer. Nintendo pretty much took the Circle Pad Pro and melted it onto the New 3DS XL as it includes the ZR and ZL buttons as well. The first handheld with two shoulder buttons built innow we just need more games that support them! More on that later.

Everything else is pretty much in its proper place button wise except there is not longer a WiFi switch on the side. WiFi is a software toggle now and the power, wifi, and charging lights are all grouped up in a row on the bottom right corner. You can see them easily with the lid flipped down. One of my favorite features is the SpotPass LED located on top of the right hinge. It lights up green when a SpotPass notification is available and is also your low battery light. The Game Card slot is tucked away on the bottom of the device along with the stylus and power button. The power button is a small button under the LED lights so you don't accidentally hit it.

I actually like the new 3D slider on the righ of the screen. Its symmetrical to the volume slider, like older models, but is more flush with the system and doesnt feel so cheap. One minor gripe is that the New 3DS XL does not use a standard SD card so the one in your older system is useless here, instead it comes with a 4GB microSD card and it is not accessible from the outside. You must unscrew the bottom plate to get to it near the battery. That part I don't really care about as most people will either never need to upgrade because they buy physical games, or you will upgrade once with a 32 or 64GB card if you are a digital person. There is also an NFC battery in this thing for the amiibos, but everyone will use that feature. Thats pretty much all there is to the new hardwarewell its actually a complete 90% overhaul but for the better.

Lets talk about the screens. They look great, while not as high resolution as you think, they work fine for 3DS games. For people with bigger hands the XL size is perfect and honestly the 3D is much easier on your eyes as its a bigger target. The 3D effect is much improved thanks to the head tracking built into the system via IR sensor. Now its not flawless, it doesnt work well when you are laying down and gets finicky in the dark if you move around too much. The hardware has a faster CPU, mainly doubled that of the original model, as well as double the RAM and 1GB internal memory. The CPU is clocked at 268Mhz and is dual-core with one core reserved for OS operation. It also has 256MB of RAM and 10MB VRAM. You may laugh at this compared to say the Vita, but Nintendo is known to keep older hardware for cheaper prices. Thats not to say the New 3DS could have benefited from an entire new chipset as seen in newer phones, which makes this the biggest downfall of the New 3DS.

Playing games on the system using the C-Stick is weird at first. It doesnt move around as it reacts to pressure. You just push itmush it? You move your thumb around on it and the camera turns, its hard to explain but it works well and after an hour you forget its not a moveable stick. Playing games like Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Resident Evil Revelations with it makes the games that much more enjoyable. The extra shoulder buttons are a little hard to get to as they aren't contoured into the system, but rather just sit on top and are rather small. The other complaint is that this system does not come with a charger. Yeah, you heard me. Nintendo banked on previous 3DS owners buying this system, so you're going to have to thrown down $10 or so for a generic charger if you have never owned a 3DS before. Stupid move on Nintendos part, but theres nothing we can do.

With all that said the New 3DS XL is what the 3DS should have been in the beginning. The larger screens look crisp and bright, the battery last a whopping 7.5 hours (with WiFi off and power save mode on) during most games, the faster CPU will bring in better looking games, and the entire form factor is sleek and gorgeous. Fantastic system, this is the 3DS perfected"
5.0	Item showed up day earlier then expected  fun game :D Five Stars
5.0	"Just in case that didn't quite sink in..  RAINBOW BOMBS!  With this Skylander you can strike fear in the hearts of your enemies by blowing them away with exploding balls of color.  She begins with the aforementioned bombs, and the ability to create electrified clouds that stay for a moment before dissipating.  I found these particularly effective at taking out enemies that you need to chase.

As with all of the Skylanders, this figure is well made and looks really nice.  So you get a cool figure alongside a great character that you can use in any of the three Skylanders games.  So this is highly recommended. This skylander has RAINBOW BOMBS!"
5.0	Only played the demo njoyed it so much I had to buy the game. Haven't played the whole game yet, but really liked it. Great game.
5.0	I don't have Mario Maker so I've not used it. It's still in the box. I bought it because it's cool looking and have it displayed with my other Amiibo. I bought it because it's cool looking and have it displayed with my other Amiibo

5.0	omg just what i needed you don't need any drivers no headache just plug it in and it works like a ps3 controller best purchase i ever made! ... no headache just plug it in and it works like a ps3 controller best purchase i ever made
5.0	Just finished chapter 1 and I can already say I love this game. Voice acting is great, the narrative is awesome and I sense there will be replay value (if I want to 100% the game). Now when am I going to slay those vampires... Great!
5.0	Four Swords Adventures is definitely a great buy. It's interesting gameplay coupled with multiplayer modes and Tingle's tower minigames add to the replayability. The graphics suck, but that was only to fit all the gameplay... though I hate the level system as opposed to the world map but then again, some levels would be unaccessable... but anyway this game owns, you should buy it and show it to your friends, but if you don't have Gameboy Advances, the GBA/CGN Cable or friends... the replayability value drops by 1 point, it's still a solid game. Nice!
5.0	pulled out the wii and put it in my man cave, this is a great game to get the whole family involved! GREAT family fun!

5.0	If you like games such as Galactic Civilizations 2, Space Empires V, and Sword of the Stars then you must add Lost Empire to your collection! You will love this game! There are alot of things in this game that make it stand on its own. Leaders for example is an awesome idea, how they are implemented. They age and die after time then a new one will be randomly created at some time. The story mode in this game is all non-scripted and the galaxy is randomly generated no matter if you do story mode or custom game. So you can replay the story mode over and over. If you choose so, you can have a 5000 star random galaxy, kid you not! The AI is solid and plays the game well, the interface is easy to get around even when you have a large empire. One of the most addicting strategy games I have ever player. At last, looks like another space strategy classic is born. Excellent space strategy!
5.0	Good console Get item fast
5.0	The Vanguard Case is everything that was advertised and more. I took it with me at my deployment and it has been such a morale boost. I recommend this case for any gamer and military alike. The lifesaver of my deployment
5.0	"Lost my spare set of stock Zowie feet and my mouse was bottoming out right around the sensor area, which is a common issue as the stock feet are really thin. These glide a LOT smoother than the stock feet and it did take some getting used to in the beginning.

For those complaining about losing tracking, you probably have your LOD set too low or you stacked the feet instead of removing the old ones first. Could be that you also did not fit them properly into slots. I can say that these work perfectly fine on my FK2. I can say that these work perfectly fine on my FK2"

5.0	This item is a genuine Microsoft product... while it does look like it was some sort of bulk bin buy it is branded by Microsoft. This Item is everything I thought it would be!!!!
5.0	"I love stealth games. Especially the Tenchu series and the Hitman series. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is the  first in the Splinter Cell series that I have ever played, and I absolutely love it. The game play and stealth requirement is exactly what I was hoping for. The weapons arsenal is really cool, although I do wish for more incapacitating, non-lethal ammo, but that just adds to the challenge. And the game is quite challenging and full of fun challenges to solve. The story is cool and what you might expect from a ""special ops"" story these days. Terrorist groups trying to develop crazy weapons, double agents, etc. It's cool and fun.

In a nutshell I would recommend this game to anyone into serious stealth game play. Thrilling and Challenging Stealth Game"
5.0	This is a fun game that offers Arcade style graphics and a lot of game play. Not a bad title at all. Fun Game with lots of Arcade action
5.0	"I am totally blown away by todays technology! Imagine, being able to sit and enjoy a favorite, full-length, motion picture, like ""Shrek 2"" on your GameBoy Advance system! Well, you can!

Shrek 2. Rated PG. Starring Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrews, Antonio Banderas, John Cleese, Jennifer Saunders, Rupert Everett. Dreamworks Video. 92 minutes.

Enjoy the entire, full-length motion picture ""Shrek 2"", on your GBA. Perfect to take along on travel, vacations.

This happy customer gives this GBA Movie two thumbs way up! Shrek 2 - Full Length Video!!"

5.0	I am a Dead Space player since the first game.  I love to kill spatial monsters!, now I can complete the history. Kill monsters!
5.0	"This is an MMORPG, that reminds me a little of White Wolfs, ""World of Darkness"" storytelling series, in that it takes place in a world, much like ours, except the monster stories you heard about as a child, are real. Things do go bump in the night, and that monster you thought was living under your bed as a child, is probably still there, watching you as you sleep.

You choose one of three different factions, that really doesn't have much impact on your game, aside from preference. You still can interact with other factions, and even group up with them. You still hunt in the same zone as the other factions, and you even do the same tutorial level.

The game it's self has a deep and involved storyline that, depending on the area you are in, is inspired from varios authors ranging from King to Lovecraft. Fans of horror games will find so much to love about this title.

The controls are different from other MMORPGs, and it makes no attempt to be an Everquest clone like every other MMORPG out there. This is a double edged sword, in that it might make people who are afraid of new things hesitant to try this unique and remarkable title, but it also forges it's own identity, which is important for not just any game, but any product.

The controls and combat isn't the only thing different in this game, as I said it's a unique experience, and has an identity all on it's own. Yes, you do engage in combat, though more often than not, you will find yourself solving puzzles, using google as a research tool, and trying to solve mysteries that surround you, because like in the real world, not everything can be solved with violence.

The game is technically free to play, though you do have to buy the game(Sort of like Guildwars and guildwars2), so you don't HAVE to worry about monthly costs, which is a bonus if you are a gamer like me, that doesn't have a whole lot of free extra time on his hands. When you get some spare time, just hop in and play. Easy as that.

Bottom line, this is a game you should have in your collection. No matter what type of gamer you are, I am willing to bet you will find something in this title to keep you entertained. It's like a World of Darkness inspired MMORPG"
5.0	"Final Fantasy V Advance is one of my all time favorite video games. It is a remake of the 1992 Super Famicom game ''Final Fantasy V''.

This game has great gameplay, lovable characters, and the job system is so fun. I also love the fact that the dialogue and story are both lighthearted and have a Saturday morning cartoon feel to it.

This is a great sword and sorcery RPG. But I must say, if you decide to play this game, I recommend that you use a walkthrough, because it is easy to miss the important items. A super good fantasy/sword and sorcery RPG"
5.0	excellent product, I recommend it, it would buy Five Stars
5.0	Best FPS single-player. Mechanics are sound, graphics are solid and the scares are perfect. Best FPS single-player ever.
5.0	This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool. This is probabaly the best zelda game. Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game. If you haven't played this game, i don't know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link. Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link. This game is way better than majoros mask. If you still have 64 (get a gamecube, so you can play windwaker)you need to get this great game. THE BEST GAME FOR 64
5.0	gravity rush is my favorite game nexto gta sonic dbz daytona usa i love flying and Beating up bad guys i know i didn't want to buy vita but i hated watching gravity rush threw a window dam gravity rush why this game had to be good the buildings in the game are made out of granit something out of another country its hard todiscribe just love flying grabvity rush
5.0	"I got my CE from amazon this afternoon, and this is the nicest CE I bought this year comparing to the Fable 2 CE and GTA 4 CE. The CE package has a neat looking lunch box, you could either put it somewhere as a decoration or use it as the storage for small stuff. That Pipboy figure is a fine-maded bubblehead, kinda hilarious. There is also an artbook of 100 pages featuring the concept art in Fallout3, and a DVD of making of the fallout 3. I think the CE is totally worth the price especially now amazon is offering the $10 giftcard.

Now thinking about the game, maybe you would argue that this is just ""Oblivion with guns"", but this ""Oblivion with guns"" has more to offer than just ""Oblivion with guns"". It has a massive story(according the guide i received today, after you completed the game you got tons to do), also the SPECIAL is back! Pipboy is back. I cant help crying after i creating my character and seeing a whole new wasteland, which is far more detailed than the game I played 10 years ago. Maybe you would argue again, Bethesda is incapable of doing top-notch black humor like Black Isle, but the feels of exploring the wasteland is back, here I listed a few pros and cons

Pros
+ build of the whole wasteland
+ mission design
+ user interface
+ storytelling
+ Pipboy
+ tons of things to explore

Cons
- cant skip the VATS slow motion
- making choices won't affect whole game too much unlike previous ones

In general, I would recommend this game to those who love Oblivion. Highly recommend the CE"
5.0	Great Games Plays like a champ!!! Awesome
5.0	love it I love it
5.0	pleased with purchase Five Stars
5.0	It'is an excellent product, has been the best. if I'll buy any product like this repeat with you all the times as necessary. thanks a lot! My Best Buy
5.0	"A GameCube-exclusive, Resident Evil 4 had been one of those games stuck in development for what seemed like an eternity. Despite the delays and concerns about the games exclusive status on Nintendos platform (don't worry, it will be released on the PlayStation 2 before the end of the year), Resident Evil 4 is a superb game that re-invents the tried-and-true mechanics of the series in important, innovative ways plus, it's creepy as hell. Resident Evil 4 picks up after Code: Veronica, with Leon Kennedy (from RE2) now a government agent sent to rescue the presidents daughter who disappeared in Europe. Of course, her kidnapping is only a small part of the huge overall picture. The much-publicized absence of trademark zombies (and nemesis corporation Umbrella) was replaced by enemies that are far deadlier: crazed villagers and cultists (among others) who actually put up a fight. Enemies use explosives, weapons, and even bob and weave to dodge your attacks. They also set-up a variety of crude but effective booby traps. If the re-make of the first Resident Evil on the GameCube set a new visual standard for the series, then RE4 easily raises the bar. The game is gorgeous in a very effective way, with mist, rain, and other diverse weather effects coupled to immense detail. Static, pre-rendered backgrounds have been a love-hate relationship of the RE series, but number four wisely discards them with a new third-person view so you can see more of your surroundings, including attackers that may be lurking nearby.

RE was frequently frustrating due to the limits on the play system, but not here. Characters can vault over rails, jump through windows, and even engage in hand-to-hand fighting when dry on ammunition. Interwoven into the play mechanics are Action Button sequences twitch-finger situations where you must press the button prompt that appears onscreen (two buttons simultaneously, or one button rapidly). Simple controls keep the diverse functions under simple command, and the various inventories are easy to access and navigate, but the inability to reload weapons in the menu screen or while moving can be a real pain. Speaking of weapons, the game serves up an arsenal Solid Snake would envy: Machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, magnums, and other weapons can be obtained, and new ones can be purchased and upgraded by one of the many weapon Merchants at random spots throughout the game. If RE4 has any problem, it goes on a little too long (it spans two discs), with one boss battle and plot twist too many. However, there's an extensive reward system, including unlockable content that adds excellent replay value. It took time, but Resident Evil 4 finally arrived in glorious fashion, and fans of the series will be more than pleased. It's easily the best game in the series in recent years. Best in the series!!!!"
5.0	"My son and his friends think this is the coolest thing with the blue glow and seeing the internal components including the spinning metal to create the vibrations. This controller feels a little smoother and more comfortable than Microsoft's standard wireless controller. The configurable buttons on the back give a slight edge compared to moving your hand over to hit another button.

I thought it would be a pain to use a wired controller, but it has been fine. I suppose they could get pretty tangled if you had two of them, but we are using this controller along with a wireless controller when a second person is playing. All the kids go for the Afterglow controller first. It's really nice that we aren't constantly changing batteries like we have to do with the wireless controllers. Great wired controller"
5.0	"The beautiful HD Graphics will make your eyes water, blending hyperealism with Nintendo's staple of high saturated and colorful aesthetics.

The music is also beautiful, utilizing live orchestras and bands with a variety of instruments and styles to suit each course.

Most importantly, track designs are superior to all previous installments; thanks to the antigravity mechanic, courses have nearly zero boundaries.

The online is vastly improved as well. Taking notes from the 3ds version, which were well received.

MK8 brings back the charm that felt missing from MK7 and executed every technical and graphical component flawlessly.

Must purchase this game if you have a Wii U, or when you purchase one for Smash Bros 4, Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, SMT x Fire Emblem, Pokken Fighters among other highly antipated Wii U releases.

This game is largely responsible for re-instilled confidence in a successful future for the Wii U and Nintendo. The beautiful HD Graphics will make your eyes water"
5.0	Why did this series have to end? Awesome
5.0	muy buen gracias Five Stars
5.0	lol ok I love this game love it I love the fact that I can put someone on some cloths that I know I would not wear just to see how it looks on the over all it is a fun game I would tell someone to try it trendsetters
5.0	"Absolutely awesome game! The gameplay is tight and so much fun. It's a great story and the pacing of the game is just incredible. Never a dull moment and it keeps moving at breakneck speed. There are some truly amazing moments in this game! ""Uncharted"" fans finally have something that compares. It's not quite as good, but definitely in the same league.

The only negative would be I miss the ""Tomb Raiding"". There are very few puzzles and little exploration. She's now more of an action hero than ever before and gone are the nods to Indiana Jones. Also it's a real shame they made ""optional"" tombs. I missed some playing through. They should have made them part of the story as the game is relatively short.

This is the beginning of a great new era for this franchise and a VERY memorable gaming experience. A MUST PLAY FOR ANY TRUE GAMER!! Laura has never looked so good and the crush is on! GAME OF THE YEAR! So far..."
5.0	All the hate this game got before release was unfounded. I had a great time with it. Its one of the best looking games I've ever played on any system. The combat is fun and has enough nuance to stay interesting through the entire game. I also thought the story was fine. It's what you would expect in a Gladiator homage. Bottom line is it's a fun game. Brutal fun
5.0	i like playing this game.. i played the first and now this one so yeah im getting the 3rd bioshock as well an i hope they make a 4th give this game an if you did play the first an have not played this one yet your in for a awasome gameplay.. get this game
5.0	This game lives up to its title. It's a lengend among games. One of the darkest and most tear jerking story's I've played. I would say it's better than dragon age inquisition but that my opinion. Buy this game! Best game of its generation.
5.0	My PSP fits great in it! Five Stars
5.0	The only thing I didn't like about this network adapter (besides the fact that its 802.11g) is the fact that it didn't come with the 360.. most people don't have network cable in their living room (at least anyone that I know). Should have come free
5.0	I have had this product for over 2 years. It works great, i haven't had a single problem with it, and it is definitely well worth the price! It works great, i haven't had a single problem with it
5.0	Excellent screen protector. Five Stars
5.0	"For $20, this is a steal of a deal. I've had this keyboard for over a year now, and I still haven't had any major problems with it. I love the cool, slick design of this keyboard and the blue-colored swappable gaming keys are really nifty. The only gripe of mine is that the backspace key is ridiculously small (same size as most letter keys); for this problem, I ended up using the blue swappable left arrow key so it would stand out to me when playing games or typing something (just a tip for those who are also annoyed with this problem). Other than the small backspace key, I have no gripes with this keyboard.

Overall, this is an excellent product. It's a low price for a great keyboard that provides everything you'll need in a gaming keyboard. Great keyboard for the price"
5.0	Great product for a great price! Great product for a great price!
5.0	Great service! There is nothing that needs to be improved at all. Will buy from again sometime in the near future. Great
5.0	"Works with GBA SP(Gameboy advance SP) and original DS, worth the price on here of $4 and some change including shipping. Charges my SP with no problems, don't have the first DS so can't rate that- but it works perfect for what i bought it for. Thanks to Swag Bucks, for the giftcard to buy this, i was able to get this shortly after purchasing my second GBA SP(first one is in storage in NY where i moved states from and i bought the 2nd because i got 12 games including some manuals though many extra manuals for games the thrift store didn't have and also 2 movie cartridges having 2 cartoon episodes each for $30 offline without the charger).

This won't work with older game boy systems(as they used batteries), and i don't know for sure but i don't think it supports the game boy micro. It does not support DS Lite through 2DS to my knowledge, so if you have one of those systems(DS Lite, DSi, 3DS, 3DS XL and 2DS) research before you buy this for one of those systems. If your traveling outside the US for vacation or something you will need a plug adapter to plug this in of course, but other than that this is all you should need as far as home/hotel charging needs. Also if your car is not newer and don't have an outlet to plug-in devices, you may want to purchase a car charger. For most people though, this charger and some games and/or movie cartridges(movie cartridges are only for game boy advance but you can use it on the game boy slot on the first DS) should be enough. Power charging cable/cord"
5.0	"I'm not much of a mario kart fan, as i like to play more realistic racing titles, but this game has a special place in my heart. What do you do when you have a whole bunch of mario kart titles, a new game, and crazed fans? Combine them! -ok, maybe not the fan part, but they sure did put in a boatload of tracks from the old mario kart titles, as they did before- so nothing new. I really don't know what makes this game so darn unique.. I just fell in love with it! This game is a Blast when you get friends to play with you on other DS's. I think i love it so much because its so easy to control, and its portable, i play it everywhere i go!
Bored? Too much pokemon? Tired of CoD and Halo and Battlefield? Dont like those realistic racers? Love mario? All of this equals mario kart DS. One of the best mario karts out there, my favorite one in my opinion! My favorite mario kart- no joke!"
5.0	"Just got this game today! I absolutely love it.

Pros: Everything about this game oozes artistic thoughtfulness from the voice over to the customizable characters and backgrounds. The gameplay is extensive; it gives you the options of playing on customized maps from other players or pre-made areas and with or without other online players. Great for longevity.  Personalization (so far) feels endless in this game.

Sacboy/girl is cute! ^_^

Cons??: Look elsewhere if you are wanting some deep, enthralling story-line. Beautiful Sacboy/girl :)"

5.0	"This game has great music! Gameplay is similar to other tactical RPGs like Tactics Ogre, FF Tactics but less similar to Fire Emblem.

Unlike other Suikoden games, you cannot recruit 108 characters, you are limited to 60 in this game but honestly, I do not think you will notice. You can build your base with your recruits, just like other Suikoden games.

Really looking forward to this game. Great Strategy RPG"
5.0	"I missed most of last generation on the PS2, so I'm just catching up on some big hits from last generation. Since I bought a PS3 a couple months back, I figured I needed to add these games to my collection. Both really turned out nice on the PS3, and the Santa Monica Studio did a nice job.

Graphics are pretty good for both games. Yes, it is a port of the PS2 games, but with them re-mastered, it almost looks like it was made for the PS3, from the start. Both run nicely at 60 FPS and in 720p.

Gameplay is overall great, with some rare hiccups. I had some issues with falling through the map a couple of times, and I wish they would have given the player control over the camera. The games themselves do a great job with the camera, but I did die a number of times due to the camera. Overall though, everything was pretty solid.

The sound was great. I was listening through 5.1 surround sound. I could tell a difference between the demo for God of War 3, that comes with it, but hey, it still sounds pretty good.

Overall, these two are great games and if you haven't played them, and have a PS3, you might want to think about picking this up. I voiced some problems above but both God of War 1 & 2 are just so epic that a couple problems don't detract from what are a couple of great games. A Couple of Great Classics"
5.0	fun Five Stars
5.0	I wasn't a fan of the game but they are closing the servers for the game so if I want to have the trophies for this game its now or never because in may of 14 you will not be able to get the online trophies! Gran Turismo 5 - Playstation 3
5.0	"I've been playing WOW for a long time, and it is a fine game in its own right, but lately it's become WAY too easy.

Rift borrows on the standards set by WOW, then amps it up a notch. The graphics in Rift are leagues above WOW, though more ""real"" fantasy than WOW's.

You can't take for granted that you'll survive every quest without a strategy. The rifts that open up add a level of suspense to the game. You can loot multiple mobs with a single click.

Lots of different things to do, lots of different currencies, and some fun tradeskills (the only ding I'd give is that you have to have a tradeskill *exactly* at the threshold level in order to move up. For example, if you need 75 to buy the next level, you have to return to a trainer the minute you hit 70). Also, there aren't enough portals around so lots of travelling.

The only con I can see to the game so far is that putting together groups for instance is ""old school"". There's no kind of dungeon finder, which can make it tough getting a group. Fun from the start"
5.0	great story, good gameplay, its only weak point is the length of history .. but still excellent. Great Game
5.0	This game is fantastic and Rockstar did their damdest to fit a lot of stuff on 1 small disc.  This game walks all over the GTA game that was released on the GBA by a long shot.  Gameplay is open ended as always and so far difficulty is not too bad.  The controls will take some getting used to but you can switch from using the analog nub to using the d pad if you wish.  I am very impressed with the graphics and sound quality isn't too bad.  Now I'm not sure but have read that in order to access the custom soundtrack abilty you have to reach level 20 before you can access the feature.  I would give this a soild 9 just for the gameplay alone.  One downer for me Toni and Donald Love are voiced by other actors and not by Michael Madesen or Kyle Maclachlan but I still give this 2 thumbs up.  Bravo Rockstar. GTA invades the PSP
5.0	"I was originally planning to review Super Smash Bros. Melee longer ago, but didn't feel like it was necessary due to the fact that there's over a THOUSAND people here on Amazon that's said their praises already. But you know what? Seeing as the new addition to the franchise is just a mile away, I think it's time I make this official: Even though there was only a two-year gap between the original Nintendo 64 classic and this, Super Smash Bros. Melee became a legendary piece of Nintendo history.

The game may have been released in 2001 (THIRTEEN YEARS AGO!!!), but can you even tell? I bet you if it was released today, it still would have earned a spot in Nintendo gamers' hearts everywhere! Starting straight at the opening FMW, this is a magnificent-looking game, filled with dynamic fighting arenas and dozens of intriguing details on every character and object there is in the game! From the pleasantly colorful Green Greens to the epic, intense Mute City, these arenas come in all sorts of flavors! They all fit these new graphics like a glove! Feeling nostalgic? Don't worry! You can even unlock a couple of the original Smash Bros.'s stages!

That's one amazing thing about this game. The sheer amount of unlockables that beg to be discovered makes the original Smash Bros. feel strikingly light on content! A lot of these are trophies, which are really just nice to look at and check out their descriptions to see what game each one is from and what they're meant to do in their games. If you're not building up a small Nintendo museum, though, you're digging for buried treasures like new dynamic stages and characters for the overall roster. The selection of characters in this game is incredibly diverse and fun to play around with. You have all the characters that were in the previous Smash, and MUCH more on top! Default newcomers include Bowser, Peach, Zelda, and the flippin' Ice Climbers! But then as the unlockable characters get fished out, you see shocking inclusions like Dr. Mario, Ganondorf, Mewtwo, Falco, and even Marth and Roy! And yes, each character has at least a couple of new moves in store.

The gameplay is even more frantic than before. The pace has been upped by a lot actually, making for much quicker and more sweat-inducing matches. During play, there are many different things that could change up the fight. There is a load of new items to use such as a Barrel Cannon, Bunny Hood, Cloaking Device, Freezie, Metal Box, Parasol, etc. Not to mention the arenas themselves would also likely provide a gimmick or two of their own. Whatever you do, try not to fall into the fast-moving river in Jungle Japes! But everything is still fair play. In fact, fans argue that Melee is the best in the series for skill-based matches, and I'm not gonna lie; the control is totally superb, complemented perfectly by the characters' weights and the game's pace. Plus, it feels so good to hit your opponents, especially with the Gamecube controller's rumble support!

Now let's talk about game modes. This was the original Smash Bros.'s weak point. Aside from the Vs Mode, there was just one single-player mode (Classic Mode) that, while structured like an arcade fighting game, uses the same characters and stages for its lineup every playthrough. Here? A BUNCH OF NEW MODES! AND CLASSIC MODE GETS RANDOMIZED! If the Classic Mode wasn't enough for single-player cravings, you also get a kooky Adventure mode with levels that you platform through (not without typical Smash battles, though), Event Matches with unique and interesting setups (EX: Play as a giant DK and fight a giant Bowser on the city stage, Fourside), a Home Run Contest where you bat a sandbag into the air, a Multi-Man Melee where you fight dozens upon dozens of wire frame fighters, and an unlockable All-Star mode where you fight every single character in the game under one life! Tell me this ISN'T overwhelming in the best way!

And yet that still isn't all. There's also a wide range of multiplayer change-ups that can make your average Smash Bros. matches all the more interesting. How about a mode where you're all giant or tiny? Or one where it's Sudden Death for every life? Or one where you're all invisible? Or how about you all have HP? Super Smash Bros. Melee aims to please, bringing you all these, and more. Unfortunately, I didn't find sped-up or slowed-down matches to be as exciting, and I also don't understand the point of modes like Single Button, Fixed Camera, or...Camera. Now that I think about it, there are some characters that aren't really as welcome as others. While Dr. Mario tends to be a stronger Mario in a way, and Ganondorf is similarly like that with Captain Falcon, WHY does Pichu damage itself whenever it uses electric attacks, and WHY is Young Link a weaker Link?!

But at the same time, would you believe that that's all I ever had to complain about this content-crammed disc? Everything else is nothing short of spectacular, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was still played to death by fans even after two more Smash Bros. games surface! To put it simply, this game is amazing. If you have the opportunity, do not pass up nabbing this game. Supercharged Smash Bros.!"
5.0	"OK, let me start this off by saying I'm a 55 year old woman.  I do NOT like ""organized exercise"" - i.e., going to the gym, classes, videos like Pilates etc.  In fact I rather detest them.  All THAT being said - I LOVE this game!

It gets me jumping, literally.  And I enjoy it.  Who would have thought THAT!  It's good not only for getting my heartrate up but it's also great for improving my balance.  There are a lot of games included, for one person or two - my son and I enjoyed playing together and laughed a lot.

I also have the Wii Fit and between these two games I can get a workout without suiting up, driving anywhere, becoming bored or otherwise irritating myself.  I highly recommend it for adults AND kids! Now this is FUN for your Wii!"
5.0	I think this is a really fun game. It has lots to do and some nice improvements over Age 2. The reason people don't seem to be liking this one so much is that it's nothing revolutionary. Age of Empires 2 was far better than other games in the genre, and AOE 3 isn't, but it's still a great game that's well worth the money. Age of Empires didn't get worse; other games got better

5.0	"I'm new to the whole Nintendo DS and Mario game scene. I have a GBA but was never really good at most of the games.

The one problem I've been having and the reason I entered 4 stars for how much fun it is....was because of trying to use the stylus for moving the characters around. I know you don't ""have"" to use it but I did try and it just didn't work so well for me, granted in some of the sections I had a hard time figuring out how to move them at ALL but I'm sure it's just me and I'm not coordinated enough. I've also gotten stuck on a couple areas where I can't figure out how to make it do what I want it to do. I know it says you can 'play as' all of the characters....but I'm still working on that part. I know what I need to do but not how to do it. :)

Otherwise - it's going to keep me occupied for a while. New player"
5.0	"This game is simply a blast. I am amazed that a PSP game is this good. As some people have mentioned, there are some loading issues, but they are not frequent and do not detract from the game. The control is very good, the force powers feel great. I say feel because it really does feel like you are wreaking some serious damage with the force!

The story is great, acting is great.

The extra stuff like the historic missions and the force duel modes, are great and are not found in the console versions. Lots of replay value here. There is multiplayer, but it is ad-hoc only, no infrastructure. However SONY has something in the works called Ad-hoc party, where if you have a PS3, you can use it to bridge over and play ad-hoc over the internet/infrastructure. So it will be some day soon.

A must buy for any PSP owner, very addictive game! The force is strong with this one"

5.0	"I ordered this a while back as I wanted to get into the AC series. I started AC1 and didn't finish it since I got so bored, never got around to AC2 until I bought an Xbox and it was free for gold members. I decided to play it and it was FANTASTIC.

AC2 was such a huge step up from AC1 and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So much so that I got all the achievements for it, lol. Highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun 3rd person action game. Awesome Game."
5.0	I am 20 years old and I'm really into gaming. Normally I get things like Call of Duty or Hitman or whatever but Amazon suggested this to me so I looked at a few videos showing the gameplay. I thought it looked really fun, different than my normal choices and maybe a little young for me, but I really enjoy it! Totally suggest it! 20 years old and I still love it

5.0	"Tokyo Racer Zero while in no way a substitute for the almighty Gran Turismo 3.  Does prove the fact that you don't need a degree in automotive engineering to play it.  The game is simplistic in its design, and reels you in with the lure of the dark sordid world of illegal street racing.  I guess that explains why none of the cars are licensed.  Oh well that fact aside (you can tell what the cars are supposed ot be without dropping names, anyways)The game's mechanics are easily understood, and then it is off to the highway to do battle with the 400 odd racers with some even odder nicknames.  The races are fun and challenging and it soons gets very addictive to win the pot to buy that new spoiler, or air dam you have been eyeing in the PARTS section.  I am only a short ways into the game, and already feel like i have gotten my purchase price in enjoyment out of it, and in the big picture that is what TRULY matters.
enjoy. Drop in, and DRIVE!"

5.0	"It's Dragon Ball and it's just all sorts of legit fun. The story IS essentially ""Dragon Ball Z but starring a self-insert character"" fanfiction, but it really shouldn't detract you from having a blast. The gameplay is smooth and the visuals are appealing, and the performance turned in by the DBZ voice over artists is really good. If you're a DBZ fan looking for something great to sink your hands into, this is the title for you. ... Dragon Ball and it's just all sorts of legit fun. The story IS essentially ""Dragon Ball Z but ..."

5.0	I was hooked on Myst the first time I played it.  After playing the sequel, Riven, I thought that there was no way that they could do a sequel that could top it.  In a way, I suppose they didn't.  When I first heard that Myst III was going to be made by another company I was scheptical, but they were obviously the right choice.  The graphics are fantastic, and the new engine is a great improvement over the static images.  The storyline is just as strong as it is in Riven and Myst.  I'm glad that someone finally got around to filling in some of the details of what it was that Sirrus and Achenar did to the worlds they visited, something that I always wish was explored more in the other games.  It is well worth the cost to play this worthy addition to the Myst Trilogy. An excelent continuation.
5.0	Great story, great gameplay and tones of replay ability. it took me about two weeks to pass the hole campaign along with all the side quests. longest story driven game i have played. lots of replay ability
5.0	Good, everything I expected no prloblems. Very close to the original, I suggest any SNK or Neo Geo fan buys it. It's a no brainer if you are and can't afford a AES Good
5.0	Love it, recommend seller love it

5.0	The screen and 3D on this is awesome!! Wow!
5.0	Got Fable III with my Xbox 360 and enjoyed it so much that I stopped playing it and got Fable and Fable II so I could play through the series from the start. I think Fable was originally released for the classic Xbox and was ported to the 360. As such, it is a little bit choppy at times and the sound occasionally makes an awfully harsh, intense white noise tear type sound for a quarter of a second, maybe every 10-15 minutes or so. It scares me every time because I'm never expecting it. It's definitely the game, I don't have this issue with any other games or devices through the same system. Pretty annoying, but obviously not a killer. The game is still very fun and I recommend it for those who enjoy playing entire series from the beginning, like me. Very fun, minor issues on Xbox 360
5.0	This is a really nice game for the younger crowd.  3-7 8yr olds could do it but it would be short for them. It is just like the movie 4yr old loves it beat it in 40 min but still goes back and plays it often a diego must diego
5.0	Got this game on Cyber Monday, one of the best I've played, just wrapped up the main quest (I play sparingly when we put the kids to bed). Appropriate for kids too, not very violent by modern game standards, language is clean, etc... My son likes the game but battling the machines are too advanced for him, more of a teenager to adult game. Good story, visually stunning, world felt alive, and shooting arrows and setting traps was different than the multitude of shooters out there. Aloy is nice, tough, fairly deep as a character. Hope there is a Horizon 2. one of the best I've played

5.0	"There are basically 2 types of fighting games out therem the ones that require a lot of stradgy (Virtua Fighter 4, Bushido Blade) and Button Mashers (Tekken, Dragon Ball Z Boudoki).  For most gamers they are one or the other.  Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance however is a first, in what I mean is that it is both a button masher and a stradgy style.  Let me explain.
Each Kombatant has 3 styles, two martial arts and one weapon.  Unlike #4 you don't lose your weapon when hit, and they don't do extreme amounts of damage when used.  However like the two styles they can be used to string comboes together.  However on the same token it is not neccesary to learn stradegy to beat story mode (it can help but not neccesary).
The story revolves around Shang Tsung and Quan Chi teaming up to take over both earthrealm and OUtworld.  After Vanquishing the two realms greatest champions (Shao Kahn and Lui Kang) they set forth a series of events to conquer the two relms.  Raiden relinqueshes his status as elder god to take on this force.  He allies himself with Kung Lao, Sub-Zero and his apprentice Frost, Sonya, Jax, and Johney Cage.  They then set forth to take out Quan Chi and Shang Tsung.  Also in the mix are the returning Scorpion, Kitana, Kano, and Cyrax.  The new characters are very diversed as well, from Bo Rai Cho and his prefered style of Drunken Fighting, to Mei Li who wants to rescue her clan, to Kenshi the blind warrior out to slay Shang Tsung, to Drahmin an Oni from the Netherrelm.
The one thing that did not change (besides the awsome Fatalities) is the fact that the sub boss (past guys were Goro, Kintaro, and Motaro) is the creature called Molock.  Molock has no specific skills, little fighting moves, but is very fast, relelntless, blocks a lot, and is powerful.  This makes for a very frustrating battle with some characters.  However with others it is a cake walk (well sort of).
Overall this is the best fighting game out there for the average gamer.  It doesn't require a lot of time memorizing skills and timing that virtua fighter 4 requires, yet at the same time is not as simplistic and a pushover that Tekken 4 is.  This is the must own fighting game for the average gamer. Best fighting game out there"
5.0	if you started off playing need for speed and jump to this game you are going to get mad fustrated and upset due to the racing physics. its old yet true to its name. you are going to have a hard time playing this game but its fun and a great challenge the REAL racing experience

5.0	"I've used a gazillion Turtle Beach headsets (X31, X32, X42. XP400, XP510, PX51, Z300, and a few wired ones).  I generally love the wireless (zero static) and the fit.  These do well in both regards, and they upgrade the appearance, build and functionality from all of these.

The presentation when you open the box is amazing (especially since I got these as warranty replacements/free upgrade for the Z300).  You really feel like you're opening up $300 headphones.  The look is angling more for the Beats/lifestyle headset crowd more than the gaming scene, which is fine by me, as I tended to remove the boom mics and use headsets as headphones for TV, movies, and music.  The marketing and manual is very clearly geared for Mac/iPhone users.  There's no mention of Android (worry not, these pair with any modern Bluetooth device) and Mac comes before PC in the instructions.  I use these with my work PC and my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 btw.

Taking these out of the box, you immediately appreciate the comfort and fit.  These definitely are the best fitting Turtle Beaches out there.  The weight is just right, and my enormous head never feels squeezed in.  The plastics look better than they feel, and all in all, it's not quite up to $300 headphone standards, but the aluminum is a nice touch.  Swap out aluminum for the plastics and you're hitting the mark.  The leatherette earpads are a bit of a challenge however.  They feel nice, and the shape works well for me, but they tend to cause sweating, even after just a few minutes.  It's a trade off of sound isolation vs breathability.  I'd forgo some of the isolation for less sweaty ear pads.  The base is a huge upgrade from the z300, which has a large dongle.  It allows you to place it wherever, and it looks and works great.  There''s a clear mute indicator (a nice touch) as well as dials for headset and chat volumes, as well as a somewhat difficult to use surround control (still the best of the Turtle Beaches I've used).  The headset itself has a bunch of buttons, in an oddly symmetrical array on both ears.  Once you get used to it, they work better than other TB headsets, and it's easier to adjust sound modes (I never do that anyway).  What I liked most is an upgraded voice indicator system to let you know about pairing, Bluetooth powering on/off, etc...  Plus it pairs much much faster than my z300, XP510, PX51, etc...  The Bluetooth is amazing btw.  Sadly the wireless is only almost as good.  It's static free as always, but like my z300, there are occasional pairing (with base) issues that I never have with the XP/PX series.

Speaking of XP/PX series, like the z300, these are lacking in their versatility.  The base station only takes USB in, which is great for a Mac or PC, but it doesn't take RCA, 3.5mm, or optical.  If these had an analog in (the headset has a 3.5mm in, but that kinda defeats the purpose) as well as an optical in, then these would be the undisputed king of TB headsets.  They're by far the best for Bluetooth and a computer, but they cannot hook up to a receiver, gaming system, optical out from your TV, etc... like the XP/PX series.

To recap:
Amazing presentation/unboxing
Nice look and above average fit/finish (though I'd like to see less plastic for $300)
Phenomenal Bluetooth (audio--I never tried these on a call or Skype)
Great (but not perfect) wireless (no hiss or static, but had a couple pairing issues)
Amazing comfort, save for the sweaty ear pads
Wish the rather nice base station had additional input options

I really wanted to give these 5 stars, and in the end I did albeit with reservations.  The price would be right with a couple changes (or cutting $75 as is).  That being said, I really like these.  The amazing Bluetooth will see these used while traveling, and these give me serenity at my desk, which is kinda priceless. Turtle Beach's best efforts, though they still have room for improvement"

5.0	i was a big R.E. player for a long time then i thought i would try something different and i came across this game i made my decission on buying this after i read the reviews and they didant let me down i just about flew out of my seat when some  thing jumped out and snatched me up! the graphics are great and things are always changing never the same thing! thats what games are missing! BUY this one before you spend your money on number 2 great horror game!
5.0	"This is an awesome game.  It's like Need for Speed: Underground, with some features from Need for Speed: Underground 2.  This graphics are AWESOME!!!! They are just like PS2 graphics and I was amazed when I saw this game.

You choose a car and you can tune it out with visual and preformence upgrades.  You can own up to 20 cars and four bonus cars so there's a lot of cars to choose from.

There are also many new game modes.  All the modes include: Drag, Drift, Street X (off road racing), Circuit, Lap Knockout, Rally Race (race with two different cars), and a mode where you race a random tricked out car.

The last thing to say about this gam,e is the soundtrack, it's AWESOME!!!  They are songs from Need for Speed: Underground 1 and 2 plus new songs.  Some of the artists include: Spiderbait, Skindred, My Chemical Romance, Xzibit, Snoop Dogg and The Doors, Chingy, and a lot more.  There are also some music videos to watch.

This game is a very fun game and a very easy game to learn how to play so I recommend it for new PSP players and racing fans.  This game is a lot of fun but some people might want to rent it before they buy it (gamefly.com *Please Refer Me). Awesome starter game for the PSP"
5.0	"Disregard anything you've read about this console being weaker than the competition.

Don't let quick launch-frame ports running at less than 1080p scare you off.  Microsoft has spent hundreds of millions in R&D on this device and most of it's capabilities have not even been revealed to developers.  First and foremost, there is confidential silicon on the SOC that you can see if you compare the chip from PS4 to XBox One.  It is in this silicon that the Xbox One will absolutely blow away any competition for the next half decade and remain competitive for 5 more years.  Microsoft develops Direct X, a graphics API that developers use for writing 3D games.  The Xbox One supports extensions in hardware for the latest version, DirectX 11.2.  Additionally, the hardware is already in place, but undisclosed to developers for DirectX 11.3, 11.4 & 11.5.  11.1 is available for Windows 8.  DirectX 11.2 is only available for Windows 8.1 and Xbox One.  Exclusively.  DirextX 11.3-11.5 will each ship with the next 3 annual windows 8 releases (Microsoft has planned all the way through Windows 8.4 before moving to Windows 9 in 5 years (8.1-8.4 will all be free updates to 8.0).
As each version is made available, these extensions will be made available to developers on Xbox One. Out the door, the silicon is present to support DX11.2 resources (HARDWARE ACCELERATED!) such as the much talked about ""Tiled Resources"".  This feature alone allows developers to comprise geographically complex scenese that would consume as much as 3 GBs on other systems with as little as 15 MBs.  It also maximizes utilization of CU/Shader Units such that the supposedly ""inferior"" 768 present on Xbox One will, in many cases, blow the doors off of the grossly overestimated 1168 units on the PS4.

Sony has essentially built an off-the-shelf low-mid range computer that will be obsolete in 2-3 years.  Xbox One has been engineered from the ground up to as a true ""NEXT GENERATION"" machine.  Think of the PS4 as a faster version of the PS3, whereas the Xbox One is more of a total reboot of computer graphics technology.  As Microsoft reveals more features to developers, expect games to continue getting better with time.  The much anticipated Halo 5 due out this summer is the first game to really start using the custom silicon.  As such, the game will graphically surpass any game the planet has seen.

Here's one popular developer's take: [...]

Keep in mind, all developers who have been granted access to the updated SDKs and Drivers thus far are under NDA to not disclose the details.  This is a marketing move so that when people see Halo 5 and some yet unannounced titles at E3 in June 2014, they will amaze and delight in a way people haven't seen in a long time.  Additionally, there will be an international install base of 15 million by then, making the economics of exploiting these features viable.

As far as the Xbox One as it is today, it is already an impressive device.  The TV features and voice control are revolutionary.  The ""Snap"" ability is a godsend and the controller (particularly the impulse triggers) is easily the most pleasing controller of any generation.

Buy one, you won't regret it!  Get a PS4 too, if you like Sony's offerings, but don't miss out on what the Xbox One is going to do for Gaming!  Be a part of the most important paradigm shift in gaming. Absolutely Revolutionary"
5.0	Great condition, works great! Five Stars
5.0	Awesome game! Very similar to Far Cry 3 - new locale, animals, vehicles, weapons, etc. Couple of excellent additions to Far Cry 4. Bottom Line =If you liked Far Cry 3, then you will like this game as well. Awesome game!
5.0	Great game very deep for a portaible  title very much like the dirt series so if you enjoy that WRC4 is right up your alley a shame there was no US release
5.0	"Wow! This game is INTENSE! I hear a lot of people comparing it to other games, but what they don't realize is -- Doom was the ORIGINAL of these types of games! Also, people say there's not much storyline to DooM 3.. But there is. You just have to take the time to investigate every little detail, rather than just blaze through the levels. There's so much to the game that you can easily pass by if you get impatient!

You start out arriving on a transport to the Mars Research Facility. When you get off the transport, there's a guy sitting on a bench waiting to leave the planet and return to Earth. If you talk to him, he starts telling you about how he can't wait to leave.. He tells you to watch your back, and trust no one! Once you check in at reception, you are told to report to Marine HQ ASAP, but you don't have to. I spent about 40 minutes wandering around the complex, talking to everyone, watching the news channels, and downloading stuff into my PDA from the information terminals located all over the facility. This is also the perfect time to find the mess hall, and play Super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3 (the arcade terminal is destroyed when the actual game begins, so if you want to play, you need to do it before the hell portal thing is open and everything gets messed up). You can also open and close the window covers in the mess hall, which allows you to check out the scenery outside! As you talk to people, you find out just how screwy things are here -- people hearing voices, some going crazy and biting off their own tongues and carving symbols into their bodies.. Crazy stuff! Once you report to Marine HQ you are sent to find a missing scientist. I'm not going to give away the story, but basically you find him, and all heck breaks loose. Suddenly, zombies and demons are coming at you from every angle, and you are watching your buddies transform into undead!

The DooM 3 environment allows you to interface with many of the computer terminals in the facility! When you walk up to them, your gun lowers and a mouse cursor appears. You can use the terminals to activate bridges, lights, and unlock special doors and what not. Your character is equipped with a PDA -- You can download other peoples' PDAs located on their desks or next to their dead bodies. When you download someone's PDA, you receive all audio and/or video logs they may have produced, as well as any emails they have received. Not only are these quite entertaining to read/listen to, but they can also provide security codes to unlock certain doors or weapons lockers! When you download info from someone's PDA, you also gain their security clearance automatically. Many of the doors throughout the facility scan your PDA to see if you have access to open them.

The weapons are quite similar to the original DooM. You get a chainsaw (if you take the time to download PDAs and get into the storyline, there's actually a funny story behind how they arrived on Mars), pistol, shotgun, machine gun (assault rifle), chaingun, grenades, a plasma gun, a rocket launcher, and, of course, the BFG 9000 (which you can charge up for super blasts!). You also get a soul cube -- an artifact that charges up every time you kill certain monsters. Once the charge is full, you can release it, and it causes instant death to even the most powerful monsters! You are also equipped with a flashlight that acts as a club if you use your attack button. Once all hell breaks loose, you will spend most of your time using the flashlight to find your way around.

Playing this game can almost make you soil yourself at times :) Not only do monsters pop right up in your face, seemingly out of nowhere.. But you also have ""visions"" as you play the game. For example, there's one part where you walk into a bathroom.. And, when you look in the mirror, your vision goes red. You hear the devil laughing, and lots of screaming, and the image of yourself in the mirror explodes! This isn't done in movie format, either, it's done from first person, without a view change. There's also a hallway that is pitch black, and suddenly out of nowhere, all sorts of red-lighted symbols flash down the walls and floor, and a little girl screams out. Lots of random voices and freaky stuff happening throughout the whole game!!!!!! Never a dull moment. Just when you think things have calmed down and you start to relax, BAM something happens!

Not only is the environment setup in this game !!!AWESOME!!!, but the graphics themselves are freakin cool as well! You had better have a good machine if you want to get the full effect. I am running a Pentium IV 2.8ghz 800mhz fsb processor with 1 gig of dual channel DDR400 and a 256 meg GeForce 5700 graphics card on a 21 inch monitor. (Running XP) With this setup, I can play in 1024x768 graphics mode w/ ultra detail, and I only get a little bit of lag when I'm in the middle of a HUGE firefight. If I go any higher than 1024x768, the game is impossible to play because of performance problems.

The downsides to this game are:

a) No in-game music. I miss the awesome guitar riffs that really added to the environment of DooM and DooM 2.

b) The levels are so dark, you spend most of your time using the flashlight -- sometimes you even have to switch back and forth between it and your weapon in the middle of a firefight, just so you can tell what you're shooting at!

c) Multiplayer does not work at 56k.

d) Multiplayer does not have a co-op mode.

e) It's a super resource hog, but the resources it uses up, it does put to good use!

I've been playing for about three hours a day for a week, and I still don't think I'm anywhere near the end. The game just keeps getting better, and they keep introducing new features and monsters!

I would reccommend that you buy this game, and buy it now! To take advantage of it to its full effect, play it at night with no lights on, in complete silence except for the game itself. (turn off any air conditioners or any other background noise) The sound is awesome, especially with 5.1 and a good subwoofer! Unless you are one of those types that seeks out fault in anything and everything, you will NOT be disappointed with this game, IN THE SLIGHTEST! ID Strikes Back"

The G910 is a little big, but it is VERY responsive. I use the macros for windows shortcuts, as well as in game macros. Well made, responsive, and cool!"

5.0	This game is a blast to play.  Highly recommended. Very fun game.
5.0	i played this game from beginning to end in one sitting.  16 hours straight.  it's pitch perfect.  great learning curve and satisfying combat where button mashing will get you nowhere.  for the first time in a long time, i was able to just sit down and complete a game all the way through without having to look on the net for a hint or walkthrough.  it isn't easy, but it's not ridiculous either.  way to go Creative Assembly.  more like this, please. what a great game
5.0	Nice  game Five Stars
5.0	The shipment was fast, I have been playing sims since the first sim city for windows in the 90s and I just love all the new things this Expansion comes with. I would recommend it for any sim lover oh and it ups your house hold from 6 to 10 as the max Can't stop playing
5.0	"I purchased this game based on reviews that said it was good.  I was not disappointed.  Having recently finished GTAV and State of Decay, I couldn't help but draw comparisons about the open world combined with the zombie survival aspects of the game.  The game is great.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun the game is.

Finally, we have a game that takes the usually serious topic of zombies and doesn't take itself seriously.  I laughed out loud many times while playing it.  For example, you can put on ANY clothing item you find (male or female).  Or, as you learn to craft better zombie-killing weapons, you start to build things that are just ludicrous - early on I taped a rotary saw to a sledge hammer (makes sense), later I added a gem to a flashlight to make a lightsaber (doesn't make sense, but AWESOME).

Unlike most open world games, there is a story-based time limit that is always hanging over you (it is plenty of time, but you feel pressured the whole game to keep moving).  I like the feel it creates - IF there ever was a zombie apocalypse, you would want to keep moving, and the game simulates that feeling.

The story of the game was actually deeper than I thought it would be.  This is my first Dead Rising game, and there were plot points that drew on previous games, but I never felt lost and I quickly was caught up to understand what was going on.

The graphics showcase what the Xbox One is capable of.  Textures look great.  Furthermore, with the next gen hardware, they are able to put HUNDREDS of zombies on the screen at the same time without the system slowing down.  It looks great, and the sheer number of zombies is incredible (and you'll end up killing thousands of them before the game is over).

Overall, this is a great game.  Lots of fun, deep play mechanics (some people say it gets a little repetitive due to excessive zombie fighting, and it can if you want to kill EVERY zombie, but the game clearly seems to say that there are times to fight and times to run).  I highly recommend this game, you won't be disappointed. best xbox one exclusive so far"
5.0	"I just want to start out by saying that I am not a fanboy of this game by any means, I didn't even buy the game right on release day I bought it about 4 days later,  and to make a long story short I just want to say this game is phenomenal to say the least, its got its mine things that could use improvements but in general just an amazing game.
The graphics are simply the best to date, followed by swtor. The areas remind me of wow on steroids.
The sound draws you into the game, it is great, it flows with combat and none combat
Lots of races and classes make it for a great diverse game
The buttons kinda threw me off at first, infact I didn't like them at all when I first started playing cause it wasn't the normal tab or click on something and kill it, but once you get used to the buttons it really is the best controls in a MMO that has ever come to be.  You still use WASD but with a targeting system, it sounds odd but in honesty it really is the best system, I still play wow and swtor and I have played almost every other MMO out there, and this game surpasses them all, wow is very polished cause it has had 8 years to become polished.
The quests are standard quest and story line is standard as well, nothing in horrid depth, but im not much for stories either way, im more about gameplay.
Will this kill wow, who knows I don't think wow will ever go down because everyone is so comfortable with wow and everyone can run wow smoothly on there 4+ year old computers.  This game has amazing graphics and even runs on average pc's and still looks amazing.  One awesome feature is the actual Looking for group button and ports you right in the instances and raids and ports you right out.  Believe it or not lots of big games don't have  a LFG button, like swtor.
To make this short, the game is worth playing and it will consume you.  It is a fantastic game and I see many good things happening for this game. Fantastic New MMO"

5.0	Good buy Good buy
5.0	I have played each and everyone of these games and my personal favorite is brawl. But that is now. Back then it was melee. The graphics are almost the same on charecters like kirby, pokemon, and charecters like that as brawls graphics. The story mode is pretty good too. Though it is not as long or hard it still is pretty good. Brawl has many more things to do but the melee game has a better battle for multiplayer. The melee i like the music better because they are the original soundtracks from the actual games. Melee is also one of the oldest games for the GC and it has some of the best graphics of all of the GC games. Man, does this game bring back many good memories! There is other things to do on this game becides battle and story mode. I really love the story modes on these games. This is probably my favorite GC games and i still love to play it. Good game for its time
5.0	"AMAZING!!!
Mafia is probably one of the most revolutionary games of this genre. Mafia is a 3rd person adventure game, which takes place in the 30s. You are a taxi driver, and save a few under atack mafia members and then accept a job opening from the don of the mafia.
The story line in this game, is, well, extremely good! After you are in the mafia, you raise from the ranks to become a feared mafia leader. You start up driving people and, once you go high enough up the ranks, you start stealing cars, eliminating enemy mafias, blowing up cars, and kill gang members.
There is a cinematic in the beginning and end of EVERY mission. These cinematics describe the story line that is not shown during gameplay, such as the private lives of the main characters, feelings they have, and the such.
The graphics in this game are unbelievable! The game takes on an advanced graphics engine, the freedom to go everywhere and do whatever you want, and even generate random scenes of theft, robbery, and destruction within the world of the character. This brings me to my first downside to the game. BECAUSE the graphics are so good, and BECAUSE the world is so interactive, this game requires a heavy PC. The game recommends 733mhz CPU and 32mb video card, 256mb of ram. I have an 1.1ghz athlon, radeon 8500 64mb, and 256 sdram, and it barely cuts it. I am running at 800X600 and it skips, begins to be choppy, and will even just pause for a matter of minutes until the game revives again. Make sure you have the rig to run the game!
The sounds are INCREDIBLE as well. Not so much the sound effects, but the music is excellent. The music wants to keep you going, and makes missions more exciting. For example, the mission I am currently on requires you to run away from the police in a banged-up car. It has swift and fast music, with very high notes, to show danger and excitement. There are some strange transisions from song to song, but besides that, the music and the sound effects are excellent.
The replay value is nice, but then again, there are no alternative endings or paths to take.
Another problem is that the game is DIFFICULT. You should expect to be on this game for a long time, for this game has one of the most respectively long and detailed single player games ever, and the missions are hard, and require skill, thinking, and trying over and over again!
There will be a patch for multiplayer soon, and that should bring excitement as well! There will be deathmatch, capture the flag, and all sorts of unique games like racing, and other games requiring cars. Expect to see many families (aka CLANS) against one another, and to see real virtual mafia action just like the 30s!
This game looks promising. Not only for the single player game, but also the multiplayer addon, and the other great mods and single player addons that will be graced infront of Mafia's shoes. Expect to be playing this game into 2006! One word...."
5.0	"I was pleasantly surprised to find a lot of my favorite songs and artists on this game. Parts of it satisfied the 90s-child in me, while others were hard rock classics. The songs are varied but are for the most part a grunge/heavy metal/hard rock theme.

This game is perfect for anyone who loves karaoke. This game in particular has lots of high-energy songs and involves more shouting than crooning, making it ideal for parties. I definitely will look further into the SingStar francise. All my favorite songs!"

5.0	"I am a fan of Insomniac studio (the same people who created Resistance series on PS3) so even though I couldn't get into this game by watching its trailers, I had to give it a try. I have to say it was nothing like I was expecting and it blew my mind.

****************************************************************************PROS*******************************************************************************
Stylish and fluid gameplay: This is the biggest strength of this game. While difficult at first, I loved the fluid movements you can do in the game. Jump, wall runs and air dash reminded me of Devil may cry. Loved going from one end of the city to another defeating enemies using variety of fun weapons and pulling stylish acrobatic moves.

Fun and colorful weapons: Really loved them. In the beginning you start out with some ok weapons but as you progress through the game you get some really awesome devastating yet funny weapons. Exploding teddy, firecracker gun, hairspray gun etc. are all fun to use to defeat different enemies and the explosion/impact they produce is quite enjoyable.

Variety of enemies and bosses: When I saw the trailer I was worried that I may be just fighting mutants but once you start progressing through the game, you get to face different types of mutants, robots as well as human enemies. It was quite fun using variety of weapons on them. Really enjoyed some of the bosses like frisco bots.

Humorous missions: All and I mean all of the missions in this game are extremely funny. There were times some jokes made me laugh so much that I had to pause the game. Bravo to the creators!

Beautiful open world: Found it quite fun to traverse through the open world of this game. Even when on the missions sometime I would just wonder off as some parts of the town would look quite appealing. Loved jumping to the top of the tall building, surfing on the bodies of water, grinding on the bridge and fighting different enemies in the carnival settings.

Upgrades, perks and collectibles: As if main and side missions were not enough, this game has tons and tons of collectibles that helps you obtain different upgrades and perks.

Online play: Yup in addition to 60+ hrs of missions and side missions there is online play that will unlock more unique weapons.

Replayability; All the missions and side missions are replayable. Loved replaying many of them especially excalimune sword mission. Really fun.

Learning curve: This game can be difficult at first as controls are a bit novel. But once you get used to them, the game becomes quite fun.

Truly hope they make a sequel. I really enjoyed this game. The gameplay was solid and the story was as humorous as I have ever experienced in a video game. I hope I get to experience more in the future. I wouldn't give many games 10/10 but a perfect score for this one. Well done Insomniac. A humorous fun game"

5.0	"The wife had been wanting her own controller, and had expressed interest in this particular one numerous times while out shopping. Every time we saw it out it was $54.99, and it was this price on here for a while. When I saw that it was on sale for $42.99 on here, i decided to go ahead and order it.

As always it came in a timely manner, and the packaging was in great shape. As far as the controller, she loves it and it works, which we knew it most likely would as these controllers have been out for awhile. Very pleased with this transaction and the product we received.

5.0	"Most of the reviews on here are people complaining that their download didn't finish properly. Download errors happen, redownload it and move on with your life. I thought I'd write a review that was actually about the game.

Battlefield Bad Company 2 is one of my favorite games. This game has an extremely comprehensive weapon selection from the classics like the Thompson and 1911 to modern death machines like the 249 SAW and FN F2000. The vehicle controls are spot on and player control is the best it's ever been in a Battlefield game. The game has been well supported by the development team with plenty of extra maps and content added to the game after release. There are not many active bugs left in this software and I don't see much cheating in the online multiplayer. As far as a battlefield game goes, this is as good as it gets. We'll see if DICE can up the ante with Battlefield 3 this winter, but until then this is where you need to be. Epic Battles"
5.0	Gosh, this game is hard Help me. . .
5.0	I bought this game for my 11 y.o. son.  He is enjoying it a lot.  He has other hockey games but this game is different and so he is finding it more interesting.  The various location options, including a pond rink, are a bonus.  Also, he is really enjoying the ability to be the goal tender in the game.  He has actually played the position as a squirt and since then, has asked to play it full time.  We opted not to go that way so, the game is filling in, sort of.  Overall, the variety of options make this game lots of fun and even my other son who doesn't normally like hockey games, is enjoying it too. Hockey Highlight
5.0	virtual cruising.  Worked great Five Stars
5.0	Very affordable. cool looking once your apply to your controller. Would recommend to anyone looking to spruce their system up. Controller skin
5.0	"Pocket Fighter no doubt should be considered ""childish"" This game packs them all as with all the other Street Fighter games. The cuteness of the characters actually throw me off and I lose each time, watching it while you play is much fun. I wonder if there is a Japanimation for this game.

I love this game, it reminds me of that game called Vampire Stalkers where you have all hte fighting attributes and super combos with a wacky extra punch and kick using animals and objects. In this game they use a donkey, and a hammer, and other weird things to defeat your enemy, and like in MARVEL SUPER HEROES where you collect gems to power up, the same rule applies here as well on this game. Each time you hit your opponent gems come out and other treasures that  you must collect, but watch out not to get punched or kicked while your trying to grab the gems..

Awesome game and a collectible, don't ever sell this game, it will become a valuable collectible, and the cost value will increase. They may be shorter, but they still kick Tookus just the same!"
5.0	"Like many sequals it's hard to live up to a powerful legacy, but Konami has found a winning formula for their Castlevania series.  Symphony of the Night (SOTN) was an awsome PS1 game, mixing incredible RPG elements with classic Castlevania style.  Plus the difficulty was at a medium to where any one could play it.  Than came Circle of the Moon (COTM) which had the same style (and did a good job at that) but was flawd at that it was way to difficult.  More often than not you would find yourself killed by a sekeleton or a slime.  Now we have Harmony of Dissonance and it is just as great, but it is way to easy.  How, I beat it in less than 2 days.  Virtually unacceptable.
The story of HOD is that Juste Belmont finds his friend MAxim injured after being gone for training for many years.  Juste is the Grandson of Simon BElmont star of Castlevnaia 1, 2, and 4.  Juste also finds out that his and Maxims lady friend Lydie has been captured.  So they venture into Draculas Castel to rescue her.
The style is the same as SOTN or COTM so for those who played the 2 will get the hang of it quickly.  However the new change is that you now have spell books that modify the sub weapons and thus virtualy eliminates hearts and focu on MP.  I wll say that the best combo (and your invincible while doing this) is the Knife and Wind book.
Overall this is a fun game, will include some additional hours plus you also have the Boss Rush Mode, SOund test, and play as Maxim to keep you busy after you win.  SO this is a must buy, but like I said, a little easy. Better than COTM and almosr equal to SOTN"
5.0	Must play for any and all! Awesome story and art style. If you're a trophy hunter it's an easy platinum too. Amazing game.
5.0	It was fast shipping and in great condition when it got here.  Very easy to hook up and looks like fun to use. This was a very good gift for my husband.
5.0	"Day 1

Like the title says it's a two sided mouse pad. It's quite big. For reverence, if you were to close a 15 inch laptop and place this mousepad on top of it, the mousepad would nearly cover it. It's made out of a single metal sheet so it's hard to bend. It has rubber feet to prevent it from moving as well. Both sides don't feel too different, but the difference is somewhat noticeable. It's a mousepad with two sides. What more can you need?"

5.0	"This game has everything you could want from an action movie.
Story aside (because the story isn't great), as a sandbox game this is incredible. The visuals are top notch.
I still can't believe this game came out more than 6 years ago. One of my favorite games of all time"
5.0	"I was an avid, to say the least, player of Halo 3. I played over 8,000 matches & something like 2,000 hours. Absolutely loved 3 & when Reach came out, was very excited. However, Reach was an absolute disappointment for me. Now that's all I'll say about the previous games, this was just to give you an idea of where I stand with the Halo's. As for Halo 4.. this game is GREAT. It feels like a combination of the best parts of 3 & Reach without the Reach trash. I mean c'mon, the BR's back BUT they kept the DMR.. take your pick or pack both!! Even with the armor abilities, it feels more like 3 than it does Reach though, soooo If you were into Reach more than 3.. that could be a problem for you. The customization for armor & load outs is what I've always wanted & what Reach attempted but didn't get quite right. Now, a lot of people complain that the sprint & loadouts are too much like Call Of Duty & I say.. And?? Since when was that a bad thing? CoDs customization is probably the best thing about their games & to integrate that into Halo properly is genius! 343 really did a great job of putting their own little stamp on the Halo series & without removing all that Bungie did, even building on it. Very respectful, very awesome. The campaign is the best one yet, super character & story driven more than ever, AND IT PAYS OFF. Beautiful game, the sound, the graphics.. the everything. A ton of fun, with a little familiarity & some new & welcome additions. An obsessed Halo 3 fan is very satisfied, that should say enough.

5.0	"In this game you can imagine being a doctor. You play as the role of a new doctor in town named Abby.

In the game you get to do things that real doctors do such as: giving checkups, getting the height and weight of patients, taking temperatures, taking blood pressure and pulse, doing eye exams, analyzing coughs, doing x-rays, removing splinters, comparing different marks such as (bruises, scratches, spots, etc), and doing allegry tests.

I think this game is fun and interesting.

I would recommend it to people who are doctors, want to become doctors, or if they like the imagine game series(like I do. Imagine Family Doctor"

From Nintendo 64 Emulation with 4 Players on Mario Kart 64 in HD via Project 64, to 4 Player castle crashersd and everyother game on steam I have gotten well worth my money into this adapter!

5.0	This is a great easy to install, clip & play hardware with lenses that trick the Kinect sensor and lets u play in a small living room. Great Product if u have less space in your living room
5.0	Ultimately this thing failed me, but not for the reasons you might expect. My PS4 was constantly overheating and so I ordered this as one last ditch effort to fix it. I'd tried everything and so I was hopeful that this might do it. Nope. That said, this is a great item for my new refurbished PS4. It keeps the fan from ever really kicking into high gear. I do wish the blue LED wasn't so bright, but it's easy to unplug it when I go to bed. The joystick covers that this came with aren't great but I mainly considered them a little freebie with the stand. I really like the charging feature and how it turns one USB into 3. It's worth the price just for that. Even though it didn't solve the problem I hoped it would, it's still a great stand if you're looking for a vertical charging stand or just a way to get more USB ports. Excellent little stand
5.0	Good game Good game
5.0	"My 17 year old attached it in less then 15 minutes.

5.0	"For a headset designed for the PS3, it's a total win. But for the PCs, while most of the feaures are exclusive to the PS3, it serves you well as your headset. But obviously you'll want this to work for your games with no hassles, and without bothering other people as well... I'm telling you my experiences so far (as there's a new firmware that expanded its features more).

Short version: It sounds great! Long version: You won't believe the quality of the sound through your ears. It's crystal clear and ramps up with the virtual surround for your games. For movies so far, it only worked on stereo, but does that detract you from enjoying a good sound like this brings? Absolutely not.

The only time you pulg this headset is to recharge its battery. And i warn you, it doesn't have to be necessarily on the PS3, as it USB powered. You can recharge it on the console, PC or an adaptor that goes to an AC power supply (as I have one fortunately). But for 2 hours + of charge, you have more than 8 to enjoy.

Obviously, somehow I don't notice since I got lost in time when playing or watching a movie.

And for the few times I played online, the mic works just fine. Now one thing I have noticed is the feedback when playing in single player. I mean, why bother having that on solo when you just need it to go online? That's the only catch.

While some of you want to find a headset with a push on the bass to enjoy, it doesn't mean the this product doesn't deserve any recognition. It's a true headset that gets you in the game... without bothering people.

A sure buy, especially for those who knew about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/another-version-of-this-headset/dp/B0087OZ5FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">another version of this headset</a>, but don't have the money to afford it.

P.S.: I'll write again when I test the virtual surround on a BD movie, as a new firmware was launched today (v4.20). You know you're gonna love it!"

5.0	"Wowsers is this game phenomenal. The variety of weaponry, the challenges of the missions, the amazing graphics, the online multi-player capability....I've run through the single player version 4 times, and am an online addict. It's insane. It's gorgeous. I love it.
Admittedly, the missions are occasionally repetitive, but there are enough changes to keep things interesting. Running through the single player version multiple times is still very enjoyable, because one may choose different weapons, augmentations, and answers to questions from non-player characters.
The main problem comes from the insanely fast passage of time which occurs whilst playing - I swear my computer desk zaps into some bizarro space/time continuum thing which makes 6 hours seem like 1. Oy.
My advice - if you have a significant other with whom you wish to spend time, just stay right the heck away from this game. Seriously, oh my yes. Otherwise, run (do not walk) and get this game. You truly won't be sorry. Oooooohhhh give me my life back...."

5.0	Like the title puts it, this game is a wowser. Few games have ever compelled me to not do anything (and I mean anything) for the whole day but play on continuously. Arkham Asylum is worth its price (on second thoughts, even more than that) and is as good as its ratings come. No problem anyhow with the game. Everything went smoothly. Right now,I'm just biding time for a second shot at this game. What an awesome game!

5.0	good story line, really liked it. great online play i would recommend this like
5.0	This game has truly photo-realistic graphics and additionally, the replays of the areas are incredible.  The game even permits one to save replays.  The cars in this game are absolutely incredible, and unlike other games, you are not limited to some specific models with similar designs.  Additionally, the selection of cars is absolutely phenomenol.  My best cars for this game are the Jaguar XJ220, the GT-ONE Road Car, the infamous rally car Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version and the Corvette C-5R.  My favorite car, however, has to be the 2000 Beetle Cup, but the handling is clumsy and sometimes forced, like a Beetle.  The scenery is incredible!  I absolutely love the Tokyo tracks and the Rome track for the views of the city.  I additionally love the rally tracks around Tahiti and the wet tracks of Tokyo.  The last note for this game is the game becomes very difficult on the Professional Level.  For example, on the Red Emblem level, you are forced to drive a ROAD car, and you are forced to compete against six other RACE cars (in other words, much better and faster cars than yours). One of the major disappointments for this game is that there is no crash damage, like NASCAR Thunder, Sprint Cars: World of Outlaws or the incoming Pro Race Driver.  The second and last disappointment is that in mutiplayer, especially two-player, one doesn't face computer cars as well, as in NASCAR Thunder.  However, Codemasters' Pro Race Driver may resolve that issue.  Other than that, buy this game if you are a racing freak or just a freak! Hot game, Must-buy!
5.0	I think it works great. Gives extra punch to the pedal. It feels much more reinforced. Now I'm not afraid of breaking it if anyone stomps too hard. I had a little trouble threading the screws because they kept going crooked, but I got them on track by pushing harder on the screwdriver. No need to remove the pedal from its base...I just held the pedal closed and screwed them in. It's good
5.0	this game is fun i barley finished the first mass effect the story its so crazy i think it a story you need to play i want to play on insane :D good game
5.0	It is one of the few old games that I still play.  Story line is incredibly good, the setting of the post nuclear war of drugs, radiation, adrenaline and max. pessimism of the post-nuclear world is incredible.  You will be a vault dweller while playing the game, unifying with the character you created.  I like fallout's graphic engine, still today, isometric and nice graphics.  The only problem is the saving times but it won't cause that much trouble.  If they release a Fallout 3, with the same sounds and graphics but with a better story line, i still buy it and rate it 5.  One of the few RPGs of the past that we literally felt free to do anything.  Play it, finish it and buy the Fallout 2 also. Post-nuclear Experience
5.0	"a great buy, very fun to play and now watch movies with xbox live and netflix.

5.0	My friend recommended that I purchase this game and when I saw that it was only 10 dollars I though the game must be bad but how I was wrong this game is amazing Im not to keen on multiplayer games but this one is just to amazing and for 10 dollars you will be dumb enough not to buy it You cant beat this
5.0	Okay so it isn't going to win any realism awards but I'm having a blast playing this game.  Some of the planes suck, but some are just so fun!  Very diverse set of missions and objectives that kept me very entertained.  I especially loved supporting the D-Day invasion and the liberation of Paris.  Flying in this game is as satisfying a feeling as any flight sim I've ever played and more than most.  Maybe when it was 60 dollars I would have given it 4 stars but I still think it would have been very much worth it, but at 20 dollars it's a no brainer.  If you are interested in WW2 and aren't too much of a stickler for realism do yourself a favor and buy this game. So much fun, thank you Ubisoft!
5.0	I think this is the last DDR game I truly enjoyed. I hate the Supernova games and the things like the Disney versions and stuff like that. This has a nice mixture of American pop songs, Eurobeat and original DDR tracks! I definitely recommend it! Great Game

The best thing about it is that the mouse vibrates when you fire, so it feels like you are holding the weapon as it fires. Also the directional pad that goes in your left hand is very small and fits comfortably. It is much better than trying to hold a large PC keyboard and mouse on your lap. Works perfectly, no slowdown, no lag"

Awesome console tool, decent screwdrivers
5.0	"It's kind of difficult to be a gamer in the next-gen era since there's just so many games that it is kind of difficult to invest the kind of hours a game requires since there is so many games that interest you and with work, school etc taking up time as well, it can be tricky trying to play everything that comes down the pipe. Strange as it is, I haven't played much DS games but not for lack of games but just lack of funds. I thought I'd give The World Ends With You a shot and while I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite games on the DS, it's sure quite fun to play anyway.

Story: You play as Neku, a kid who is more comfortable being by himself and doesn't want to rely on anyone (a kid after my own heart, it seems). He awakens in the Shibuya District in Tokyo with amnesia and no clue of how we arrived. Soon, he receives a message to be somewhere in 60 minutes or face erasure. With the ability to read minds and teaming up with a young girl, Shiki, Neku has to complete various tasks and take on numerous creatures lest he face being erased.

Graphics: The game's graphics go for more a presentation rather than really going all-out in terms of the visuals. With character designs from Tetsuya Nomura who worked on various Final Fantasy games and the movie, the game takes on a comic-book feel mixed with 2D graphics to create the world which is quite inviting and certainly never boring.

Sound/Music: The voice acting is kind of scattered with voice clips and sentences now and then as well as the occasional ""huh?"" when a character's confused or surprised. It works well within the game though too bad it wasn't voice acting the entire game. As for the music, it's a good mix of J-Pop and Rock and even though I wouldn't really call it a buy or even download-worthy but it works quite well and I never felt like I had to put on my own music.

Gameplay: Most DS games use either screen as a map or extra gameplay features such as accessing special attacks or character stats. This game however requires both to fight as Neku and his partner have to battle the creatures on both screens in a sort-of tag team as Neku battles with the stylus on the bottom while the partner takes on the same enemy with the D-Pad or the face buttons on the top. Beat an enemy on one screen and it disappears from both screen so coordination and combos are extremely helpful. In fact they're kind of a necessity since successful attacks will pass a ""puck"" to the other player and keep it going long enough and better attacks will form. I will admit at first it was hard to keep track of both screens but while I still got hit quite a bit, I became a lot better and with the game's adjustable difficulty menu (the ""harder"" you make it, the better items and EXP you get) so it's best to start slow.

Neku uses attacks based on ""pins"" which are basically equippable moves that can level up the more you use them. One requires a vertical slash with the stylus to cut enemies while another can allow you to nab cars and other objects and fling them at enemies. Tap repeatedly for bullets, drag to create a fire trail or slash vertically to create ice columns are just some of the special attacks that you can utilize. If you don't have a screen protector yet, buy one since the action can get quite scratch-heavy and a protector will help. Another is that it's very easy to miss your enemy and with a usage timer that has to recharge before you can use it again, you'll probably rely on a certain set of pins for best in battle.

Other things can be used such as shops where you can buy clothing and wearing certain clothing in certain areas will give you bonuses since you're more ""with it"". It is isn't like say San Andreas where you can make your guy super muscular or ridiculously fat but it gives more options for strategy and gameplay changes. Other things like eating food which takes time to digest which will also give you stats help with playing the game and the customizing and new game+ features help the game feel more fresh the more you play. A word of caution though: this game can easily kick your *** if you're not careful and I often found myself being attacked from all sides on both screens because my eyes or fingers weren't fast enough but not to dissuade gamers from picking it up since it is fun and certainly different than ""press X"" gameplay but it took some getting used to.

There's games that are a bit more niche audience and more for a certain kind of gamer but I'd say everyone needs to at least play The World Ends With You at least once. Not just for the uniqueness of it but the possibility after all the weirdness that you just might end up loving it. A unique game on a unique system"
5.0	I really wanted to enjoy this game. It was entertaining for the first hour then it just got old. Bad draw distance and frustrating controls. Extremely repetitive. Disappointed
5.0	I bought this for my 11 year old for Christmas. It is a fun game for just about anyone. There is a storyline and with that, there are obstacles or puzzles to think through. If you figure it out, you advance in the game. My daughter loved it and then she passed it on to her older brother who also loved it. Fun!
5.0	"Does it look as good as the 2012 E3 reveal? No.

Is it a revolution in the game industry? No.

Does it have enough new features to keep you interested after the ceaseless tirade of open-world games? Yes.

Watch Dogs is a bit of a dichotomy as it seems like they were going for a very near-future take on urban crime and hacking with a dark tone and a hint of cyberpunk themes. This is evident in the aesthetic, the mood at times, the music, and in a few of the missions. It feels incredible in its shining moments where you're chasing down a criminal on foot in the rainy streets of Chicago by nightfall, only to pull out your gun and take a few shots, hurdle over a fence, then trigger a transformer to blow remotely with your cellphone.

In moments like these I feel like the game has a feel unique to its own and is incredibly satisfying to play. Unfortunately it seems like some executives got the memo on how immensely popular (and lucrative) Grand Theft Auto V was and you can see the GTA influence creep up in the free roam gameplay (outside of main missions). This I feel is the weakest part of the game, and although you still have your hacker tricks and cellphone profiling intact, it feels like an imitation rather than an innovation.

I for one, having played Grand Theft Auto games since the 90s have grown tired of their formula of sandbox drive-and-shoot gameplay in a lifeless closed-door city. Watch Dogs threatens to change all of that with randomly-generated personalities and background details in Chicago's denizens. Sometimes with superficial details like ""Has an expired gym membership"", to more pertinent details like ""Painkiller addict"". Follow that suspicious person around and he might try to mug or attack someone, giving way to a confrontation or chase. This sort of techno-vigilante feel is amazing, and it's too bad the tropes of the genre seem to water it down. Perhaps the hacker aesthetic is dulled when you're simply walking the streets in daylight and nothing is happening, nevertheless there is fun to be had here - in many, many places, missions and collectibles.

The online play is equally exciting, with the 1 vs. 1 hide-and-seek hacker encounters stealing the show. At almost any time you may be invaded by another player trying to tail you or hack your phone for data/reputation. If you're the victim, you have to scan the crowds and utilize cameras and other methods to spot the intruder. If you're the attacker, you have to blend in, sticking to the shadows or being inconspicuous while the timer ticks to completion. These can be intense moments and when you spot your man and take him down or get away with your digital heist, it can be incredibly rewarding.

Overall, I am slightly disappointed with the final direction of on the game, but after a two-year wait and delays, graphical downgrades and bad press, I have to say: This is a good game and with a unique playstyle that is enough to keep even an oversaturated open-world game player like me interested. Open-world urban action game for those tired of Grand Theft Auto."
5.0	Bought this mouse back in 2014 and it lasted 2 years before the contact started getting really dirty to start wearing down. For a 40 dollar mouse I think 2 years is about appropriate. Will be buying this mouse again because I cannot live without all the buttons for work/mmo games/music. Lasted 2 Years, Buying Again
5.0	This game is much more alive and exciting than the first Assassin's Creed (and that was already a pretty good game). The scenery, the cities you visit, the stealth game play, AC 2 is fantastic. The story line in this game is also much more exciting. Ezio, the main character, is more real and easy to like. I very much recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of AC, stealth games, or action games. An Enthralling Sequel
5.0	Quality item, quick service. Five Stars
5.0	Holds a great charge, I was surprised! Usually after market batteries (not necessarily from KMD) don't last very long (I've been through several PSP batteries that die after only 2-3 hours when my old worn-out Sony original lasts 4-5). This KMD battery has lasted 8.5 hours on my AGS-001 and is still going on the first charge! I'm highly impressed and will be buying their DS Lite version. This battery has breathed new life into one of my favorite portable systems. I don't know how long it'll last on the AGS-101 but if it lasts this long with the front light I imagine the backlit version will last a great amount of time as well. The perfect OEM replacement
5.0	pretty good game and was in good cond. Five Stars
5.0	"it is easy to install (as all logitech products!) the layout is beautiful, it is not too wide (the old G15 wouldn't fit my desk).
The macro keys are easy to program and great to use!
The backlight is a must have if you play FPS games!
The LCD is much more useful than I expected! I played NWN2 and the character's stats are all printed there, saving me the trouble of pressing C and having half of my screen filled with information just because I wanted to check my hitpoints. I love this keyboard!"
5.0	"It actually took me a while to warm up to this game.  Not being an RPG nut, I didn't like the combat model at first, wanting a more hack 'n slash style.  It did grow on me, however, as did the game as a whole.  It is in many ways better than the last couple movies!
Strengths: Awesome story; the acting is better than Episode I and II by far; some really cool looking worlds; deep combat model (does take some getting used to); characters feel varied and different.  The main characters have more depth than Anakin and Padme!  The light/dark paths are a cool idea, and the various solutions to problems a welcome twist.  Also good animations and sound.
Weaknesses: Too linear.  I was spoiled by Morrowind's immense size and sense of ""go anywhere"" freedom.  The worlds of KOTOR aren't as big, and there's no fun/point in just exploring like in Morrowind.  Pretty much all NPC's point you towards the main quest.  Also, I didn't feel that the light/dark affiliation made THAT much of a difference.  It stinks that you can't keep playing when you beat the game, because only at the end are you really able to see any improvement/change, and then the game ends.  The graphics are good, but the face models are weak and repetitive.  Also, the game may scare off rookies with its complex D&D rules (+3 modifiers, saving rolls, etc), although it's possible to just ignore them.  Also, there are too many similar weapons; the 895 different kinds of blasters don't really seem to make much of a difference in actual combat.
Overall, this is an addictive game; I wish there was more to do than the main quest (there are a few dozen side quests, but once you leave a world you may not be able to come back), because I wanted to keep fine-tuning my character. Best Star Wars Game"
5.0	My old one broke, and I have purchased other third party AV cables that came with issues. This one is flawless, it works perfectly. This is awesome
5.0	Item was very clean and showed minimal to almost no signs of use. Good condition! Good condition!
5.0	"This is a great game, though definitely a departure from previous titles in the series.  I enjoyed it, but it's interesting how much they changed up the formula.  I really love how they simplified the format of the HMs and show you which moves are super effective.  I'm sure the hardcore don't need this, but if you're a casual like me or using a dual-element attack against a dual-element Pokemon this is a real life-saver.

Also, I love how they removed the Pokemon Ami games in this version, I spent way too much time farming cupcakes in Gen 6.  :) Great Pokemon Game"
5.0	Best played in VR. Five Stars
5.0	This game offers free to play or a sub, this card makes it easy as it allows you to bypass the auto renewal so if you ever get bored you can just live and forget without the added chore of having to convince the website shes just not right for you. 10/10. What would you do with 60 days of paradise?

5.0	"I felt like I was really there living the game with the characters. The AI is memorable,and the voiceacting is top notch. I still go back and play this game often even after all the years that I have had it. Part II is even better with more toys and weapons to play with.

Great Game! Great game"
5.0	"It's actually been ages since I first acquired this game, but for some reason I'm only just now getting around to reviewing it.  When I first heard about this game my initial reaction was Disney and Final Fantasy together?!  This is going to be complete crap!  However, because I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy, I just couldn't resist buying this game and trying it out.  I just had to see for myself what all the fuss was about...

Graphics (score 10/10): The graphics are excellent.  They're sort of cartoony in that everything is rounded and sort of exaggerated in proportions, but that's appropriate since most of the game involves Disney characters, which ARE cartoons.  Anyway, the art style aside, the graphics look very good.  Everything is crisp and detailed and lovely.  The only thing one might complain about is the fact that Final Fantasy characters are altered from their original art styles to fit in better with the more cartoony look of the game.  I didn't hold this against the game though since they would've stuck out like a sore thumb otherwise.

Music (score 10/10): Whether or not you enjoy the music will depend almost entirely on whether or not you liked the original film scores for several Disney movies since a lot of the music for each area is based on those songs.  I'm not a huge fan of the Disney songs, but I enjoyed them just fine.  What is unequivocally awesome, though, are the original songs.  I love the intro. song, the music in Hollow Bastien, and the music during the final boss fight.  The voice acting is very top notch as well, so this section of the review gets a perfect 10/10 score from me.

Characters (score 10/10): The main characters are pretty likable.  Sora is a bit simple-minded, but he's also fairly young (I'm not sure exactly how young), so that's understandable.  Riku really shines as a complex and interesting character who's vacillating between his friends and joining the ""dark side"", so to speak.  In fact, I found him more interesting as a quasi-villain than Ansem - the actual main villain.  Now let's talk about the side characters.  For the most part, this game is more about the Disney characters and the original characters (like Sora, Riku, Kairi, Ansem, etc.) than it is about the Final Fantasy characters.  While entire game worlds are built around the Disney characters, the Final Fantasy characters are more like cameos that pop up here and there.  Their backstories are often altered to fit in with the plot of the game (which makes perfect sense), but their core personalities remain intact and accurate.  So, despite their essentially ancillary roles, I was quite happy with all the fanservice anyway!

Story (score 10/10): Well, how to sum up the story?  Um, there are these things called ""hearts"" which seem to be like souls or cosmic energy or both.  There's a bunch of talk about ""light"" and ""darkness"" and metaphors about good and evil and you get to hit people in the head with giant keys shaped like swords!  Okay, okay, I'll get serious.  You start off as protagonist Sora who lives on a small island which is suddenly engulfed in weird black mist and attacked by a bunch of monsters.  He finds a strange door and it leads him to a totally different place, where he sets out to try to find out what the flip just happened to him and how to save his home.  That's basically the beginning of the story in a nutshell.  Sora travels around to different worlds (these are small planet-shaped areas in space that are each based on a different Disney movie) in order to try to stop the monsters from overrunning everything.  I really like the story since it feels fresh and interesting.  My only complaint here is that you will hear the word ""heart"", ""light"" and ""darkness"" a little too much and it all starts to feel cheesy and heavy-handed in its message.  It doesn't detract too much though.

Battle System (score 9/10): I usually don't play action RPGs because my reflexes suck and thus they are usually too hard for me (yes, I hate to admit that but it's true).  I was very pleased to find that Kingdom Hearts has a very easy to use battle system, and the difficulty level is very approachable.  This is mainly due to the fact that this game has an excellent auto-targeting system that sort of draws you inward toward whatever enemy that you are trying to hit.  The game still feels plenty challenging in parts, (the boss battle against Maleficent springs to mind) so they did a good job of making it fun yet challenging.  My only complaint has to do with your A.I. controlled party members (Donald and Goofy).  Their A.I. is laughable bad, so don't rely on them to intelligently attack an enemy or keep you healed or anything really.  Thankfully, this isn't much of an issue since you can easily handle all the enemy yourself without having to lean on them.

Gameplay (score 9/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  I've heard some people complain about the camera but it didn't bother me much at all.  I mean, sometimes it goes a bit wonky, but it really wasn't an issue for me.  As for the rest of the controls, this is a stunningly well-polished game.  The menu navigation is good, the pacing of the game is good, you get a good variety of weapons and items to play around with - basically it all feels good and I don't have any complaints.  Also, the game never feels too grind-intensive (grinding is NOT the fun part of RPGs), so that makes me happy too.

Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Wow am I glad that I decided to pick this up.  Just think, If I'd stuck up my nose at the Disney aspect I'd have missed out on a great fun game.  So please, even if you consider yourself to be a ""mature serious gamer"" just give Kingdom Hearts a shot.  If you're just a little open-minded like I was you might enjoy yourself! Cross-over madness?"

5.0	"Best Game Ever - Again!
Fallout 3 became my favorite video game when it came out and Fallout New Vegas was a really good game, but not substantially better than or different from 3 to make it the ""top"" game.
Fallout 4, however once again does warrant ""Best Game Ever"" because of the additions they have made to it.
Essentially, the format is the same as 3 - a big (even bigger in fact) sandbox (the Commonwealth) to roam around in, people to meet (and kill) and lots of stuff to do.
A bunch of assorted factions, some of whom you just have to fight, others you have to decide whether to support or destroy.
But it is what they have added that has made this once again a stellar game.
Settlement building and maintenance, gives the game a purpose it never had before, and cooperation with various allies provides lots of rewarding missions to go on.
This time there are no limits to how much stuff you can collect / salvage and you can use your booty to construct really great settlements to attract settlers from the Commonwealth and who will maintain and improve them and even provide you with increasing resources especially if you give them a few stores.
Hint - stick a large scale water purifier in any puddle you can find in every settlement that has one, purified water is a very handy health boost and one of your best trading items.
I have chosen to be a sneaky sniper and have taken all my upgrades in that direction, now when crouching I am all but invisible to the assorted foes and my non-automatic, recon scoped silenced rifles are all upgraded to the max, not much is a serious threat now (I am at level 92), but if I want I can wade into the middle of a bunch of Legendary Supermutants with my upgraded silenced shotgun and survive.
I haven't even used a heavy weapon since the game started although I have collected hundreds of them.
If you like wandering all over the place, figuring things out as you go, doing stuff, collecting stuff and getting perks this is a truly great game.
And the resources for settlement construction are large and fun to use.
However, for me at least there are a few things that could be improved.
Most importantly, I would much prefer to be able to get the assorted factions to get along with each other as opposed to having to choose one of them, they each have so much going for them and the Commonwealth without any of them is an emptier place, I really enjoy working with and for all of them.
In fact, there ""disagreements"" are rather arbitrary and certainly not irresolvable and there is no real need in the game to force you to choose one over the other (it needs a third star in the ""Local Leader"" Perk, maybe the ""Not So Local Leader"" perk.
That is by far my biggest complaint, and, unfortunately, probably not fixable with DLC, because you usually choose early on (I have not and have refused missions that require me to do so).
Also, THERE IS NO MANUAL!
I can get the stuff I need on line, but I would have much preferred at least an online manual that covered the basic operation of the game (I still don't know why my home settlement settlers turn red).
The original disk told you to go to Bethesda.com for a manual, but there isn't one there for 4 and later disks don't even reference it.
This is a serious omission and a genuine black mark against Bethesda, but the game is so good, it makes finding what if you need online worth it.
They really need to fix this, the ""Best Game Ever"" probably is making them enough money so that they could hire somebody - to write a manual for it.
There are other things I would like to see, possibly a free construction perk that would let you build settlements and constructions anywhere.
I suspect that is computationally resource intensive, but more settlement and construction options would be nice.
They are also somewhat arbitrary about allowing settlements to be damaged or destroyed while you are not there. I have provided my settlements with completely surrounding walls and with multiple heavy machine gun turrets guarding all entrances, based on normal game dynamics a herd of legendary super mutants couldn't gain access to any of my settlements, yet it happens with frustrating regularity.
If I go there to defend one while this is happening, the defenses work and they are easily driven back with or without my help.
Also, I get frequent notices about failing to defend a specific settlement all of which are ones that I never received any notification that it needed to be defended.
This in my opinion is a bug and needs to be fixed.
If they are using audible announcements then they are still at fault.
I am 70 years old and have selected the subtitle option.
I don't hear very well and to keep the volume low enough to not disturb the rest of the population really have no chance of hearing a verbal announcement in the middle of a gun battle.
I also wish their subtitles extended through all of the verbal, radio and holotape transactions for this reason, the subtitles they provide are very minimal.
All this said, still - ""The Best Game Ever"" and I anxiously await any DLC they come up with. Best Game Ever - Again, but a few things could be done to improve it."
5.0	OK, hate is a strong word. But damn, these games are hard. They can be downright frustrating at times. You really gotta put some effort and skill into making the story progress. And THAT is why I can't put these games away - these are probably among the best stories in gaming. I want to relive the action & drama. And with this release I can do it on PS3. The gaming and controls are just as strong as they were on PS2. The remastering of the graphics for HD & 3D is high rate for all three titles. I also enjoyed the added dimension of trophy support. And $20 for all three titles is a 'cannot pass' deal. The only bad thing I can say is that this represents another step towards making my PS2 obsolete. I'm just a little bit sadder because of that. The Greatest game I Ever Hated.
5.0	"I'm not a big fan of puzzle games. You know, the ones where you sit in the same place for an hour twisting knobs and flipping switches until the door finally opens, or moving the chess pieces into just the right configuration so that you can get to the next level.
Which was why I was a little hesitant to buy Ico. Still, the graphics looked amazing, and I found it used, so I gambled and came home with the finest puzzle game I've ever played.
What's different about this puzzle game? A number of things. First, the puzzles make sense. You play Ico, a small boy locked into a deserted castle who comes upon a princess in much the same situation. The object is to get both of you out of the castle. In order to get through a level, you have to get Ico and the princess through the energy door on each level. In order to get through the energy door (which only the princess can open), you have only to get the princess there. Knowing that she can't make the amazing jumps or climb chains like Ico can, solving each level's puzzle is simply a matter of making that level accessible to the princess. This done by lowering drawbridges, pushing boxes, raising stairs, etc. so that the princess can get through the door.
Second, you're not tied to a single spot until you solve the puzzle. The levels in Ico are really big, and you'll need to move thorughout them in order to pave a path for the princess. Just make sure you don't stray from her too long or the mysterious shadows will come carry her away.
Third, there are no items you need to carry around the whole game, looking for the right place to use them. The levels are self-contained, and everything you need to solve the puzzle is right there on that level. In fact, Ico doesn't even have an inventory system.
Fouth, you can't get in so much trouble on a level that you've got to start over; you're free to experiment without fear. The only two things that make you restart the level are Ico falling too great a distance, or the princess being carried away by evil shadows.
As I mentioned at the beginning, the game is gorgeous. The castle has so many varied textures and architectures that every level is a joy to behold.  The characters move realistically, and there's a great eye to detail. Whenever Ico jumps there's a little puff of dust that blows up, the sound Ico makes changes depending on the accoustics of the room he's in, the princess reacts to Ico's actions with amazing accuracy. This attention to detail made for an extremely immersive experience.
Finally, the story. There's not much of one - get Ico and the princess out of the castle while avoiding inky shadow creatures and the evil queen. The last hour of the story, however, is really good.
Get the game and play it. Whatever you do, though, don't leave until after the final credits have rolled! Finally, a puzzle game I enjoyed!"
5.0	"This is a great game. Quite challenging and at times too challenging. I found myself wondering at times if the games makers even wanted you to be able to finish this one. If you didn't finish ""Kingdom Under Fire the Crusaders"", don't even get this one because it will be too much for you. You'll break many valuable objects in your house. It can be quite frustrating. If you were one of the seemingly very few of us that did finish the Crusaders then this is a must have and it is a steal at this price. The graphics are a little better than the last installment, the voice acting not quite as good, and yes they still have the crappy rock music. The biggest complaint people seemed to have with the last version was the music and the lack of the custom soundtrack which was promised on the box. It's like the creators said ""oh you didn't like the music huh??? well you can stick it cause here it is again"". It's still a great game and well worth the price even if just for the story lines of the seven characters in this one. It fills in some of the plot holes and unanswered questions from the last one.

Once again a great game and as usual

The statistics say...I'm always right

Showtime Out Awesome at the discounted price!"
5.0	Like all other DDR's, Konamix is a blast to play because of its refreshing game style. The graphics are only decent, but everything else in the game is excellent. Although there are a few duds, many of the songs are quite catchy. The make-your-own-steps mode is quite fun for the creative gamer. However, it's the innovative gameplay that makes Konamix what it is. If you're looking for a unique game experience, buy Konamix. More Innovative Fun.
5.0	"This game was not what i was thinking it was gonna be from looking at the backcover but it turned out to be a great game. It is one of thoes games were you have to stick to the mad or you'll get loss and say ""what do i do know"".But apart from that it's realy fun,there are a lot of things to be done in the game so even if you beat it you can still go back. A great game."
5.0	My favorite game on the Vita. Its a little short as I platinumed it in about 10 hours or so but the entire time it was a joy to play. This is a lot like littlebigplanet but where LBP excels in multiplayer, this game is an excellent single player experience. My favorite game on the Vita
5.0	it all right Five Stars
5.0	"My first Video game system, the first game I bought was ""Jurrasic Park""  To this day I am still playing it.  That shows how much fun it is.  Jurrasic Park is one of the Genisis's lost gems that is quite possibly, the greatest Jurrasic Park game ever made.  Warpath, the countless Game boy games and all the others have tried and failed to be as fun as this game.  The premise is simple, play as Dr. Grant and escape the island while trying to avoid getting eaten.  As the Raptor, fight to escape the island and reach the mainland.  Each charachter is a lot of fun to play as.  When you are grant you will traverse a river in a raft, romp through a volcano and more.  As the raptor, you attack humans (So much fun!) eat compys and try to kill grant.  Each charachter traverses through jungles, the power station, sewers, canyons and finially the visitors center.  The graphics are outstanding, they still look good even today!  The graphics for the dinosaurs are even more spectacular.  You can see each blood vesel, every tooth, which means that these beasties are extreamlly lifelike.  The raptors even learn from your actions and adapt in the later levels in the doctor grant stages!  The music and sounds are also very good, with moody jungle music, exciting river music, and a very cool Visitors center track.  The sounds of the dinosaurs are very good, they hoot, growl and roar (So realistically you will be terrified when you meet the T-rex !)  Granted, this game is not without its problems.  The main problem is dificulty.  In the Grant levels, you have to fend off hords of dinos at once, figure out some nasty jumping problems and survive the final battle.  The raptor's main problems is jumping.  Some jumping sequences are very difficult to compleate (Especially in the nasty sewer level).  The final battle for both charachters is extreamly difficult.  With the raptors, you have to hit a certian area, which isint to hard after some experementing, but with the Dr Grant battle, its almost impossible to figure out what to do!  It took me over 2 MONTHS to figure out what to do.  Its that hard.  Among the smaller problems is that there are no save points, so if you die only 1 step away from the end you have to go back to the begining (and the levels are very long) also the T-rex dosent show up enough.  But this is still a classic game.  Its reason enough to keep you genisis.
The good: Excelent graphics, music and sound.  A lot of fun to play
The bad: Can get hard.  No save points, the T-rex dosent show up enough
And the ugly: The final battle and the river level are extreamly hard One of the Genisis gems"

5.0	"I loved this game.  I love the historical (even if its fictional) setting of an early industrial revolution city.  I really enjoyed the idea of mixing science, technology, and the supernatural too.

You play as Corvo, formerly the Empress's bodyguard who was framed for her assassination.  You join a group of loyalists intent on overthrowing the current regent.  You undertake a series of missions to neutralize the allies of the regent.  Each mission is full of optional side-missions as well.  Against this, the city is rife with plague, the streets are ruled by gangs or the organized town watch under the control of the regent.  Along the way, you have the opportunity to help innocent people.  Your actions actually affect the game; if you go around killing everyone, the amount of plague increases, including the amount of rat swarms and weepers.  Conduct your coup bloodlessly, and the city improves.  Even when it comes to eliminating your mission targets, you have choices presented to you.  There is no cut-and-dry path you must follow.  Sometimes the solution is blatant, and other times you have to put 2 and 2 together.

The game play is smooth and easy to get used to.  I found the ""wheel"" very useful; it allows you to switch through powers and weapons seamlessly.

Some have complained about the graphics, and yeah they may look a little dated, but they are still pretty good.  I didn't find the graphics as a negative.

What I really liked was the depth of the game.  True, the storyline isn't the longest out there, but you WANT to play it again because there's so much to explore and see.  There are so many different ways to accomplish your missions.  On top of all that, just about every character has a backstory that you can learn about, either through direct dialogue, or by using the heart.  The heart was kind of creepy but is also very cool.  Don't forget to equip the heart and see what other characters are thinking or what their past is.

This is a game I want to play more of.  It would be awesome to have a sequel of some sorts because its a fun world to visit. Love it!"

5.0	"This game, for all that it was, was fun, exciting and enjoyable.  While some aspects of it are repetative, it is fun, and I had a blast.
You are a monster tamer, in the tradition of your father.  You must make your way deeper and deeper into the mysterious tower near town, to find fortune and achieve your destiny.  Each trip into the tower puts you at the beginning -- but your animals retain their skills.  You also can keep weapons and other items you find, but if you die, they are lost.
It is at least worth a rental if not a buy.  I give it five stars because it kept me very entertained, and I have been disenchanted with most of the SquareSoft games lately.  This really picked my spirits up.  If you don't mind a bit of repetition, you might not find this so bad.
You are also given quests to find objects in the tower, as well as the opportunity to build up and improve almost every building in your village.  Perhaps the best, and most amusing part, is how several women vie for your attentions, and you have to find the particular way to make them fall for you.
Not necessarily replayable, but great for at least a test drive. What the Dreamcast Time Stalkers game should have been."
5.0	With the variety of hidden object games on the market, many of which are copycats, I'm looking for something a bit different in hidden object games these days.  And Pure Hidden provies that something different.  Through a series of hidden object and puzzle levels, players interact with scenes that are works of art.  With a clear Asian influence, many of the scenes contain Asian objects, or works of Asian art.  It's hard to adequately describe the scenes and objects presented, but I strongly recommend everyone who enjoys hidden object games try at least the free trial.  This really is not your stock hidden object game. Something Different

5.0	I seriously love this game. To be honest when I first got it I figured it would be a fun one-time kinda game, nothing too great, but I actually thoroughly enjoyed it. I've beaten the game maybe three times now, possibly more, I love it! To warn parents or anyone sensitive to violence, there is a lot of it and it can be kind of gruesome at times, but I honestly can't remember much foul language or really any sexual scenes. Really I didn't find it offensive. Like I said, I loved it and can't wait for dishonored II. Great Game!

5.0	"The range alone makes this worth it--I've personally seen the embedded mousepad go almost 60 feet (had to trek out to the backyard and watch through the window to test this out).  Logitech really did master the receiver here, and the scarcity and price of this item is really unfortunate considering its usefulness and range.
I did some research as to why the range is so fantastic, and found out that Logitech uses the same USB receive for this unit as in one of their better business presentation devices--so, that explains that; you need range at a hotel presentation, so this keyboard gets that?  Wow! (look up 'Logitech 2.4GHz Cordless Presenter' on Amazon, see 5th photo in it).
How many living rooms, dens, 'man-caves', or even frat-houses have the big-screen over 20 feet from the recliner?
Okay, now, I use mine for HTPCs, and it absolutely wrecks any install--I mean that in a positive way, too.  No drivers, batteries stretch forever, power button makes this KB great for homes with cats, toddlers, or anyone else with 'unproven IQ's'.
The only thing I could ever see anyone being negative about with this unit is 1) its lack of media buttons (some of which can be compensated-for by using Windows short-cut keys and after-market free downloads to start certain apps), and 2) as it was made for PS3, no 'Windows' keys (they're replaced by left/right mouse buttons), and anyone who uses those knows what to do there.
Batteries really do last forever with this unit--I've even come home, having forgotten to turn my power button off, and found one of my cats laying on the KB, for who-knows-how-long, and, of course, it worked perfectly on the rechargeable batteries I use for eons (non-geeks: 'weeks', or 'interminable').
Basically, wish Logitech had stuck with this one, as it gets hard when all your buddies (in my case, also customers) keep wanting to buy your own keyboard, and I have run out of easy options for purchase, so now I look like a hoarder, or at least selfish.
So, I'm placing this review on Amazon a little late, but am also going right after Logitech's next unit, their current Wii wireless, which looks good, but (savvy) no mousepad!
I guess the basic idea I'm saying here is:
1) Logitech, why mess with perfection (and drop it from production)?
2) You should go back and re-release this baby for HTPC!  Whether you think the idea of HTPCs is selling or not, everybody could use this from anything from desktop forward! Dream KB for HTPC"

5.0	"The Nokia N-Gage has brought multiuse gaming to the world. This handheld device is about the size of a GBA and has a great MP3 player, cellphone, address book, calendar, FM radio, web browser and more!
People who look at and judge this device solely as a ""GBA SP contender"" are missing the point. This system is more like a super-charged palm pilot than a GBA SP. You can surf the web from it, share images with friends, give them a call when you're running late, look up your calendar appointments, and then play a game of Super Monkey Ball or tetris while you wait at the doctor's!
First, the size. The screen on the Nokia is a bit smaller than the GBA SP but no different than most handhelds. It is very crisp and bright, very easy to read. The GBA SP has a lot of 'wasted space' but the Nokia is actually well designed - easy access to the MP3 area, radio and main menu. Buttons to make calls are right up on top, and the gaming controls are raised and easy to get to.
The graphics are quite sharp. The two games I'm addicted to right now are Super Monkey Ball (just about exactly the same as the GameCube version) and Puyo Pop which is a jazzed up Tetris game. Both are fun to play with voices, music and graphics. The various menus to get to your notepad, calendar, calculator, etc. are customizeable and easy to use.
The radio works very well and brings in radio stations easily, letting you set favorites and give them names. The MP3 system works off of memory cards that are shared with the Otis and other MP3 devices - the USB cable lets you move playlists on and off your PC. The sound both through the headphones and through the built-in speakers is clear and strong.
A few people have complained that you look ""silly"" holding this system to your head to make calls. So wait, they're spending $300 on a PDA system that can browse the web, play games, and play music - and their concern is about ""looking cool"" in front of their friends? Making phone calls is a normal part of life - it's not a catwalk on a runway!
On one hand, yes $300 is a lot of money. But on the other hand I own a cell phone, a GBA SP, a portable radio, a high-end MP3 player, a Palm Pilot and have paid for currency converters and other add-on software. It is a ROYAL pain when we go on motorcycle trips or trips over to Europe to carry 8 different devices, worry about charging them and keeping the batteries stocked. When we're traveling we use the radio for weather updates, the MP3 to play books-on-tape, the palm pilot for hotel information, calendars and currency converters, the cell phone to call ahead and let people know when we're arriving. When we have down-time, we play the games and enjoy the relaxation. This Nokia is PERFECT for those tasks. One device to charge, no batteries to buy, small size, easy to use.
My two complaints with the system both involve the games. One is that there aren't many out right now - but that is normal for any brand new release. The second is that to change games you have to take out the battery. But I don't tend to game-swap every 15 seconds - I'll play a game for quite a while before moving on to a new one. So neither issues are huge for me. If you're a new-game-every-10-minutes person you might get tired of changing the cartridges constantly.
In general, if all you're after is a game-player to play Mario 24 hours a day, and don't own a cell phone, MP3 player, calendar, radio, or any other device, then this might not be the system for you. Just stick with your GBA SP and enjoy. But if you DO own one or several of the other devices, I highly recommend grabbing a Nokia and giving your other devices away to your friends. After a short while you'll wonder why you used to bother filling your pockets with 10 different devices, when this one N-gage can do it all! A great multi-function device that plays games too!"
5.0	It was so EASY!! After reading many of these reviews, I was nearly too terrified to purchase this. I thought this was going to be extremely difficult. I will admit that I suck at placing on screen protectors, but I applied this one PERFECTLY. There were no bubbles, dust, or weird gaps. This application design allows you the flexibility to place the screen cover in the perfect position. Make sure you are not bouncing or moving around too much so you don't make dust particles fly around. Innovative Application

1) Highly addictive and i mean highly addictive as you will be racing to get to first place.
2) The HD makes it a very beautiful atmospheric game to play especially since the game comes with alot of option.
3) Wii u owners or those who do not own one, please get it. you will not regret it. Nintendo, within my heart."

That was fun. I don't play with my ps4 as much as I would like to. I put it down when I was practicing being in a group of other players from who knows where - the long and short of it is, I was playing an action game (Destiny) and it forces you to do at least one group mission, so I do. ... someone saved my life (about thirty times) and when they needed my help, I killed them by accident. I couldn't run out of the game fast enough!  lol

Just Dance has that similar awareness of how unashamed most of this generation is and allows you to share yourself dancing to the world and -- More power to you. If you are like me and bit more shy, be very careful to select the right button that doesn't send your bouncing body to the world.

This is very intuitive play and the animations are wonderful. (I wish they would just animate my image, I would share it then). So the idea is that you follow the dancer and do what she or he does. Little icons on the bottom right help you and if you match their image they fall off the screen. All I know is that i was moving and having fun.  Also as you do something right, the camera registers it on the top of the screen as bad, good, ok and perfect. I was lucky to make it through to the end of one song. What a great way to move , something I don't do enough of.

You can use your smart phone and their app for seamless integration, your playstation camera or Playstation move. Each will register your moves.  Karaoke counts for extra points.

So I can close this review with a clich ""for children of all ages"" and feel comfortable. It's a lot of fun and a great way to keep your finger on the pulse of ""newish"" music of this generation. Most importantly if you are over 45-- get this to help stay in shape. Fun enough to help me forget that I am achieving my fitbit goals!"

5.0	I haven't played this game myself yet but I will. I've been watching it being played by the person I bought it for and it looks like an absolute blast. I'm looking forward to playing it just as soon as I get past some other games I'm in the middle of right now. just a spectator so far

-Easy mute with the mic up, that actually works.

5.0	"I was very surprised when I heard that Dontnod was on the verge of bankruptcy while making this game. It seemed like a game where a true artist had a lot of money and said ""I'm going to make a totally great and unique game and I don't care how much it costs or even who likes it"". Indeed no punches were pulled for the sake of commercial success, the mature rating should be taken seriously. Episode 5 is very dark and went right to the edge for me. The story is about a photographer. This is fitting, for the game has some of the best photography I've ever seen. The soundtrack is beautiful, easily the best I've ever heard. Great care was taken to put these songs and images together at the right time. The emotional impact of all this sound and vision hits hard only because I cared deeply about Max and Chloe. And therein lies the greatness of this game, the caring. One must not be in a rush to get from point A to point B while playing. Life is Strange should be sipped like fine coffee that's a little too hot. It seemed like a game where a true artist had a lot ..."
5.0	"Nintendo has done it again. This is an amazing product and I am thrilled to have it. First of all, let me tell you a bit about myself and my family who also have been using the system. I am 27 years old, I have two children, and am currently very pregnant with my third. I've been wanting this game for ages because of how fun and interesting it looked. My husband got it for me as my Mother's Day present and when he brought it home, I sat by and watched him set it up and start to use it because I was unsure if I could do any of the games. Well I can, and I do!

Between my husband (28 years old), my four and a half year old son (shame on you saying this is not for children!), and me we have really explored the Wii Fit. I'll break it down categorically.

Body Test: As it's been mentioned already, this is fun but also needs to be looked at on an individual basis. It does not measure fat so even though it gives you a BMI reading, a very muscular person is going to be WAY off. So are pregnant ones! :) However, for your average Jane and Joe, I think it's a great idea and pretty fair.

Yoga: I haven't done any of the Yoga yet. HOWEVER, my husband and my son both have! And this is where the Wii Fit really is glorious. My husband would NEVER go to a Yoga class. I guarantee he would NEVER do a Yoga video. And yet, there he was trying the Tree and Warrior poses! And really, this all thanks to our four year old who wanted to try them when he saw them. I would never think of a small child doing Yoga but there he was and having fun with it.

Strength Training: My husband's favorite and the four year old's too. Last night, my husband strung together a bunch of strength training exercises and was DYING towards the end. He did push ups, lunges, squats, and jacknifes and they really pushed him. Some people say it's not fun to go from one activity to the other but you're supposed to take breaks between things anyways so I don't see what the big deal is. If you're so concerned about not moving, jog in place while you're navigating the menus. They are hardly overwhelming with choices and the Favorites menu is fantastic for this.

Aerobics: This is where I get into it as much as I can and this section has one of my son's favorite games. I adore the hula hoop. And even as much as I adore it, I can't play it too much because to really get your hoops moving, you're going to have to go FAST and I get pretty winded right now. The other one I really have fun with is the Basic Step. What a blast. I should mention here that my 52 year old mother came over last night. We set her up and she did some games too and LOVED the step aerobics. Again, another way the Wii Fit really shines. This is the only workout I have EVER done where you're laughing while doing it because how fun it is. My mom was cracking up doing the Basic Step. The other game on here that gets a lot of play is the Run. My son loves this one and I love watching him run in place and burning off energy without even knowing it. ""Mommy is this supposed to be tiring?"" ""YES!"" I can't wait to keep unlocking activities.

Balance Games: My other favorite section right now. This is where you find Soccer, Ski Slalom, Ski Jump, Table Games, and TightRope for instance. Personally, I love the Ski Jump, Table Games, and TightRope. My husband likes the Soccker and Slalom, and my son doesn't really care for many except maybe the TightRope and the Ski Games. But even then, he prefers watching us play these. These are a great time and don't think because they're balance games, you're not going to be moving much. The Ski Slalom and Soccer have you moving left and right pretty fast!

Conclusion: I really think this belongs in every household in this country. There really is something for everybody on here. And what's more, I think it can really open doors for you that you'd never even consider! I am telling you watching my husband do yoga was crazy. And watching my son doing push ups and side planks was out of this world. I personally despise gyms and the entire gym culture. And exercise DVDs are insanely limited in scope. This is the perfect solution for someone like me. For one, I can pop on whenever I want to, however I want to. My family and I can spend some time together doing something good for us and it definitely doesn't feel that way. There are no tricky machines to figure out, no waiting for equipment, and no monotony. I also love the way the sensors help you get the poses just right-- something you canNOT do with a fitness DVD or if you're at the gym by yourself. Way to go on this one Nintendo. I can't wait to see what other uses you come up with for the Balance Board. Wife, Hubby, Four Year Old: We Love Wii Fit!"

5.0	"I'm a 42 year old man, who just received ""Lego Indiana Jones"" for his birthday. Now, I'd been hearing about Lego Star Wars for a long time, and how much fun it was. But I just didn't buy it. I mean, how could having a Lego experience compare with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Battlefront/dp/B0001NE48U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Battlefront</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Battlefront-II/dp/B0009O7HVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, which was extremely realistic and fun to boot? Well, the truth is, in a campy and fun way, the Lego series takes what you love about the movies, and makes it truly a fun, interactive experience.

Lego Indiana Jones follows the plots of the three movies faithfully (with a few minor plot detail changes that totally don't detract from the enjoyment). Each ""movie"" has six missions in it, and your goal is to make it through each level. The process of making it through the level is not at all challenging, but really is smart in it's intuitiveness and manor. You instinctively know what to do in each level, and sometimes the challenge comes from trying to figure out how to do it. Embedded in each level are ten ""treasure chests"" filled with an artifact piece. Find all ten, and you get an artifact from that mission. Normally, I'm not into the side missions, or extra bonus things that some video games have, but finding these treasure chests became an obsession of mine!

All through the game, Lego has embedded some wry humor and playful puns that only enhance the game. For example, in the min-movie that opens ""Temple of Doom"", Willie's opening dance number is hilarious for her coughing. Since the Lego people don't actually talk but grunt at each other, it makes it even more funny. And Elsa Schneider's greeting at the Venice pier is one for the record books!

I'm throughly loving this game, and as soon as I am finished (I'm purposefully playing it slow to get the most enjoyment out of it over the longest period of time), it's off to Lego Star Wars for me! Highly recommended for all ages, and all Indy fans! Indy and Lego: Right!"

5.0	"Let it be known that pinball is about the only arcade game I like to play when out and about at the arcade or the mall.  And being such a avid player, I was a little leary about how satisfying  playing pinball on a Wii would be.

It is a blast.  Everything from launching the ball with varying force, shaking (and tilting) the table and realistic flipper response depending on the table is part of the experience.  The manner in which you view the table during play is also very cool.  The screen shot moves how your eyes would in a real setting making the play exciting and realistic.  The selection of tables available is a best of the best from 1970 to 1990.

When you need a break from shooting zombies in Resident Evil or trying to get past a boss in Zelda, this game is it.  It is also alot of fun with company over because you don't have to be a video game pro or possess superior controller skills to have a blast. When you need a break from shooting zombies..."

5.0	this game is awesome. its cool blowing up pretty much anything. this had all the right elements to me. regenerating health, I hated fighting on gta 4 losing health then having to run and grab a hot dog. I love the regenerating health saves trouble finding health packs. the action was just right not too hard not too easy. I will admit the climbing is a little slow but to me its more realistic. I even liked the side missions, they didn't seem tacked on like pick up a certain car and bring it back, or bowling! I loved the mission where you had to blow up the chemical factory, everything you shot was explosive. I would say I loved the saboteur as much if not more than red faction guerilla and that's saying alot cuz I absolutely had a blast with red faction. Dont hesitate. GO BUY THIS GAME!

5.0	"Before I get started, I do have to say that I know this game isn't flawless. The cars could be a little easier to attain, the career could be a little more long, the basic races could be a little more challenging, and the car customizations could have a few more options. However, the game overall was a great play. I had so much fun playing the career that I had a hard time ever putting the controller down. I also like the amount of options you have towards what kind of racing you want to do (i.e. career, quick race, etc.). I also thought that the graphics were pretty much amazing for the PS2. I really liked the music and actually have bought two CD's by artists featured on the game. I like the different classes and types of cars. Also, I found the ""partner"" racing style to be pretty fun (although at times ineffective). Canyon races are always fun, and I play the game all the time even though I've already beaten it. Also, I LIKE THE NIGHT RACING! If there was one thing I hated about Most Wanted, it was that you race in broad freakin daylight. I have to admit, you do have to be a Need for Speed fan to fully enjoy the game. If you don't like racing games, don't play it! But this is seriously a step up for the Need for Speed line.

5.0	"  The Bureau: XCOM Declassified's entire floundering tactical shooter campaign wondering how it planned to pull off a plausible prequel backstory to the freshly rebooted XCOM universe. When I got to the end, it didn't even seem to try, content to let us wonder why this 1960s version of XCOM didn't bother to tell 2010s XCOM (of XCOM: Enemy Unknown) that hostile aliens exist and that there's a closet full of working plasma guns somewhere. Not making sense doesn't seem to bother The Bureau, either in story or in its flawed attempt to use permanent death mechanics and strangely shoddy construction. But it sure bothered me.
20:53 The Bureau: XCOM Declassified Dev Commentary
If the alien-invasion plot could keep its act together for the course of its roughly 15-hour campaign and work as a stand-alone alternate universe, I'd be totally willing to ignore that admittedly nit picky continuity issue. Alas, despite one really good idea that cleverly toys with the way we experience games through characters, it completely falls apart. The way main character Agent William Carter reacts to a major revelation is pretty much the exact opposite of what a sane person would probably do in that situation. It's to the point where I have to wonder if a bug might caused the wrong dialogue option to be selected. This isn't the only inexplicable moment in this baffling story, but it's the most spectacularly weird.
What does work, at a basic level at least, is The Bureaus tactical combat. Like Mass Effect and Brothers in Arms, each mission against the alien invaders is a linear
The Bureau: XCOM Declassified
AUGUST 20, 2013
The battle of humans against an invading alien force erupts in The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, a new story and unique gameplay experience set inside one of gaming's most storied and beloved franchises.
 MUCH MORE
DAN STAPLETON SAYS
More tactful tactics
Spec Ops: The LineBrothers in Arms: Hell's HighwayMass Effect 3 series of encounters where you and the enemy take cover and open fire, then try to maneuver to flank the other team or drive them from cover using grenades and special abilities. Most of those come from the two lightly customizable XCOM agents that accompany Carter on every mission, and each of the four agent classes has a set that unlocks as they level up in combat. Theyre mostly useful: abilities like the Snipers critical shot and holographic distraction and the Engineers deployable turret and land mines can combine into some satisfyingly lethal crossfires and traps.
Squaddies are ordered around using a well-done UI, which allows you to easily set waypoints for your squaddies in the super-slowmo Combat Focus mode (somewhat reminiscent of Fallout 3s VATS), which you can enable at any time. Its biggest aggravation is in how it sometimes refuses to let you throw a weapon without a walkable path to the landing point, but otherwise its a very capable tool.
In the other corner is a new alien race called the Zujari, a bland race that fights exactly like humans with advanced technology. Their minions  classic XCOM aliens like impish, mouthless sectoids, lumbering mutons, swift silacoid blobs, and flying drones  all have much more character. With several varieties of Zujari, though, the enemy diversity is respectable, and manages to keep fights from going stale too quickly.
01:32The Bureau: XCOM Declassified - Battle Focus Trailer
Here's where it all falls apart: The concept of squaddie permadeath (borrowed from X-COM: UFO Defense and Enemy Unknown), simply doesnt work properly in a game with one character that must live. Any situation where a fight went so badly that I wasn't able to reach a downed squaddie before his bleedout timer expired was so bad I was probably doomed anyway. And when Carter dies, he and any dead squaddies are revived at the checkpoint to try again. It's a bizarre system that punishes partial failure more severely than total failure.
Of course, thats all rendered nearly moot by a revival system that you have to consciously avoid exploiting. Even while they're being pounded on by a huge muton, your two agents can constantly revive each other in an absurd seesaw dance of perpetual near-death. Between those two goofy systems, I lost only two men on my Veteran difficulty playthrough.
12:05The Evolution of The Bureau: XCOM Declassified
Between missions you return to base to wander around and converse with other XCOM agents and scientists. The base is large, yet theres not much to do there other than a couple of simple puzzles. The only thing you need to do there is equip your squad, another key idea borrowed from classic X-COM thats reduced to pointless busywork by an infinite supply of clearly superior weaponry and a lack of a research mechanic (despite franchise tradition and an entire section of the XCOM base labeled as research labs).
Captured alien weapons aren't anything special, either. They have some flashy effects, but they're simply more powerful red- or green-glowing variations of ballistic firearms, and none stands out as the slightest bit distinctive. Even the Blaster Launcher is nothing but a green rocket launcher.
I can give the Bureau credit for its 1960s setting, which looks pretty good thanks to fine detail in both the base and the towns and rural farms you're sent out to liberate. A farm mission stands out as particularly atmospheric, with battles playing out from behind tractors and bales of hay, leading to an unexpected hidden area. Scattered notes and voice recordings from civilians succumbing to an alien virus give it a touch of real creepiness. Characters' faces aren't bad, though not particularly well lip-synced to their mostly wooden voice acting. It's commendable that conversations can play out in dramatically different ways based on early conversation choices, such as whether you play good cop or bad cop in an interrogation. I cant say I have any desire to replay The Bureau, though. x- file like of sort same"
5.0	This is without a doubt, one of the most fantastic games aviliable ever for the PC, if not the best. It contains amazing graphics even if you don't have a 3D accelerator. It has a envolving story line and challenges you to  solve puzzles and unravel what happened after an explosion turns your  colleagues into aliens. But parents, watch out. This game contains EXTREME  gore, involving you to shoot and kill enemies resulting in buckets of gore  as well as severed heads, bloody limbs and the persons heart. This can be  turned off but trails of blood still remain (very bloody) as well as the  scare factor. If your over 14 I'd say you can handle it, but anyone under  10 should not get this game! Great, but use caution!
5.0	I didn't think there was anyway that this game would live up to the hype, but it did plus some.  There should be no doubt that this is the game of the year, possibly the game of the decade.  It has left me wanting more from rockstore games.  I am really excited about LA Noire, but its been put in the impossible position of having to follow Red Dead Redemption.  But Thats the standard Rockstar games have set and I'm ready to see what they pull out of there hat next. One of the best EVER

5.0	This game is both fun and addictive. The battle system is a lot better than what Square Enix did for XV, it what one expects from an action RPG; being able to map certain skills to button and your magic not causing friendly fire damage. The story is interesting and you can also switch between teammates of which there 14 of (most of them with the exception of two are named after a playing card). All of them have a a different type of weapon which makes it typing them all out interesting (I loved Ace and his playing cards). As far as graphics go I first brought this game on the PS4 and when I got the Xbox One I brought it again ; it looks a lot better one the Xbox One then it did on the PS4. If your looking to pick up a Final Fantasy for either system I would highly recommend this one over XIV or XV. An amazing remake.
5.0	"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Far-Cry-3/dp/B0050SYV70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Far Cry 3</a>&nbsp;was easily one of the best games for my 360, so FC4 was one I was most looking forward to when upgrading to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xbox-One/dp/B00KAI3KW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xbox One</a>.  I was not disappointed.

The game kicks off strong with a run-through-the-jungle melee of insanity that immediately reminded me how lacking some of the other games I'd played recently have been (ahem,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AC-Unity/dp/B00J48C36S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AC Unity</a>).  With drop-dead gorgeous next-gen graphics, FC4 has every element that I loved in FC3 played up even larger, louder, and more gauche.

The game itself feels like it's built right on top of the FC3 engine and framework, so at times it can be a little too familiar.  Maps are not as big as other games, and the mechanic still has legacy hiccups, but all of that can be overlooked while raiding a radio tower and trashing an outpost.  There's a new deal with karma events, which are a cool concept executed poorly (it always takes Ubi a couple tries to polish these things out - it should be better by FC5).  My other complaint is that dogs often ruin your best tactics - you'll see what I mean.

But despite a few faults, Far Cry 4 is easily one of the best games yet for the new generation.  It's raucous fun that is challenging, at times maddening, and never takes itself too seriously.  The problem was that I had it for the Xbox One and my pals who normally play this sort of game are on PS4.  No worries, Sony has an excellent, exclusive solution.  Since only one of my friends had FC4 yet, I was able to send my other friends an open invite that let us play together for two hours, giving them a flavor of what they were missing (and dragging them out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destiny/dp/B00BGA9Y3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destiny</a>&nbsp;for a bit).  That was enough to convince them they should be playing FarCry - so excellent job, Sony, and good for me.  That after a couple hours of demo people are ready to throw down $60 to keep playing speaks volumes about how good the game is.

5.0	"I've played quite a few MLB games on the old Playstation and the Nintendo 64.  From ""High Heat Baseball"" to ""Triple Play,"" I've played my share.  One thing that I really enjoyed about the ""Triple Play"" games is the fact that you had to warm-up your bullpen to get them ready to pitch.  ""MVP Baseball 2004"" has that and all of the other great aspects of the ""Triple Play"" games, plus loads of other features that can't be matched by other baseball formats.

One of the neatest things about this game is all of the throwback uniforms, legendary players and stadiums that you can earn by performing certain feats during a game such as winning a game in extra innings, getting ten runs, hitting .600, etc.  For every feat you perform you earn a certain amount of points.  After you accumulate enough points, you can ""purchase"" throwback uniforms, from the cool ones(Astros) to the wretched ones(Pirates), or players.  Once you've acquired all of the players, you then have access to some new stadiums.  You can also play in the minors.  The Zephyrs are still part of the Astros organization on this game, and they give you access to players like Brandon Backe.

The gameplay is as close to the real thing as I've ever seen.  Multiple camera angles capture every move, every slide, and even little things like eye movement and spin on the ball.  You recognize pitchers by their throwing style and hitters like Jeff Bagwell and Gary Sheffield by their unique batting stances(Craig Counsell's unorthodox stance is also included).  Ichiro looks like Ichiro. Jeff Kent looks like Jeff Kent.  In fact, I'd say that ninety-percent of all of the players actually look like themselves.  Only a few that I've seen look nothing like their actual selves(Morgan Ensberg and Adam Everett come to mind).  Players make diving catches and barrel through the catcher as if you're seated on the third baseline.  Pitches are delivered with perfection(if you throw it properly) and you can differentiate between a curve, slider, knuckleball, etc. when your waiting at the plate.

If you can't already tell, I'm a big Astros fan.  Minute Maid Park looks beautiful on this game.  When you hit a homerun, the train takes off across the tracks just like the real deal.  You can see Seahawks Stadium in the outfield of the Mariner's Safeco Field.  The Green Monster at Fenway has the newly installed seats on top of it.  In other words, a lot of attention was given to details that many other games look beyond.

Bat control is very good.  You can pretty much put the ball wherever you want if you have a player at the plate who can handle the Rocket's pitches.  Bunting is also pretty easy to master.

I highly recommend this game for its lifelike presentation of the grand old game.  It's pretty easy to learn and the control is excellent once you have it downpat.  Also, there are tons of features and playing style to choose from.

A great buy.

By the way, the Expos will live forever on this game!!!!! It's Almost Like Being There"
5.0	"This collection of games from Namco is a blast from the past for anyone who grew up playing video games at home on Atari or who spent their entire life savings at the arcades.  The games included on this collection are:  ""Ms. Pac Man"", ""Dig Dug"", ""Galaxion"", ""Phozon"", ""Pole Position II"", and ""Tower Of Druaga"".  For those who don't own a PS2, NAMCO MUSEUM VOL. 3 is worth owning because of ""Ms. Pac Man"", ""Dig Dug"", and ""Galaxion"".

""Ms. Pac Man"" is just as fun to play as the original ""Pac Man"" but is just slightly more difficult and gives a more continues the ""story"" begun in ""Pac Man"".

""Dig Dug"" is one of the classic arcade games of the 80s.  The game seems easy enough to play (dig your way through dirt, kill monsters before they kill you, and collect vegetables). However, the game becomes increasingly difficult as you progress and before you know it your running away more than you are shooting at monsters because there's just too many of them.

""Galaxion"" is another arcade classic.  It takes the premise of ""Space Invaders"" one step further so that instead of defending a planetary base from destruction and invasion, you're in space trying to destroy an enemy fleet before they blow you up.  In ""Space Invaders"" you could hide your gun behind turrets, but there is no place to hide in ""Galaxion.""

The other three games on the collection are fairly forgettable and were somewhat obscure in the day.  ""Phozon"" is a type of puzzle game where you try to match up the phozons with the pattern without getting blown to bits.  ""Pole Position II"" is a racing game where you blow up if you get too far off course or run into items.  In that sense its realistic. However, the game is extremely difficult to play because the analog component of the paddle isn't compatible and you don't have a joystick so you're forced to drive your car using the directional buttons. What a pain.  ""Tower of Druaga"" is the final game on the collection.  It involves trying to get Gil to climb through all the levels of the Tower. It's kind of like an early video game version of role playing. It's kind of interesting, but it takes an incredibly long amount of time to defeat.

Overall, this is a great collection for anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s.  For those who are too young to remember Atari, the game is nice to play because of its retro and anything retro is cool. You Know You Grew Up In the 1980s If . . ."

5.0	Crysis 1 is still the best out of the 3.  The 2nd 2 games are linear and don't have the open world that Crysis 1 had.  And consoles probably couldn't run Crysis 1 anyway.  But this is still a good game.  It's still better than 90% of shooters that are out today in 2015!  The developers of this game actually pay attention to small details in the game, which makes it more immersive and realistic. I like how you can interact with many small objects in the game.  PS3 graphics aren't as good as PC, but hopefully they come out with a PS4 version or maybe a Crysis 4.  This game needs a powerful machine to run on. Not as good as Crysis 1, but still good.
5.0	"My initial fears that this was just an overhyped Resident Evil clone were quickly put to rest - although the two games share a genre and pieces of a control scheme, their personalities couldn't be further apart. Where the first three Resident Evils focused on the cheesier, blood-n-guts style with a hint of puzzle solving in the name of variety, Silent Hill 2 concentrates much more on the unknown, the unexplained and the psychologically disturbing. Where Resident Evil 2 is horror in the vein of Dawn of the Dead, Silent Hill 2 is more along the lines of The Ring or The Shining.

It's that establishment of potential horror, not the actual moments of battle where the monster lies revealed, that are most successful in Silent Hill and, honestly, in most of the better films within the genre. To say that this game is lacking in real scary moments would be both unfair and untrue... I jumped more times than I'm comfortable to admit while playing through this one in the dark... but it properly uses such moments as an accent, rather than a crutch. It's been said that the most horrific monster in the world can never be captured on film, because it resides within the collective imaginations of the audience. Hollywood can never frighten you as badly as you can frighten yourself. It's this kind of mentality that I see reflected in Silent Hill 2 from the very get-go. Sure, they do eventually show you the monsters, and they're significantly horrific on their own, but they're all little more than pawns in this scheme, even the bosses. They're just around to nudge your mind in the right direction, so that the little shadows you'll catch darting around at the edge of your field of vision can be more effective and more relative to the story.

In terms of atmosphere, there's very little that this game does wrong. It's learned all the right lessons from the progression and evolution of cinematic horror and applied them to the incomparably personal experience of a quality video game. It's established a unique style, a great cluster of settings, and a wonderful premise (the lead character, James, receives a letter from his wife three years after her death, pleading with him to visit the town of Silent Hill) but the actual follow-through of the story and the accompanying character interactions are lacking. This reminds me of Eternal Darkness in a way, in that a lot of the strange occurrences and developments seem completely random and are never connected to the story itself. Almost universally, the cast is detached from reality, lacking in personality and in emotion, which works within the confines of the plot but results in the player never being fully drawn into the game's world.

I came away from this game feeling as though I'd read a short story that had been padded out and enlongated thanks to the inclusion of a dozen different unrelated asides. It's a fifty page story stretched over the course of a three hundred page novel. You'll meet five non-playable centric characters around the city, but only two of them have a real bearing on the plot, which is itself little more than a series of vague insinuations. It's a real shame, too, because all of the pieces have been set in the right place to accommodate for a much more striking, intriguing tale.

Controlling James as he explores the city is fairly easy, if not entirely ideal. Several elements of the Resident Evil control scheme have surfaced with Silent Hill 2's configuration, most notably the ""boat steering"" movement controls. If you didn't like standing in one place, pivoting and then running directly forward or backward in Capcom's zombie-fest, you aren't going to like it here. Personally, I've grown used to it and the steering doesn't seem to get in my way any more, but I can certainly see why some players would have developed a bitter hatred for it. One thing that differs from Resident Evil's traditional setup, however, is a fully polygonal environment and a free-roaming camera. What that means is less cheap scares and monsters hiding in plain sight, and a much more interactive experience.

I'll come right out and admit to savoring every last bit of the visual direction and graphical representations of Silent Hill 2. If there's one area that this game absolutely nails, it's this: everything from the character designs to the environments to the simple, yet undeniably successful, film grain texture that overlays every moment of gameplay... it's all an unbridled success. This is among the most thought-out, fully realized visual productions I've ever seen in a game, and even the hardware limitations of the original Xbox are addressed in a concise, effective manner that works within the confines of the big picture. The dreamlike state of your visit to the town explains away the boundaries around the playable area... you don't run into an invisible wall, there are just mysterious tarps or bottomless pits sealing off certain parts of town. You'll accept it at face value because, hey, you just fired three rounds into a set of animated mannequin legs.

Another noteworthy visual innovation is the complete lack of any kind of heads-up display or on-screen indicator. With the multitude of potential actions and inventory items that seem to have completely overtaken the industry, it's a nice change of pace to see a game with just a character and an environment on the screen at any given time. It not only keeps the playing field open for some of the more subtle effects, but also makes the experience even more akin to that of watching a movie.

The appearance of the monsters remains among the most successfully frightening I've ever seen. It's easy to throw sharp teeth, bumpy skin and red eyes onto something, call it an enemy and commence with the cheap scares. What's not so easy is introducing a baddie that's horrifying if just because you have no idea what in the living hell it really is. The bad guys of SH2 are, obviously, the latter. They don't always look so much like they're attacking you out of anger, so much as they're lashing out because they're constantly in pain and see anything that moves as a possible cause. I almost felt pity for these things, their existence is so pitiful, so filled with tragedy.

I can't rightfully discuss the visuals of this game without giving some love to the incredible lighting effects, either. I'd truthfully rank this game ahead of the original Splinter Cell in that category, and Sam Fisher's first romp was released almost specifically to show off everything the Xbox could do in that respect. In Silent Hill 2, you travel the entire city with just a flashlight, which (needless to say) is handled magnificently. Everywhere you go, that single light source is playing with your surroundings to cast all sorts of bizarre, frightening, downright malicious shadows throughout the room

I adored the majority of my experience with Silent Hill 2. The story, while thin at times, is generally workable and never really insultingly self-indulgent. The length of the game bothered me a bit, as the main game map is quite elaborate and seemed to have a lot of unrealized potential, but that goes back to the weakness of the basic plot and the lack of any major side stories of consequence. If you've got a weekend to kill and want to be emotionally shaken, this is exactly the game for you. It features one of the best all-around identities in the history of the industry, takes dozens of hints from the lessons learned by its predecessors in film, and is truly horrifying on several levels. If the story had been a little thicker and the cast had been fleshed out a little further, this would've been close to perfect. Hauntingly detailed, mentally unsettling, but just a bit too short..."
5.0	"I've used plenty of high end mice before. I actually had a Corsair M90, which retails around $50. This mouse, which is currently only around half that, is honestly better in my opinion.

The mouse has all I could ever want in a mouse. Perfect size, and the awesome place to put my thumb. Adjustable mouse speed. And a great design, with cool lights to boot!

If you've looked at fancier mice and said, ""Wow, I gotta have that,"" I would reconsider. Save a little bit of cash and buy this still very fancy mouse. The Gigabyte M6800 mouse is also very good if you're looking for something even cheaper, but still a solid performer. Not expensive, but still impressive"

This is a MotionPlus controller, which is required if you are going to use it with the Wii U.  It also works with the Wii, of course.  If you ever plan on upgrading I highly recommend buying only MotionPlus controllers at this point.  I had to replace 2 regular remotes when I got my Wii U.  I honestly could never really tell the difference between the MotionPlus and non MotionPlus ones on the Wii.

I like the speaker on Wii remotes, since it works in cool ways in some games (like acting as your ""phone"" and ringing, and when you pick it up you can listen to the ""caller"" through the remote.). Just awesome.  When a nunchuck is plugged in, it can function as a normal controller.

I'm sure most people know enough about what Wii remotes are at this point and are mostly buying this one for the design. Great controller"

For me the only way to take out enemies is with a head shot(once you get your rifle),cause you have plenty of time to set up your shot. I only wish this game had more levels. Before you know it your done. But its still an awesome game. The gameplay is very smooth. I think its better than the first SPLINTER CELL.But again I say if your looking for a FPS ,this is not a RUN & GUN shooter. Its a stealth game which I found easy to play. But Ive been playing games since BEFORE missle command and pong. So some novice players might get frustrated. Graphics are even better with a ""S"" video cable or better yet a component cable.

I paid full price (maybe more) for this compilation just for Xevious and Super Pac Man alone.. Each is perfectly emulated, and have distinct exhibits in the ""museum"" with digitized images and other paraphenalia from the 80's.

Probably didn't sell as well as it should have 'cause everyone was expecting the MS. to be on it..

Great for the whole family.

5.0	With a cartooninsh twist, this game will satisfy any young star wars fan. All movie plots 1-6 are included in this super fun game. I had great fun running through the Mos Eisley Cantina crowd, into the Hoth war zone, then back through the Cantina into a pod-racer race. This game really allowed me to fully enjoy the Star Wars universe without the dark undertones that woked great for the movies, though with a Lego video game it wouldn't work. I hope that the force will guide all of you to this great and exciting game! Fun For All
5.0	"I wasn't a believer in these ""thumb stick grips"" I was seeing online and more and more people using them. I always thought it was a myth. Then I finally gave in and bought a pair and let me tell you, I can now see why so many people use these! They really work! My aim was MILES better than what it had been. Color could have been a bit more green, but other than that there are no complaints. Buy these today! I'm a believer!"
5.0	Son loves this game !! Five Stars
5.0	"I just got the Elite, I bought it from Amazon, who by the way delivered it in amazing time.

I have a 360 pro that broke on me after only a year...it had the launch chipset, i couldn't turn it in for repairs because I had the case moded. Now, I ordered the Elite and I have to say this unit is by far much better than my old pro. The noise has been taken down a LOT. It barely makes any. Even when the game CD starts spinning,the noise level is very low. The unit does not overheat after hours of playing. I'm more than happy with the Elite. The extra memory capacity is awesome. If you are trying to decided between a Pro and the Elite, go with the Elite. You'll get a bigger HD, HDMI connection for video and audio and the all black look is simply beautiful.

For 100 bucks more you get all of the above without having to spend the extra 180 bucks to upgrade to the bigger HD if you get the Pro.

Buy it from Amazon, their units come with the new Falcon mobo. I hope this helps. Excellent"
5.0	"I have had the HyperX Cloud headset for a little over 3 months now and it's a really nice headset. It is comfortable compared to the previous headsets I have had, although that doesn't mean much when the previous ones have all been trash. The design is great and the build feels like it will last a long time under normal use.

The sound is good. Might be just me but I've already gotten use to using it so it doesn't really sound extraordinary anymore. Microphone, to me anyways, is one of the best I've ever used especially on a headset. It's clear and the mic can be moved closer or away from the mouth or even removed altogether to get just ""headphones."" Cable is long when you put in the extender/volume control in.

For the price I paid, I'm really happy. Out of all the gaming headsets, I think this is the best option. Before you buy, always check for sales on the Cloud II! (Sometimes they are just as cheap as the Cloud Is) Great Gaming Headset"
5.0	Well once again mario does it again. Perfection
5.0	"Graphics - This has the best graphics I have ever seen on thee PSP! While still having an Amazing Framerate! 10/10

Story - The story picks up right after the event of MGS3 and MPO. It answers alot of Unanswered questions as well. 9.5/10

Gameplay - The Gameplay in this game is Amazing! Its so much fun and they have added so many weapons and other stuff it makes it even better! 10/10

Controls - The controls will take some getting used to. But its well worth it and it dosnt take to long at all to warm up to. 8/10

Replay Value - There is so much to do in this game its Crazy! I am still shocked Kojima managed to fit this massive game onto this tiny thing! I would say the story would take about 15-30 hours and to 100% it would easily take 50-60 hours and this is not including CO-OP and Multi player. 10/10

Side Note - You may have heard rumors of this game being to difficult. Well thats a lie this game has challenging bosses but they are so fun even the most aggravated gamers won't brake somthing after dying (LOL!). The bosses will take some practice (I had to retry most of them twice). But its well worth it!

Overall - Overall this game is a masterpiece!! I would recommend it to anybody (Espcially MGS fans)! I would buy a PSP for this one game its that good! So if you haven't gotten this game get it! Overall score 9.9/10 Best PSP game of all time!"
5.0	"This started a great series of PC games, I don't watch the show very much at all, but the games are great!! It is really addicting and you get to love to play the game!! I was reading through the reviews on this game, and people are complaining about the time limit. Well, if you choose the ""Efficincy"" skill it will slow time WAY down to the point where you will be done with the investigation part of the game before like an hour has passed. (in game time, not real time) It has a good storyline, suspicious, annoying, lying characters with secrets to protect, and it is fun to see what suspect you will interrogate next, what lab reports, research of items and people, the survailence unit to tail a suspect, the game is really fun. And when you get into court it is really hard but really fun to play, you don't even have to like the TV show, you will like this game!!! and any other of the two L&O PC games in the series. So Buy It!! Buy Them!! Great First L&O PC Game!!"
5.0	If you liked the game style of Heavy Rain and enjoy horror movies (particularly 90s horror like Scream) it's likely you'll enjoy Until Dawn. It's like an interactive movie and it had multiple endings. I really enjoyed the story and felt there were some unexpected twists. My partner watched me play and guessed a couple events I didn't expect, but I enjoyed playing and she enjoyed watching. The length of game time is relatively short but I didn't feel cheated by that. Replay value is potentially high if you want to see multiple endings and get more trophies. I have played through once and plan to play again because only 3 characters survived my first play through Chilling and entertaining
5.0	"Well I can't say much as I only started playing last night and played for only an hour. So this review I will update as I get further in and will only review my experience so far.

* Graphics are nice, looks clean and reminds me of Uncharted: Golden Abyss. No frame rate issues during fights like other people have had. Limited pop up.
* Sound is as mediocre as everyone has reviewed. I was playing with headphones on and it sounded like I was listening to some one play in the room next to me.
* Controls are fluid and easy. Killing people comes as easy as it ever has in AC and is just as fun.
* Voice acting is great even though the lackluster sound quality sounds like it was recorded into a tin can circa 1930.

So far I haven't had any glitches or game breakers. Granted I downloaded and installed the patch before playing. I don't doubt that people have had the problems they say they have, I just haven't had any problems so far, granted I've only played an hour. I saw one lady on the street walk through a fence in an alley way, but that kind of stuff happens in every game. So it's too soon to say it's the best PS Vita game. I still think Rayman Origins and Uncharted: Golden Abyss are the best handheld games for this system. But being only an hour into Assassins Creed III: Liberation, It is definitely a contender as long as I don't have any problems other people have, i.e. save data corruption and game break glitches. I'll update when I get further in. A good handheld game"
5.0	good game! Five Stars
5.0	"I had Asphalt on the 3DS and thoroughly enjoyed it (in spite of all the flaws that most reviewers complain of). It was natural to me that I get this one as well. While I'm aware that there are mobile phone versions of Asphalt, I don't like using controls with the accelerometer or touch screen with racing games. This game is great because it is similar feature wise and graphically to Asphalt 6 on mobile platforms, but with the comfort of using the analog sticks and buttons of the Vita.

The game has tons of replayability. You get to work your way through a career mode, completing events and objectives so that you may progress or purchase new vehicles. From my recollection there are 100 events to play through (5 across 20 leagues).

There are a bunch of control styles to choose from, including touch, accelerometer, and classic button controls.

I found virtually no flaws with the game. Review"
5.0	This totally worked for me in a windows 8 on apple mac pro laptop and a mac pro tower. I tried it on one Android device with a USB OTG and it didn't work, but I suspect it was the tablet because it the gaming receiver worked every where else. I have used it with three inout devices and have synced wheels and controllers repeatedly and it is very easy and reliable. This totally worked for me!

5.0	"I didn't know what to expect from a lower-priced racing wheel for the PS3 (I've played with one of the wheels that cost in the triple figures at a friend's house and must say that they're really cool and add a lot to racing gameplay). What I was happy about was that this is officially licensed through SCEA as an Official accessory for the PS3. That alone let me know this wouldn't be a disastrous product. Perhaps Sony's involvement in officially licensing this product for their system had some effect on putting a reasonable pricetag on this product because, honestly, the dropoff from higher-priced wheels is not terribly noticeable and certainly should NOT be a dealbreaker.

The one qualm is you really need to make sure you've got the suction cups stuck down as tight as they will go. I've heard complaints that the steering and braking (the unit comes with a separate pedal for that by the way, along with an accelerator pedal) can be a little sensitive but that's essentially due to the game-play designs of the various games which are compatible with this. They are trying to accurately replicate high-speed car handling and driving conditions, hence it will require skill to master your driving techniques. Overall, I have no major complaints and couldn't be happier with owning this product. I can honestly say I do not feel the need to upgrade to a higher-priced racing wheel. Probably only the most hardened racing game enthusiast would pass on this product in favor of one that costs twice as much. Is HORI a trustyworthy manufacturer? Certainly looks that way!"
5.0	tired of putting in sp1 and sp2 all the time this is a lot better frame rates with simulator  without the hassle made for flight simming
5.0	I can understand the hate this game might be getting by some folks. It's bland, it's boring, no multiplayer, blah blah blah.  I remember getting Destiny when it first came out, getting to level 20, and then never touching it again. I just could not commit to what was needed to keep up with everyone. NMS eliminates all the BS and allows you to explore at your own pace and that's why I love it so much. It can become a bit repetitive but that's the hook for me. I land on a planet, and explore away in search of all the resources I need to get to the next. And the fact that I can do it alone without having to team up with 3 overpowered players yelling at me for being a level 50 or whatever keeps me interested.  In real life, I look up at the stars and can only imagine what it would feel like to break through our sky's and be in space. And like I said in title, this game has satisfied that feeling for me. Thank you to Sean Murray and the entire team at Hello Games for this experience! The game that satisfies my idea of space
5.0	Nice like slide in ice! One of the better SHMUP for this system.

5.0	If you bought Infinite Warfare better hurry up and take that garbage to gamestop to get this! Just watch any YouTube videos this is the shooter to buy this year not CoD.
5.0	If you like tenis, you'll love this game. However, you don't have to like tenis either!(Yes its that fun!) This game is as great as Super Smash Brothers. It is addictive and fun as you try and earn different characters and courts to play on. There are about 14-18 different characters to choose from and svereal courts. You have many options of how many games and how tough of an opponnet. I really do recommend this game. Its quite fun, especially if you enjoy tenis. Great Fun

5.0	"Sunset Overdrive to me was the most iffy new IP being released exclusively on Xbox One. Earlier in year Titanfall was set to be Xbox's biggest new exclusive, but it did not meet our expectations. Then attention shifted towards Sunset Overdrive. The game is made by Insomniac who is usually partnered with Sony. However, they took their new game to Microsoft for they felt the game would work better and Microsoft and the Xbox division gave them the opportunity and took a risk on this game. That was a great risk. Sunset Overdrive was a pleasant surprise. I was on the fence, but when I saw the positive reviews I decided to pre-load it on my Xbox. It has been worth the purchase. SSOD has great fluidity. The game runs smoothly at a good fps. The game also looks great graphically with its vibrant colors. The gameplay is excellent with the traversal system. There is also a good selection of wacky weapons like the TNT Teddy and such. Not to mention the character customization is very good. Not as in depth as some games, but the outfits you can wear are nice and wacky.

In a game market bogged with games that are much more seriously tone, story driven, and such SSOD is a breath of fresh air. The game is not serious at all and I wish we could get more games like it today. The game even mentions in game that is just a video game and even makes fun of video game traditions. The game makes fun of the rule of free, and there is one part where you are climbing up two buildings and if you fell off the game would mention how it be pointless to make you climb back up and they would start you where you fell from. I grew up playing the PS2 with classics like Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper, and Ratchet & Clank and Spyro (both of which were made by Insomniac). Sunset Overdrive honestly brings me back to those days. The game just have this old school gameplay type feel to it. It really brings me back to those PS2 days. I hope SSOD can show the gaming industry that the focus does always have to be about adult, dark, gritty, serious, and story driven games. This past generation had so much of that. SSOD feels fresh and thats why I like it. New School Game, Old School Feel"

5.0	I will start out saying this is one of the best controller i have ever seen. There is no lag in the thumb sticks and i got my off eBay kinda used. I have tested this controller on games like; God of war, uncharted, resident evil; metal gear solid, and there is no lag buttons feels great. So this has lag in thumb stick is all false will with mine it is. Plus madcatz have been good to me. I would differently by other one its just as good as the duel stock. One of the best controller

5.0	After seeing a few videos on youtube I decided to purchase this stand. The stand has some weight to it which is a nice touch. It won't be easily knocked off. The controllers slide right in and charge. It also cleans up my tv stand from usb wires connected into my controller. My charging station did come with the U.S. prong connector and has been working fine. The popular charging stand is by Power A which I was originally going to buy. This might cost more due to importing but it was worth every dollar. Might cost more but worth the investment.

5.0	This is a rather interesting innovation by Nintendo, Ive read other peoples review of this product and they were all positive. What I love about this accessory is the fact that you can play Gameboy games on the Gamecube and you can use it with ether a Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Advance SP or a Gameboy Micro or a Gamecube controller. In my case I use a wavebird which is just a personal preference of mine. A friend of mine actually gave it to me, for free. The only thing I had to buy was the disc. Luckily I bought it at local video game store around where I live. I really like this product and I only recommend you get this product if you love Gameboy games otherwise don't bother. I have friends of mine who I know only prefer the console itself. I however love the Gameboy Advance compatibility feature that comes with most Gamecube games and I love this product for the Gamecube. So if you like playing Gamecube and love playing Gameboy games on the Gamecube. Then I highly recommend just playing Gamecube games on the Gamecube. Because sadly the Wii (the one with Gamecube backwards compatibility) does not support Gameboy Advance. Yes you can connect your Gameboy Advance to the Wii depending on the Gamecube game, but Nintendo didn't come out with a product like this for the Wii. I only paid $15.00 for the official Nintendo Gameboy Gamecube start up disc which was complete in a original case with the original manual and disc. While the Wii will recognize the disc unfortunately you won't be able to play Gameboy Advance games on the Wii. Unfortantely it would have been far too complicated to try and make the Wii play Gameboy Games, especially with the way it was designed. Just keep in mind I am talking about the 2006 Wii model not the 2011 Wii model. Gameboy Player / Gamecube attachment

I bought it on the whim and I was happy to find out this was a roleplaying game. The graphics are beatiful the gameplay is challenging and the story is gripping. Worth a playthrough. Great game
5.0	"This game is absolutely addictive to play. The game is definately intense and fast paced, and compared to older TM games is quite a bit more difficult.  I would definately recommend this game as it is alot of fun to play.  Getting the secret characters and levels proves to be a real challenge.  Also, with a about 15 different cars, all with different handeling and physics, there is plenty of reply value here.  Additionally, I love the fact that the levels are interactive and that they can be destroyed or manipulated.

My only complaints about this game is that there is a very steep learning curve.  The game is very fast and the controls are quite difficult to get used to, especially if you play other driving games.  Secondly, it can occasionally get annoying when all of your enemies gang up on you, all the skill in the world won't help you here.

Just as a warning, the game is rated M and is quite a bit darker and more violent than past TM games, which in my opinion makes it far better as I hate when games are dumbed down for kids.

The graphics on this game are great, the levels are impeccably created and designed.  They frequent use of the black/grey/brown color pallets give the atmosphere are dark seedy feel which is awesome.  The music itself isn't bad, I generally tend to keep the music of games pretty low as I am an MVC2 fan and as many of you know the music to that game is an atrocity.

Finally in my experiance, if I am playing more than one game consecutively in a day, I try not to play this one before another driving game.  For instance when I play GTA after playing TM Black, I get bored very quickly as the driving in GTA or Midnight Club is so sluggish compared to TM Black. Twisted Metal Black - Review"

Sure it may be wired and not as fancy pantsy as those new wireless controllers coming out, but it feels so great and everything is so tight feeling.  My friend has a wireless frontman controller and I can barely play using that.  Everything is so loose feeling and I feel like my hands are flailing around all over the neck.  But on this guitar my hands are always where they need to be and never slip.  Overall, this is the best Guitar Hero guitar out there. Best Guitar Hero controller of all (even if its wired)
5.0	"The game Keeps crashing and its buggy for me

UPDATE: The game works great now and it is fun Keeps crashing"
5.0	"I'm on my 3rd playthrough of the game, and let me tell you it is worth it.

***POSSIBLE SPOILER***
You start out defending your ship from an unexpected attack of an unknown enemy. After you die and are brought back the true game begins.
***END SPOILER***

Importing

The game does a great job of keeping track of what you did in the first one, if you import a Shepard. It even lets you remake your character at the beginning, that way new and old players have the same opportunity. The only gripe I have with the import system is that if you import a character who finished ME2 into a new game you don't keep everything like you did in the previous game. You do get to pick a bonus power and get 10 points to max it (or add to any other class powers)at the beginning of the game as well as most if not all of your armor choices, but you only get to keep the Heavy weapons and some of the other weapons that you found in the previous playthrough. I'm not saying that having some of those you don't find until near the end of the first disc are not useful at the beginning. In fact, if you got them at the beginning it would be even better. Instead, after the tutorial mission you are thrown into a mission with just a couple basic weapons. It is after this point that you get the rest of the weapons and any import awards you might have earned.

Replay Value

It would have been nice to only have to get the things you missed the first time around instead of having to buy all the upgrades and do all of the research again. Adding to the replay frustration is the low level cap of 30, reached easily during the first playthrough. This makes replaying it with an existing character pretty pointless because the 25% bonus to XP is wasted, though starting a new game with a new character or an imported one from ME1 takes advantage of that. They should have done what they did in the first game, where you can only reach the highest level if you do a replay. This would have made it more appealing to use the same character on a higher difficulty. As it is, you start with very little and the enemies are scaled up from the beginning. Truly, I died in the tutorial mission a few times on Insanity. Let me tell you, Insanity is well named. If you want the ultimate challenge, it is there for you.

Minigames

There are 3 mini games that can be tedious but not so much that they ruin the game. Hacking is done on computers and other digital devices, you match up little boxes of text that scroll by with the one at the top of the screen. You get 3 chances to match wrong and if you scroll over a red box you go back one step. Bypassing is done on things like safes and doors, it is like a memory game. You run the cursor over every dot and then try to match two of them up. Doors can usually be tried again if you mess up, safes are one try only. The mini game that is used the most often is the resource gathering one. You fly to various planets in the system you land in without a fuel cost, but you have to buy fuel to go between systems in the same cluster. In each system, you use a little targeting reticle to run around the surface of each planet and launch probes when the indicator shows there is something to find. Of course you have to buy the probes too. There are upgrades to make all of the mini games a little easier that you can either buy or find during the course of the game.

Gameplay (AKA You've Got Your FPS In My RPG)

It was a great day when, in ME1, I finally got the armor that would keep me alive longer and the weapon upgrades that made it so I could fire without overheating every few seconds. That is not the case in ME2. All of the weapons, except the Heavy ones that have their own ammo supply (found in boxes), use thermal clips in the style of the FPS where you find ammo on the ground. The armor is a piecemeal affair that consists of whatever you buy or find. Each piece can help you by adding to things like health and shields or, in a few cases, increasing damage from weapons or powers. The most useful additions to your protection or damage come in the form of upgrades. This uses the resources found while probing planets, though some of them can be bought at the various planetary ports you visit. The enemies have vastly improved AI over the previous game, they use cover to their advantage and may even move to avoid an incoming projectile. The AI improves even more as the difficulty increases, at Insanity the enemies will hunt you down behind your cover or stand on higher ground to shoot you over the top of the area you thought you were safe in. Add this to the fact that enemies that are one or two shot kills on Casual take a lot more than that on Insanity and you can see that you really have to work for the victory at such a high difficulty.

The Story

The story continues from where the first game left off and it assumes you chose the darker ending if you start a fresh game without an ME1 character. The dialogue near the beginning covers some of what happened, and there are codex entries for much of the ME1 story, but players who never played the first one might be confused. As you play, you find out that every character has their own past and they ask if you will help them resolve these issues so that they can focus on the mission. Doing so give you a new uniform for them and access to a new power they can use in battles. Though these back stories don't relate to the mission as a whole, they do round out the characters as people. DLC that is available allows Shepard to come to grips with his own past and adds more characters to get to know. There is even one DLC that adds a vehicle for those of you who missed the Mako, this one flies and is a lot easier to use though only for the 5 missions it goes with.

In Conclusion

If you are looking for an FPS with a little bit of story, go for Gears of War. If you are looking for an excellent RPG that has borrowed some FPS elements, this is the game for you. A Little Change Can Be Good"

5.0	"I am an avid PC gamer, so in terms of graphics I have to say that I've seen better. 60 fps is a plus, but I am used to 120hz games ever since switching to a 144hz monitor. One thing that this game blows the other PC games away is the attention to details, may it be the world or the story. It never breaks the immersion of the world it is trying to convey. Voice acting is top notch as well, very enjoyable. This is lacking on 99% of the PC games.
To be honest, my PS4 have been acting as a bluray drive and dedicated streaming device for the last six months. Glad to be finally using it as it is supposed to be used! This game had me considering selling my Xbox 360 due to the fact that I am having more confidence in PS4's upcoming titles. Great game for a great system"
5.0	"Star Wars games have always been great.  And Jedi Knight was one of the first games to use 3d rendered characters.  It was a great game that many people loved and spent many hours on.  JK2 is a great sequel that has brought back the great fun of sabering and hightened everything.
Pros: Sabers!  Great and fluid use of the Quake3 engine.  Incredible Multiplayer fun.
Cons: Weapons almost don't serve a purpose anymore.  The stoyline was good for a while... but the... oh i won't ruin it.
Genre: First Person Shooter.
Gore Level: Low... unless you modify the damage cuased my a saber, no blood.
Bots:  dumb
Ok so here we have one of the greatest games back again for a sequel.  And wow, it is an amazing game.  We have SABERS!! the greatest Melee weapon ever used in a shooter.  And now we have even more ways to use it and it is now a twitchy skill instead of a lucky strike as it was in JK1.  The guns a bigger and badder, but we have SABERS!!!  The enemies are tougher... smarter... but we have SABERS!!! and the maps are larger and cooler... and we have SABERS!!! ok so the saber is definitely the greatest aspect of the game.  PCGAMER- ""The guns are cool...  ...but you'll never go back.""  And honestly i didn't and no one has either.
The game features three modes for battling sabers, medium, light and strong.  Any motion you make with the character affects the way the saber goes.  It can do damage at any point it's on... so running into a friendly with the saber up will do damage.  A plus.  But it doesn't provide a cheap light like it used to in JK1... and there is definitely a few areas where that would have been a lifesaver... literally.  There are also special moves to be done with the sabers, and throw, a better one than any mod and better than MOTS.
And to accomodate the increase in saber use several evil cloaked saber weilding Fallen Jedi appear now and then between herds of Saber fodder (e.g. Stormtroopers and stuff)  You have to get good at the saber too, or else it is all over... and the game just isn't worth it.
Ok the guns are cool too.  We have some returns, repeater, bryar pistol, rifle, bowcaster, thermal detonator... but some new arsenal.  Like a snipper rifle... Concussion Gernades... Missiles with homing and a Flechette.  But all can be blocked and utterly rendered useless with a saber, of course.
The force powers are back with a lot to talk about.  I'll keep it short.  The Jump is now controllable where you kinda of fly to where you want to go and stop.  Kinda nifty... but really weird looking.  Speed in Single player pulls this matrix slow thing and doesn't last as long as it used to... but it's better.  The grip is far more powerful and lightning doesn't cost so much to use anymore.  Healing is progressive and requires you to stop moving to heal over a period of time.  Enhancements make healing eventually instant.  There are many new and great powers to be used in multiplayer too.  Like a combo Lightning, grip and drain.
The Multiplayer is the best element of hte game.  And with q3's engine the Bots are now taking their step into the arena (as opposed to the multiplayer in JK1).  Though they aren't that hard... they do provide everyday fun for slaughter and massacre.  But something that will keep the Gunners happy is that the ability to block a shot with a saber has become a force skill that must be earned.  Yeah... like i found that out the hardway.  Stood head to head with a guy armed with a rifle... me with my patched up flame saber... soon he paniced started backing up and firing at me.  Before i knew it i was respawning... and there are 3 levels to the skill.  Adds a whole new element to the game.  Since the game is on the Q3 engine... expect to see many many mods popping out for it... i've already seen and tested many myself and have found them all to be worht it.  That's what helped make Q3 popular was the easy way to add Mods.
What's best is that i ran a P3 800 with 128mb RAM and managed to kick some serious newbie butt with a fluid and graceful image across my little ole 15"".  Yeah i got a bigger one now (1.8 with 1g RAM) but i can assure you lower end owners and gamers with a budget that it will work on your 600Celeron too.  A 500 is pushing it though.  But does it ever look pretty on a higher end.
Give it a whirl and you'll never go back.  I would recommend maybe upgrading above 56K though...
[ Press SHIFT + `... for the Tilde (~) key.  It brings up the console.  Type in ""helpusobi 1"" to enable editing mode (cheat mode).  Then type ""g_saberrealisticcombat #"" where # is any number.  0 is default.  1 will set the saber damage to a more realistic setting... where it acutally kills in one hit, but you can die too in one hit.  Setting it to 2 will enhance it's damage to high that running into characters kills them.  Going -2 is a good challenege.  Try a game with -20 for fun.  ] On a P3 800... Great game, better Multiplayer"

5.0	"This is a must have for any serious flight simmer.  I had a TrackIR 3 years ago and after trying other ""cheaper"" solutions I ended up buying a new one as the other solutions hogged CPU and just were not as accurate.  It makes a night and day difference in flying in games like War Thunder or the IL-2 series.  Even in older games like FS2_Open it makes a difference. Must have for the flight simmer..."

5.0	"It takes a little bit to get it to work. but I have win7 x64 and I have mouse control capability and everything. To me this game is great. Better than modern games really. The levels are huge!! and there are A LOT OF ENEMIES in every map. It always reminded me of Doom with  a twist of South park on the turok 2 engine. Don't see why it was so hated on other than frame rate for the n64. DOOM+SOUTPARK+TUROK2ENGINE= A nice game to play when you are totally drunk! How could it get any better?

Again though I got it to work on win7 x64 so if any one has questions about how to get it to work or how something doesnt work like mouse input let me know. ill try to help! GTX 780 i7 4770k. so if it works on my system it should work on yours ONE OF THE UNDERRATED GEMS OF THE 90's"
5.0	If you want hours and hours of entertaining gaming with easy drop-in multiplayer, loads of fun areas to explore, an intriguing storyline with plot twists, and countless weapons, character skills, and customizations, look no further. Oh and there are tons of easter eggs, side quests, and now DLC as well. I got this on sale for $28 and have already played it for 52 hours and still haven't completed the main storyline yet, let alone playthrough 2 and different character classes. Just an amazing game! Excellent game
5.0	Great product and design. Five Stars
5.0	Good value when I purchased it.  Love the game.  The plastic binding of the case is weak and cracks easily so keep the outer pouch to keep it together. Good value when I purchased it
5.0	Star Wars Jedi Academy is a lot of fun.  I found myself unable to turn off my computer until I finished playing it.  I completed Jedi Academy in a little over a week, playing about 2 hours per day on the average.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Star Wars.  There is nothing like wielding a lightsaber and fighting dark jedi.  I found that I rarely used the first person mode with a gun/blaster.  The lightsaber was too much fun!! Love Jedi Knight
5.0	was bought for my BF he said they were good and he liked them very much so if he was happy with them so am I good game
5.0	Fun Five Stars
5.0	the vitas thumbsticks are way too shallow to enjoy gaming. these fix that issue. i don't have a problem hitting the X button, it took all of 10 minutes to get used to. the sticks are a little pricey but it is worth it. they won't come off easily but honestly going back to a friends vita without them was terrible; i don't think you'd want to take them off. just what my vita needed
5.0	Looks and works great Five Stars
5.0	"Cherry MX switches, colored contoured WASD key replacements (comes with a set of a few extra colored ones like QERF as well which I don't use and a key puller to remove the keys), and awesome configuration software equals a really sweet keyboard. I actually already own a Vengeance K70 I bought awhile back to improve my gaming (and because non mechanical keyboards seem to break often enough to warrant it). I'd say this keyboard easily stands right up next to it. I do miss the ability to control the volume that the Vengeance has though but aside from that I'd go with either without much thought. I must say it's a much slicker looking keyboard than the Vengeance due to the way they handle the LEDs for the Capslock, etc. though.

The really cool thing about this keyboard is the configuration software. You can change the backlit coloring to be static and stay on for a certain set of keys or you can have it be animated or respond to actions. My wife loves the effect where if she hits a key it'll pulsate the coloring through the rest of the keyboard. There's also a matrix-esc rain effect where the keys drip down color at random times. It's all really silly and I'll only ever use the fully lit mode but it definitely is a cool little feature to have.

The only downside to this keyboard really is the lack of an arm bar included with it. The Vengeance K70 has one and I often am very grateful for it in regards to how I feel after long gaming sessions. I feel like I'm lifting my hands a bit more up to compensate with this one to avoid any long term wrist pain but it may just be me being overly cautious considering I've always used one with it. Not as relaxing given my setup but others may not care.

Either way you can't go wrong with a corsair mechanical keyboard. These feel well put together and built to last. No complaints at all here. I've owned expensive LG keyboards with all the bells and whistles before -- these corsair doesn't need bells and whistles they build solid high performing keyboards. I think they're converting me into some sort of keyboard fanboy so I best leave it at that. An awesome mechanical keyboard to compliment any gamers arsenal"

5.0	One of my daughter's favorite Wii games.  She has 3 of the Just Dance games so far.  Fun and great exercise! Daughter loves it
5.0	Nintendo does it again. Splatoon is the Mario Kart of first person shooters. The 8 player Turf Wars are short, chaotic and addictive. Your squid character must cover the game surface with as much ink as possible, while hunting down enemy players and splatting them with your ink weapon, sending them back to the starting point. It's a free for all melee that recalls why other Nintendo classics, like Super Smash Brothers and Mario Kart are so much fun. Online play is seemless and easy. Graphics are vibrant and colorful and the art style is classic Nintendo. There is quite a bit of DLC available for this title as well. This will become another classic Nintendo franchise. Nintendo creates another classic
5.0	fun! Five Stars
5.0	"Final Fantasy IX is my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time! It's also my favorite video game of all time. When I played Final Fantasy X, I thought that it was the best Final Fantasy. For a few months, I believed that Final Fantasy X was the best because of how good the graphics, storyline and voice acting was. Then I played Final Fantasy VII and loved it more than any game ever. I always thought I'd love Final Fantasy VII the most. Then I played Final Fantasy VIII and it was then my second favorite Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy VII was still my favorite Final Fantasy. Then I wanted to try out Final Fantasy IX and heard mixed thoughts about it. I decided to try out my friend's game and from the opening FMV I really liked it. Then I decided to buy my own copy. It wasn't until my third game of Final Fantasy IX that I realized that I love Final Fantasy IX more than anything. Even Final Fantasy VII, which is now almost tied with Final Fantasy IX. After playing my third game of IX, I did start a fourth game and more and have played just about every Final Fantasy I THROUGH X-2, Final Fantasy XII-XIII, Tactics, Crystal Chronicles but IX will always be my favorite. Well here is why it's my favorite game of all time.

Gameplay: 10/10

The gameplay for Final Fantasy IX is my favorite out of all the Final Fantasy games I've played. It's a very cool system that I think is the best in the series. Every character is unique because not one character can learn the same ability. Everyone is different and that's one reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite. There are basic abilities like auto-haste that everyone can learn but everyone has their own special abilities. Zidane is a thief and he can only have the steal and master thief ability. Garnet and Eiko are summoners and white mages but the summons are completely different and only a few of the white magic spells are different. Vivi is a black mage and he is the only one who can learn black magic. Quina is the only one who can learn blue magic, Amarant is the only one who can throw items and weapons, Freya is a dragon knight and has these cool dragon knight skills, Steiner is a Knight and he has a very unique and cool purpose when in the party with Vivi. Steiner can use magic sword. That means that when you command Steiner to use something like Fire Sword, Vivi will cast Fire on Steiner's sword so when Steiner goes to attack the enemy not only will he deal great damage with the sword, but also will deal fire damage. Steiner also has very unique sword abilities. In Final Fantasy IX, the characters learn abilities through equipment. You equip up to five different pieces of equipment and they have abilities that the characters can learn. In battle you gain experience points and Ability Points. Once a character has learned an ability, you can change their equipment to learn another ability and you'll keep the previous ability regardless what equipment you have on. The way you equip abilities is you get these blue stones which is limited by the characters level and every character has a different number of stones. This makes it so that you can't have every single ability equiped at once. As the characters' levels go up so does the number of stones which makes it possible to have more abilities equiped.

Also, the number of characters in battle has been brought back up to four. In battle, there is a wait bar that fills up and when it is filled, that character can take a turn. There is also a limit break system called Trance. A bar under the characters' wait bar fills up a little more each time the character gets hit. Every character has a different trance ability. Trance is a characters' devastating attack. There is also an ability to make the character go into Trance faster.

Another part of the gameplay is there is a ! symbol that pops above the characters' head whenever you find some treasure. You can have a curser appear whenever you enter a place but that can be turned off in the config menu.

Something that not alot of people know about is that two people can actually play this game. In the config menu, there is an option to having which characters' are controlled by which player. Two player is only used in battle. If controller one is set for a certain character then controller two is set for another character, only the person who is using that certain controller can use that character. There is no way one person can level up and the other person visit towns at the same time but it's still a unique feature of Final Fantasy IX that I didn't know about until my third game.

One more thing about the gameplay that's different from most Final Fantasy's. When Garnet or Eiko summons for the first time, you will see the full summon animation. After the first time only the full animation will be at random times. The only way to see a full animation all the time is to use the boost ability. But I usually have boost because I like watching the whole animation. Also, the shorter animation deals less damage.

Story: 10/10

The main reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite. The story is most interesting story i've ever seen in a video game. From the very beginning FMV to the end credits, the whole story is incredible. Never once was I bored with the storyline or leveling up. I have spent 13 or 14 hours at a time playing Final Fantasy IX because the story is so amazing and interesting. You have Zidane who is a thief and he's the main character of the game. Then you have Garnet who is a princess and she is also a summoner. Eiko is a young summoner. Vivi is a young black mage. Steiner is a Knight. Quina is a blue mage. Amarant is this fighter. Freya is a dragon knight. I'm not going to say a whole lot about the story because I don't want to ruin the game for anyone but I will say that this is most deepest, in-depth, engrossing game i've ever played. There are castles. There are dragons. There are Kings and Queens. There are chocobos. There are tons and tons of moogles that say Kupo! There is no voice acting in this game but Zidane, the main character, has more character depth, personality and character development than any other Final Fantasy's main character. I have seen so many different emotions throughout Final Fantasy IX than any other Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy IX is the most humorous game that i've ever played. I find myself laughing throughout at least 70 or 80 percent of the game. The characters in the party and even the NPC's are the most interesting and most funny that i've ever seen. People that say you need voice acting for more depth is wrong. Because I have played Final Fantasy IX four times now and have actually seen more in IX than any of the other Final Fantasy's. The story keeps you hooked from beginning to end. There were times where I just didn't sleep because I couldn't put down the controller. I totally love the story and it will always be my favorite of all time!

Sound: 10/10

The sound and music of the game is also the best i've ever heard in a Final Fantasy game. When a character attacks, you can hear the attack. Also magic and summons are very well done. I love the sound effects of the water, wind, lava, just everything you can think of has sound and it's amazing. This music in this game is the best music i've ever heard because not one track is ever out of place. You never go to an area and feel the music shouldn't be there. In fact, just about every area, cut scene, FMV has a different piece of music that some tracks you only once in the game. There were so many musical tracks for this game that they had to make five discs instead of just a four disc soundtrack. Because the four just has the basic music in the game but the fifth disc the FMV music. Nobuo Uematsu really put alot of effort into the music of Final Fantasy IX and it shows greatly. I love every piece of music in Final Fantasy IX and never get bored of it. The music totally fits the game perfectly. My favorite piece is ""You're Not Alone"" which is played near the end of the game and it's a powerful track when Zidane is feeling completely worthless.  ""Rose Of May"" is another favorite, it's so beautiful.  They even have a bunch of different chocobo songs. The same song just the tempo is different for each one. Even the music in Black Mage Village is a variant of the chocobo theme.  Awesome soundtrack! Also the moogles make a really cute sound.

Graphics: 10/10

The graphics for Final Fantasy IX is the best i've ever seen in a playstation game. The environments are so realistic looking that it's incredible. There are many places where you see water flowing and it's so smooth looking. The characters are also done awesome graphically. You can see alot of detail in the characters such as eyes blinking, the moogles pom-pom thing on their heads moving effortlessly, the way the camera will change to focus on a single character when it's their turn and of course the FMV's. The FMV's are the best FMV's i've ever seen. The way Vivi looks in the FMV's, you'd think he was real. You'd also think the moogles are real because if you really pay close attention you can see fur. I love the graphics of Final Fantasy IX.

One other thing about the graphics: The world map is the most incredible looking world map. There are castles which of course look cool from the inside but when you go out on the world map, you can see the castles perfectly. The castles look amazing from the world map. There is also a couple places with waterfalls and to just take a second to watch the waterfalls, the views are breathtaking. I'm not kidding. The world map is more than just a place to walk on, travel, ride chocobos. It's pure beauty. I love going out on the world map. The forests and mountains are also amazing. You can definitely tell that Squaresoft put tons and tons of effort into this game.

Side Quests: 10/10

Final Fantasy IX has got to be the game with the best side quests. I have found myself spending over 50 hours just doing sidequests and they are so fun and addicting. My all time personal favorite sidequest is the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. Not only do you get to ride a chocobo all over the world map but you get to play a treasure hunting game. There are a few different locations where you search in an area for treasure. Also you get to find treasure on the actual world map. And don't worry, you get pictures and hints so you're not running all over the world map trying to find a specific treasure for hours on end. There are tons of treasures including ultimate weapons to find in this amazing sidequest. AND, in this amazing game, the chocobos can get to actually fly!!  Yes, you get a flying ability and it really makes this game so unique because of this alone, let alone everything else.  There is also a really cool frog catching game, a jumprope game for Vivi and Eiko, a really fun and cool card game called Tetra Master which is alot more fun and easier to get the hang of than the card game of Final Fantasy VIII. There is also a coin sidequest which you get some cool items which one of them is needed to get an item for Final Fantasy IX's second ending. Yes Final Fantasy IX has two different endings. I love the sidequests. There are more than I listed but those are the best. Another reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite.

Good points:

Awesome, funny, deep, very in-depth storyline
Awesome Graphics
Incredible music and sound
Fun sidequests
amazing, most developing characters
Very cool gameplay

Bad Points:

Nothing

Overall: 10/10

I know what you're thinking. You're wondering what is bad about the game. To be totally honest, I find nothing bad about the game at all. To me, it's perfection. To me, it's what Final Fantasy is supposed to be and whenever I think of Final Fantasy, I think of Final Fantasy IX. If I had to pick one Final Fantasy that was a true Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy IX would be it. Final Fantasy IX has everything I could possibly want out of a game. The way I feel about this game is like no other game. It's like Squaresoft made Final Fantasy IX just for me because there's not one thing in the game that I don't like. I love everything about it. To me, it's the perfect game.

Rent/Buy: Buy

Buy this game right away if you don't have it and play it if you do have it and just haven't played it yet. Trust me, you will not regret it. This game is a must have for any Final Fantasy fan. If you love the old-school Final Fantasy's then you'll love this and if you are not really into old-school, this game is sure to change your mind. Please go out and buy this game. It will be the best buy you've ever made!

Replay Value: Very High

What I am about to tell you is very important so please, please take my advice. I have played Final Fantasy IX four times now and have realized a very important element that's not really been used before in Final Fantasy. I decided to use different characters for different party's, situations in my third game and seen something very exciting. The dialog changed. For instance, when I used a character the guide suggested, certain dialog came up. When on my third game, I decided to use different characters for the situations and found that I got more story than just using the same characters for some of the situations. And you'll know in the game when they ask you to pick a certain party. Also since this game has two endings it's definitely worth replaying.

The number one reason I am stressing to play this game multiple times is I didn't find out alot of a characters' past until I replayed the game and I was on my third game. Trust me people, play this game at least four or five times. You always find out more in a replay game. And you understand more and more each time you play. I know this from experience. The only way to fully experience everything and get the most story is to play Final Fantasy IX multiple times and for me I love the game so i'll probably end up playing it as long as I can for years to come. Bottom Line: Best Game Ever!!! Thank you Squaresoft!! You've outdone yourselves. ""I want mail kupo!"""
5.0	Good product, fast delivery. Five Stars
5.0	"I really am enjoying this game. I can not wait to see what else Blizzard is going to release as content! At first I thought the skill system was going to bother me. After hours upon hours testing out the different skills and passive ability combinations I can see I was wrong. While it seems simpler to me than the skills trees in Diablo 2 it does seem to increase experimentation and is more forgiving being able to re spec at any time (with a cooldown if you are not in town) it is still enjoyable out of the sheer combination of abilities you can try. I did find a good set that I enjoy sticking with for the Inferno difficulty that seems to serve me well, but I have talked to others and seen others that work which is great to know that more than one set works. I love not being locked out of every other ability because I chose a specific tree to master in.

Since I just talked about skills let's talk about stats... Each class has a certain stat that will increase damage and do one other thing for all classes (each point of strength increases a barbarians damage by 1%, but gives 1 point of armor to every class). There are no stat points to enter in the game as you level. This took out part of the ""this is my character and I choose how to specialize him"" type of feeling somewhat for me, but really it didn't bother me after a bit since the way the stats are made it wouldn't seem to fit for me. Gear has the possibility to have stat points or other (many other) properties on it. You can also socket gear with stat points to help lean yourself toward a stronger, more aggressive build, or a tankier, sturdier hero. I think this is a good approach... But it also makes me sad because I miss things like runewords and currently I don't see any way to implement them without changing how many sockets are on items (max of 3 I believe). The gems seem a bit bland as well, doing what I feel are somewhat generic things and being so few different types. There are many levels to each particular gem a few that are found, all that can be crafted towards, and plans to help you make even better quality gems! This, for me, helps makes up for it :).

Ah the auction house, gold and real money. Some hate it, some love it. I'm part of the latter (big surprise by now I'm sure I bet I'm being called a fanboy by some already :) ). I was.... Ok at trading in D2. I was bad at remembering prices of items or seeing what things were worth after a shift in price. This generally got me screwed. This auction house system keeps everything simple for me. Stuff is worth gold and gold is worth stuff. The real money auction house (RMAH) seems to cuz a massive amount of controversy. People are saying blizzard has modified drop rates around the AH. I have seen them say they did not, but whether you believe that is up to you! I have made a few dollars in the RMAH and if people want to spend money... well thats ok with me. I personally don't plan on spending money but hey if you wanna look at it differently than paying money for fake items just think of it as something like the subscription fee for WoW ;). All I can say is if you don't like the AH or RMAH system then just don't use it. I don't see Blizzard taking it out and it is not required to play the game regardless of what some people think its the only way to get good gear... Someone had to find it so maybe you can too if you are lucky enough!

The game progresses steadily difficulty wise... And then Inferno difficulty is rough on all comers. This I am also glad for. I love the challenge. I did not want a game I personally could blaze through each difficulty with little to no farming for some gear. I'm not saying I never get frustrated, but to me that's part of the experience. The frustration results in me knowing I could beat it if I would have assaulted a bit smarter or maybe had upgraded this piece of gear.... So I do whatever needs to be done and next time I encounter a similar enemy I rub it in its face when I demolish him :). If you do not want a game that requires you to hunt or back track and repeat runs to get better items to progress then this isn't for you. If you have no issue not being able to thrash the hardest difficulty or enjoy the gearing up of video games such as this then I believe you will enjoy it like me.

The crafting to me seems pretty useless at earlier levels and good at later levels (I've crafted a few nice things but most of it is found) but I like how it is handled. Creating items does not increase the blacksmith/jewelcrafters rank. It is done separately using gold and pages/books/tomes when in the higher levels. You can also find plans to craft. I have found a few but not many. There are some set/legendary plans as well.

The monsters are enjoyable to fight! Not only do they have the normal monsters that are massacred with ease but they have stronger ones as well. I like fighting the champion or unique monsters with all of their special affixes to give them some bonus powers. Not only does it keep it interesting to see what I am fighting next or how I may need to employ my various chosen abilities to overcome the obstacle but it is also an efficient way to find new gear upgrades!

Speaking of the champion/unique monsters when you reach level 60 (the level cap) you begin to receive a stacking (up to 5) buff called Nephalem Valor when you or another member kills a champion/unique monster. This buff increases your magic and gold find. To me this helped alleviate some of the repetitive nature of running straight through to bosses (don't get me wrong boss runs were fun for me in D2 but I am glad I can experience more of the game and still complete my other goal). The bosses do still play a key roll, however. When you reach the maximum stacks of Nephalem Valor and then killing a boss you are guaranteed a rare item and a few magic items. One tricky thing is once you begin to get Nephalem Valor changing out your skills will cause you to lose all stacks. This doesn't bother me as I said earlier I have found a decent build to use.

The level cap of the game being 60 struck me as odd. Not a good or bad thing for me since the highest I made in D2 was 88. I guess Blizzard wanted people to feel they made it to the end game faster? I did enjoy the feeling of unlocking a new ability, rune, or passive every level instead of just grinding 3 levels to get something new. even If I ended up not using that new thing I got for a long time I'm still glad I got to play and experiment with it. I generally play with 2-3 friends so the games allowing 4 people work out very well for us. While I do play alone as well I feel the game scales pretty well based on how many people are in it. I do not miss the 8 player cap.

One thing I can't really comment on is the chat/channel system. I do not really use it except to talk with friends and it works well enough for that. I wish I could make the font bigger though.

SomethingI didn't particularly enjoy (but also didn't hate) was the actual story. This personally didn't bother me much since I am in it for the actual monster slaying and loot so while I did watch every scene it didn't really captivated me.

Overall I have found no glaring problems that ruin the game for me. I am certain I missed a lot of key issues and parts to the game that others may want to hear about or talk about and I may try to add more as I delve into the game or if new content is released (can't wait). Obviously there were some server problems and maintenance issues for a while, but who really did not expect that for the first week or two?

Well that's my review. I apologize if anything is misspelled or doesn't seem clear... I tried to type this out, ran out of time, then picked it up again later after being awake for 21 hours so I'm a wee bit tired. If you get irrationally angry at something you disagree with try re reading it starting it with ""in my opinion"" since this is all based off my play experience/likes/wants/etc. Also sorry if anything I stated is blatantly wrong. Game is still pretty new. In the end I loved D2 to death and I will love this game for different reasons... But love them both I do! If you wanted a new D2, this isn't it but if you like killing stuff, finding stuff, and doin stuff you might enjoy this game like me! I do not expect or believe everyone should love/hate this game based on what I have stated or because they loved/hated D2. I will continue to play this game and attempt to beat Inferno on multiple characters and even possibly hardcore mode. I am excited for new content and have high hopes :). Loving the game"
5.0	What more can I say on this one...  If you have wii / wii u you need it...  It's black so it's cool...  And it's original so buy it...  Buy it from Amazon too cause it's cheaper :) It's a controller

5.0	grandson likes this game Five Stars
5.0	This is a cool version of Street Fighter. Awesome to play! Five Stars
5.0	Exactly what you expect, a Wii remote plus.  The remote is nice for games that utilize the sensor (wii sports, dance games).  We personally have moved to the advanced controller for day to day playing, but these work great for games that use the sensor Great for games that use the sensor!
5.0	One of the best games for the PS2 along with Dark Cloud 2, Rogue Galaxy. Level-5 make some of the best games IMO. Dungeon crawling, town building placement, weapon synthesizing fun for the whole family.
5.0	This is a great. Five Stars
5.0	Turtle Beach's Ear Force Z11 is a very high quality gaming headset. I purchased this for $31.00, and I'm telling anyone reading this - it is worth well more than that. The quality of this headset is unmatched even at higher price levels. The earphones comfortably fit over your ears, and help to block out ambient sounds. The speakers in the headphones are superb quality, allowing for high quality music enjoyment as well as incredible immersion into various gaming atmospheres. The microphone has a high quality mechanical pivot which I would find hard to break, and the microphone itself can be contorted to your own specified shape. The main headphone jack works with smartphones or certain computer models that have the singular port for both audio and microphone, but it also comes with an adapter to split it to audio and microphone separately. If you're doing any gaming, online or offline, I would suggest you buy this headset, as it greatly adds to the gaming experience. Amazing headset
5.0	Mirror's Edge - Xbox 360  ANOTHER GAME FOR 25 YEAR OLD SON. LEAVING FEEDBACK FOR HIM AND HE RECOMMENDS THIS GAME FOR ALL GAMERS WHO ARE INTO SERIOUS ACTION AND INTERPLAY. ACTION PACKEDC
5.0	I just have to say that this is the best racing/jet ski game EVER. It has GREAT graphics and so many things you can choose from. You can unlock different races, wetsuits, jet-skis, and teammates. You can customize your music to suit YOUR mood. The water is realistic and the races are fun in any mode! This is a must have for ALL X-Box Owners! Splish Splash...SPLASHDOWN!
5.0	Beta player here. This game is actually pretty good and if you like Borderlands I'd say just get it so that way we can support Gearbox for Borderlands 3 haha but if you don't want to spend 60 bucks then wait until it's about 40 Actually a good game
5.0	This is a great game the whole family can enjoy.  There are song choices for the youngest children (The Wiggles), teens, and even mom and dad.  All of the choices are family friendly, and if you take turns picking songs, you can get the entire family involved.  This would also be a good gift for a child you're not quite sure where they are in age, too old for little kid stuff but too young for teenager stuff or you're not sure?  There will be something in here they'll like.  We ended up with everyone from grandma down to my littlest dancing and having a great time. Choices for The Whole Family
5.0	(enter review here) Five Stars
5.0	They really made this game look a lot better for his system. It's like they went back and truly added more detail to everything from the mouth movements to the facial details/expressions. They even changed a few bits of the game but not in a bad way, everything that happened is the same but they made certain scenes more dramatized. For instance, in the beginning cutscene when Marcus is in jail (this is not a spoiler btw), the wretches are now attacking the cage Marcus is in violently to get him rather than the original Gears where they are seen just running along the top. This game also came with campaign maps that were not included in the 360 version. Really happy to play this again, one of the best shooters ever made!! More than just an HD
5.0	love it Five Stars
5.0	The PS Vita's pretty terrible without triggers. Adding handles and protection at the same time? No brainer. Gotta get one of these if you want to have a handheld worth using. Makes the PS Vita Bearable, Great Even
5.0	good Five Stars

5.0	Naughty Dog has done it again and made one of the greatest video games ever made. It took me forever to finish, not because I kept dying and having to restart checkpoints but because I wanted to explore every gorgeous nook and cranny. Just when I thought an area was the most beautiful and couldn't be topped, I advanced to a new chapter that was even better looking than the last. Gunfights were a ton of fun as was sneaking though the grass or diving under water to get to places to stealth takedown your foes. I was so sad when the game ended, something I didn't expect, because it was an emotional roller coaster and because I really wanted these places to exist. Fortunately I get to relive them by staring what will surely be my second of many playthroughs. If you like to play video games, you need to play Uncharted 4. The best game I've played since The Last of Us. Simply a masterpiece.
5.0	"I would call this the best Lego game ever made, except that I really like Lego LOTR's hub world.  This game has great fun, creativity, music, variety, characters, and levels.  It is without a doubt the COMPLETE Indy experience, covering everything from the trilogy (I am not a Crystal Skull fan).  You can relive every fun moment with every character I could imagine from the movies.  It's comedy fun tromping around with oddball combinations of characters.  My kids (and I) laugh with glee taking Sallah and his shovel and smacking Lego Nazis into little piles of Lego coins.  It makes effective use of the great John Williams score, and will even teach you to distinguish between the scores of the three movies--which are each great in their own way.  Lastly, Indy's workplace, Barnett College, is the ""hub world"" from which you move between levels, view your treasures, and so on.  I have played through to 100% completion twice, and I don't think I've encountered a single glitch or bug.  Every time I play it, it puts a smile on my face.  Highest recommendation for kids and adults alike. Perfect"
5.0	"There's a movement in gaming recently that tries to push ""disturbing subject matter"" with a bland array of dull colors and graphics meant to incite a sense of gritty realism. This has gone on so long we may have forgotten a game can have bright lush surroundings and  flamboyant cartoon-like characters while still addressing deeper mature issues.

First an foremost Alice: Madness returns is an old school plat former. In the vein of titles such as Mario 64, and  Kameo you will do a lot of jumping, sliding, lever pulling, and even shrinking to traverse areas that are a little larger than those found in more straightforward action romps such as Lollipop Chainsaw. If you get queasy  around pitfalls and high  heights Alice: Madness returns will definitely pour on the pressure and elevate your pulse!  The game's effortless ability to induce a sense of panicky vertigo is admirable though there were moments I thought certain scenarios with their unforgiving relentless barrage of fast moving and disappearing floating foot-rests dragged on to the point of excess tedium.

The enemies in A:MR are not pushovers either. Running in hacking & slashing will get you killed often. Whether you are fighting giant cannon totting crabs, armored zombie card solders, samurai wasps, spectral sailors, giant dollies, or hulking fireball tossing gooey tar abominations adorned with multiple porcelain baby heads , chances are you will have to stun them or knock them over with one weapon before finishing them off with another.

Luckily A:MR gives you plenty of destructive implements. The hobby horse is akin to a heavy mace. It can stun enemies and break through weakened obstructions. The pepper grinder is a machine gun. ""Rabbit bombs"" explode when prompted to by a stop watch. Likewise they can temporarily be applied on weight sensitive tiles to buy Alice precious seconds to traverse her terrain. The vorpal blade is a fast moving knife and the tea kettle packs the punch of a makeshift grenade launcher. All these can be upgraded with teeth you find throughout your journey.

It's true the first Alice game had more weapons but the sequel makes up for it with a few nice added incentives. Alice can now break down into butterflies and blur in any direction to evade attacks. She can shrink in order to travel through small key-holes or to see details her big-self would otherwise miss. Additionally Alice has nice double jump and float maneuvers to make the plat forming just a tad less hectic. If you're still not ""sold"" there's also ""hysteria mode"" that transforms Alice into a creepier version of the white-queen when her health is low. Attacks do more damage during this burst of adrenaline and psychotic rage but Alice's hysteria gauge will tick down swiftly to prevent confrontations from becoming a complete cakewalk.

Of course next up are the graphics. Let me get something off my chest right now. A little abrupt pop in texturing never bothered me much.  It's no secret the Unreal 3 engine has issues with this sort of thing but when everything is so beautiful to look at as it is in A: MR I could care less. Each area has a theme and they all ""shift"" between whimsical and nostalgic to macabre and psychologically twisted. It's ironic A:MR surprised me more with its' environmental transitions than the latest Silent Hill games. I could rarely predict ""when"" the world around me would suddenly flip upside down. Whoever scripted these events that gradually descended into complete insanity and pandemonium should be applauded!

A gripe some people may have is a lack of boss battles up until the very end of the game. However, for me the problem is we ""expect"" these over-the-top encounters and because of this it breaks the immersion. At least for me each place in wonderland  was more unpredictable and more suspenseful because it lacked the usual hulking monstrosities guarding each exit point to the next stage. The only certainties we have are there will be more monsters to fight and more puzzles to solve. Beyond that we're very much left in the dark and we are completely clueless as to ""when"" a chapter will officially wrap itself up. This lent itself to the ""horror atmosphere"" of A:MR quite nicely. Whether or not it was a deliberate design choice or was due to lack of funding is anyone's guess.

The music is fantastic! Each track varies to fit the mood of each place ant there's a nice range amongst creepy industrial compositions, melancholy oriental tunes, and fittingly sinister violin pieces. The composer reminds me a bit of Akira Yamaoka and I mean that in the most flattering way imaginable!

However, there are a few qualms that pop up. First of all, A:MR is rife with puzzles and mini games. While most of these can be skipped there are certain ones that cannot. In truth many of these diversions are refreshingly artistic with old-school arcade conventions! The problem is not that they exist but rather how often certain ones are repeated. It gets to the point they feel like padding as opposed to well thought out side quests.

Secondly, both the camera and some extra tough plat-forming segments will conspire against the fun you're having. Neither quibble is so blatantly bad it leaves the game broken but they are noticeable all the same.

In the end I found Alice's return to wonderland to be an adventure worth undertaking. Much of the story continues the events of its' predecessor but because it's supposed to be a mystery my lips are sealed! If you're tired of military fpses, macho brochismo derp-a-herping, and soulless dungeon loot acquisition, A:MR may refresh that retro-gamer part of your inner psyche which has been neglected far too long!

Pros

+ Many secrets to find

+ Game plus mode

+Compelling story with a mystery thriller slant to it

+ Adult material handled with tasteful subtlety

+ Gorgeous sprawling areas with imaginative scenery

+ Fantastic sound track

+ Enemies require strategy to beat

+ Challenging enough to give you a sense of accomplishment after you see the credits roll

+ First Alice game included as a free download if you buy Maness Returns brand new.

+ Inexpensive dlc that's actually helpful

+Alice has good motivations as a protagonist and her cause is a noble one worth fighting for

+It's delightful to stomp around the Red Queen's domain as ""Godzilla Alice"".

Cons

-Certain mini games are repeated too many times

-Sometimes the camera goes wonky and makes a few platforming segments and a few battles more frustrating than they should be

- Other gamers maybe distraught there's only one actual boss in the whole game

-Play each chapter after an extensive cool-down break lest you end up punching your controller and shouting obscenities at your television screen

-Texture blur and texture pop-in issues rear their ugly heads

- The lock-on targeting feature is easy to understand but difficult to master

For you if: If you're a psychology buff who loves things laid out to you in fanciful metaphor you'll adore A:MR. Likewise if you count Psychonauts, Kameo, Mario 64, and Silent Hill amongst your favorite games then A:MR should find its' way to your collection as soon as possible! A:MR is also for the old-school-fools  who yearn for a challenge and who like to be rewarded for exploring off the beaten path!

Not for you if: If you're afraid of heights, prefer slaying enemies over jumping around on moving platforms,  get nauseated upon being exposed to re-imaginings of famous literature, and think Lewis Carroll was a talentless hack you should steer clear of this one! Admittedly A:MR is also on the grim and serious side so if you want a gaming experience with a sense of humor you will not find any ""comedy gold"" here. Certain people may also be offended by the content in A:MR. There are suggestive themes centered around brainwashing, prostitution, rape, and child slave labor.

Closing thoughts

At a further date I'd like to research on why we are so enamored with completely vilifying the Victorian era. Even self professed fans of this era always portray it as a grim hopeless place rife with classicism, misogyny, dirty back allies, serial killers, rapists, pedophiles, children slave labor, witch hunts, repressed sexuality, courtroom corruption, and billowing dark smoke spewing forth from monstrous trains and industrial factories.  While I'm sure Victorian England had these problems to some degree it seems to be we only focus on that negative side of the equation. Heck, if I were to dwell only on modern society's ""bad qualities"" we'd be very much ""Neo-Victorian"" according to the works of Tim Burton and Zack Snyder.

However, one thing I like about Alice:MR is it's not steeped in complete pessimism, cynicism, and nihilism. Unlike say ""Sucker Punch"" that tries to pass itself off as female empowerment yet has a ""wtf ending"" that completely contradicts with its` initially positive message, Alice's conclusion is one that is satisfactory where true justice prevails. Unlike Tim Burton's recent tamer-than-expected trip back to Wonderland McGee's version isn't afraid to hold back nor does it pull any punches. (Though admittedly I enjoyed Burton's Through The Looking Glass adaptation for what it was. We all knew going into the theatres Disney wasn't going to let the man make it rated ""R"". )

It's also refreshing Alice can lay down the hurt in attire that's a touch more modest and befitting than a string bikini or a burlesque gothic Lolita outfit that`s two sizes too small. While I'm not against sexy titillation and I do not get morally outraged by its' presence , I do respect game developers who manage to make their leading heroine ""pretty"" without showing off excess amounts of her skin.

When it comes to steam-punk Victorian fiction American McGee and Spicy horse really nailed it for me. I'd love to see Alice get a third game in her series! Hopefully the sales figures for A:MR were not completely abysmal! One of the better adventure platformers out of this generation!"
5.0	"Simple fact, the VMU was the best memory card ever made. And, chances are, it always will be. With it's own screen you could see in the controller while playing, it often gave you extra information or mini-games you couldn't get elsewhere. Played cool animations while you were playing, and mostly just sat there and looked cool.

If you managed to get a battery for it, you could even play some extra mini-games after you pulled the thing out of your controller. It was like it's own little mini-gameboy getting stuck into your controller. It's just too bad game designers decided to go back to the boring old flat memory cards after the dreamcast died. The best memory card ever"
5.0	"I Platinumed the first Prototype and immediately trade it in for less than $5. Why? The challenges were extremely frustrating and some parts of the map had such bad graphics that it actually lead me to turn it off due to eye strain. Not kidding. It was a great game with fun elements that fell short and unpolished. Now with Prototype 2... wow... let's just say it's nothing short of amazing. The graphics were vastly improved giving it a more realistic but comic-booky feel. Gameplay, controls and sounds are completely upgraded to make it seem like you're playing a movie blockbuster. James Heller is also one of the funniest, badass ""heroes"" I have ever played. This guy had me rolling so many times that I was replaying the campaign just to hear his one liners again. Seriously. There's an enemy called ""The Juggernaut"" that's a huge, fat, ugly looking mutant/thing and after the initial shock of Heller, you begin beating him to death until, just before the last blow, he says ""HUH, NOT DOING SO GOOD...ARE YA' FATTY!!""... I literally had to pause the game and just lmao. I know it's kinda random but it's little things like that that make an action game like this (over the top) an enjoyable experience.

On a side note, I almost quit playing the game because of a glitch that prevents you from unlocking missions. It breaks the game. Completely. 81% completion it suddenly stopped and there was nothing I could do but just run around killing the infected. BUT... as I said initially, the game is SO FUN that it didn't hurt going back and doing it all over again. *Note: Don't look for collectibles during the campaign. Wait 'til you finish it. That helps into not getting the glitch.

Overall, this game is completely awesome. Almost underrated"
5.0	"I had never played any of the Fire Emblem games before, but after this one, I'm hooked!

I had more fun playing match-maker than the actual strategy portion of the game though... I had more fun playing match-maker than the actual strategy portion of the ..."
5.0	"I find this game very eay to get lost in. Graphics are great, story is good enough; it's not the best but it is interesting. Voice acting is good, controls are good on both Mouse/KB and gamepad. It does have some performance issues and at the time of writing this AMD useres are having some problems running the game compared to their Intel/Nvidia counterparts.

Playing this game is a blast, whether its running around searching for loot, completing missions or just helping people. Going online is also a lot of fun. You can take part in some of the PvP or opt out and group up with others and go about your business as usuall. Co-op in this game comes highly recommended IMO.

If you have an Intel i5 or better and a GTX 660 or better, pick it up, it's a lot of fun. If you're on AMD, wait for a patch. Dying Light is worth the retail price IMO, however a sale would make it that much sweeter.

Current state 4/5
If all performance issues are patched its an easy 5/5 for me. Dying Light is a great experience."
5.0	MY 8 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LIKES THIS ALOT. GREAT SKYLANDER!
5.0	Fits nice. Long battery life. Doesn't take for ever to charge. The cord could be longer but no biggie! Thank get buy
5.0	This game is a blast! I'm an RPG fan to the end. Shooters do not come naturally to me, and I tend to nerd out over character customization and in-game romances, but this game had a level of dark intrigue that I couldn't pass up, and I'm glad I didn't! Partly, it plays like a puzzle or a maze, in that you have to be tactful and patient and observant. It's not a straight up shooter where you just have to be good at fighting. You get this sense of accomplishment when you FINALLY work your way past this chunk that you have memorized after the sixth time, and then BAM, you just turn the corner and there's like three giant creatures you've never even seen before and you panic and start running hopelessly thinking if you run through everything, they'll miss you and you can find a check point, but then you die, and you just silently turn the console off and vow never to play again until you turn it on the next night because it's a blast! Fun, even for casual players like me!
5.0	We have enjoyed all video games purchased and at this time have been great.  The are in good condition and all have been playable.  The grand children have been able to play them and enjoy them.  There is nothing more that I can say about this video game as I personally do not play games. yes liked
5.0	Looks good, great detail. Roy's our boy
5.0	I bought this game not knowing any thing about it. I read a few reviews that said the controlls were a little diffucult, but you could use a gamecube controller to make it a little easier. So i bought it for the simple reason that a racing games are always fun. My opinian is that most people are not fare to this game because they are not patient enough to get used to the controlls. Now i won't lie to you the motion sensing controlls are a bit unrefined. It is a little difficult to get used the motion sensing but it is possible to use them. If you don't have a gamecube controller you can just simply use the d-pad on the Wiimote for controll. What i do is use the d-pad and motion sensing at the same time so i don't have to hold the remote completly level. Besides that the game is nearly perfect. One cool feature is the different boards: heavy characters have a bike where you can bust through walls. Lite characters have a glider that flies through rings, and the semi heavy characters grind rails. Now the game has a few flaws, what game doesn't? One is that their are eight courses for the sonic team and eight courses for the babylon rogues, most if not all babylon rogues courses are dark versions of sonic team courses. They do offer a few differnet challenges but thats about it. The missions are also a bit  repettitive. All in all I consider this one of the better games for the Wii. A must have. Better than people say.
5.0	Received game just as promised.  it  came just as I expected, game in good condition and I've enjoyed it very much. Great shape
5.0	"First of all I've been playing games since Radio Shack put out Pong...yes, I'm a 43 year old gamer.  I dig several different types of games and mainly it has been the Battlefield series since BF was only on the PC.  Now, I really have to give this game 5 stars even though it has a couple of flaws.  It is a very refreshing change from the other First Person Shooters (FPS) out there - Yes, I understand this is a third person shooter until you scope your rifle.

The mission will suck you in and the kill cam is awesome and I never every got sick of that.  I played through the whole game, which I must say was short, but very enjoyable.  I even bought the DLC, as who would not like a chance to shoot Hitler - be warned that it will take most people just 25 minutes to beat at a $10 price tag.

The game also allows for campaign co-op to where you can have a buddy play the campaign with you which puts a different element to the game, in other words some re-playability after you complete the game on single player.  You don't get as many full kill-cam shots playing with a buddy but it is a lot more fast paced and it's cool to share in the awesome shots you make with a buddy.

Seriously, since this game is so different and well put together I had to give it 5 stars.  I mean really, look at Sniper: Ghost Warrior - Sniper Elite V2 blows that game away in many different ways.  The kill cam in this game is way better, the AI's are better, the missions are better, and you don't get hung up on the environment (at least I didn't).  Both games do have issues with AI spotting you though; I mean the regular soldiers not snipers, from a good distance.  It is a lot worse in Sniper: Ghost Warrior though.  They will spot you in that game even though you are hidden.  The only thing I can say about Sniper: Ghost Warrior that is better is that you sometimes have a cut-scene before a mission to show how you got to the area you are in.  In Sniper Elite V2 you just all the sudden are right in a fox hole with German or Russian soldiers.  With that flaw aside it's worth picking up for $50 bucks for sure.

Another cool element to the game is the challenges which are very tough alone and makes for a cool extra to test your skills with a buddy.  It's a still from the Horde mode in Gears of War, but what the hell - it should be copied because it's fun and challenging.

If one of your hobbies is playing games a couple of times a week and you want something fun and different in the FPS campaign category (oh, and the thought of being a sniper is cool to you) - look no further, grab a copy of this game. A Welcomed Change Frome The FPS Out There"

5.0	"Mind blown. This game is incredible and I'm loving it! The intro literally left me with my jaw dropped. It's insanely immersive and will pull you deep into the story, right from the start. It kept me on my toes and left me with anticipation for what was coming at the turn of each corner.

As with all Metal Gear Solid games, the action is excellent. The graphics are top notch. And overall game play is a blast. I've been a fan of the series since the beginning, and this game didn't disappoint.

Prepare for an epic adventure if you purchase this game. Completely Awesome. Realistic Feeling and Immersive"

It won't accelerate your graphics or do your laundry but it will insure that your mouse moves smoothly and your gaming area will look even that much cooler.

The lighting is very consistent around the perimeter and the color range is great.  Very good looking.

If you are looking for some functional bling for your desk this won't disappoint. Functional and fun.  Great addition to the game room, man cave or your personal place"

5.0	"I was skeptical of this device and the other similar devices, but I gave it a shot after getting tired of seeing the long wire behind the Kinect, since it was sitting on my front right standing speaker. I ended up getting this slightly-more expensive mount over a cheaper one here on Amazon to protect my $100 investment in the Kinect.

I have a 65"" Sony XBR65X810C TV (pretty decent besides the Android TV glitches occasionally), and this mount worked fine for it. The bezel around the screen on the TV is 0.5 inches, and that's exactly what the mount needs (the mount's ""lip"" does NOT cover the screen, not even a little bit).

The instructions were definitely a little confusing, they talked about a ""pull-out extension"" which sounded to me like the base where the Kinect sits could be extended further towards the back of the Kinect and the wall behind my TV, but I guess that was probably just a grammatical misinterpretation by the writers of the instructions (or me). They probably were talking about the bottom part that rotates down to steady the mount further (which I do use).

I was surprised by how steady this mount keeps the Kinect! Barring a large earthquake, I'd be surprised if the unit ever fell off. Sturdy, good choice."
5.0	Classic  Five Stars
5.0	An amazing game, but hey just read the other posts and you'll get the idea. Though, I can honostly see how this game would not be for everyone. The games a little on the darker side and not much for brighter colors (In other words, though graphics are good it's just not... PRETTY:(If you like the way Action RPGs play like Zelda,Lagoon,etc and don't like the way the diablos games play then you will not enjoy this game.  But all that aside its a very enjoyable game. Yes, I know I practicaly bashed the game and yet gave it five stars. It's just that everyone else said it so well, as to how good the game is, that is. I just figured I would highlight why one might not like this game:) so please, don't stop here read the other reviews that people have written and they will explain how wonderful this game is;) Great game that followed a great Anime series!!

5.0	"I have only gotten to play the game for a few hours but I really like it the new control configuration is taking some getting used to.  Everytime I play I hit the wrong button for block and parry which is also different to counter you have to hit two buttons the block then attack which is okay just gets some getting used to.  I had no idea we were going to be playing connor's Dad in the beginning as he wasn't advertised anywhere in the trailers or anywhere really he is a little slower as he is more reserved I really like the twist involved with Kenway (connor's father) would be cool if his twists were a part of the reasons for having a different control configuration.  I am glad they finally put horses back into the game and i think it's cool that they put other animals into the game as well.  the only thing i see that is a little weird about the game which is no big deal to me but i can see it being a big deal to those that like to complain is that animals and pedestrians can disapear sometimes once they end up for the lack of a better word in your peripheral and when you go to look they are really gone and when you eagle eye he seems to be floating and not standing on the platform i could live past it doesn't effect my fun lol oh also in the first episode on the ship the captains lips weren't moving during a cutscene but he was talking lol...  I love the assassins creed series and how everything connects from game to game not very many games do that they come out with part 1,2,3 and you never start where you left off on assassins creed you always start right where you left off now if you remember playing the first assassins creed and you were left thinking what? how is that an ending? it was made better because when you played assassins creed 2 it started right where you left off.  Now I have had friends who had started playing from brotherhood or revelations and they were like i can't get into it i was like you  have to play the first two man once you understand the story you are hooked.  I wouldn't suggest skipping brotherhood or revelation either even though this one is titled part 3 brotherhood and revelation at least on Desmond's part of the storyline are important.  I personally hope to see this series getting to a point where you are playing as desmond in current times the whole game without him going into the Animus.

- Statue, Flag, Belt buckle and journal are awesome I really wanted the flag and the statue.  I wasn't disapointed in my extra 50 dollars for this limited edition Awesome!"
5.0	I don't like dealing with the AA batteries, so I wanted to buy the charging kit. The rechargeable battery lasts a pretty long time. I can't say exactly how long it lasts, but if I had to guess I would say that I probably played about 20 hours before I had to charge it again. Great product. Lasts a good amount of time
5.0	works great -when a big gammer and doing videos for utube - so cool great sound and picture easy to use and fun sony playsation  eye camera (bulk packing)
5.0	Great game that takes you to the perspective of a spider or scorpion. At first I didn't know if I should get it or not, which is why I didn't get this game earlier. The game is great these aren't talking creatures or things with any other motives than kill or be killed. and that's what makes it so great. Why hadnt i played this.
5.0	"Great portable version of Super Smash Bros. I've been playing Smash Bros since the N64 and really enjoy this version, it is much better than Super Smash Bros Brawl on Nintendo Wii because the the online isn't laggy and there is no random ""tripping"" mechanic. Great portable version of Super Smash Bros!"
5.0	"WARNING: this game is not for the wussies. Do NOT play this game if you are weak in any way. This game contains high speed, fast paced, and high flying action. This game has no limits, no rules, and no mercy. (END OF WARNING) All of this is true. the greatest basketball game that money can buy. this game takes arcade action to the extreme. you will love it because it makes you look like a mad baller it two minutes of playing. If you have the money, this is the game to buy. Remember.... YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!! "" Did I say You Could Shoot That?"""
5.0	"Picked this up the other day....suffice to say they are selling like hotcakes at the Gamestops across the country.

This is a definite purchase for a Wii Owner:

Included in the package is:
Charging Stand
2 Rechargeable Battery Packs
2 Rubberized Battery Covers (Necessary to use)

After unpacking the unit....you see that the rechargeable battery pack slides inthe the Wii Remotes battery compartment with a snap and has a protruding part with the 4 metal contacts for the charging station.....this is why the use of the rubberized battery compartment covers is mandatory as the covers have the hole for access to the battery contacts.

Placing the controllers with everything installed into the charger initially worried me as I wasn't sure if I had to remove the Wrist Straps.

Thankfully...you do not have to....there are small grooves on the left and right of the stand for you to lay the Wrist strab connection through.

Charging of the 2 remotes from install took approximately 3-4 hours.....and everything works like a charm and it looks great.

If you have a Wii....buy it....[...] with batteries....not too bad :) Get this for your Wii!!!"

When I heard this game was a remake of one of the old origonals, I had to check it out. I love the ideology of all the FF games, and they made good usage for the dual screnes of the DS. Not a lot of use for the stylus, though. But, it is a remake. The graphics are nice, even though their nothing like the opening movie, but that's to be expected. I love the fight setup, easy to understand even for the beginning FF player. Lovin' it

5.0	"How do you play Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch exactly? Easy, using the joycons as you would use a wii remote controller.
But why stop there? The advantage of playing Just Dance on the Switch is that if by any chance you need to start an impromptu dance party literally anywhere, you could very well do so. Just pull out your switch tablet, grab them joycons and get moving.

The one disadvantage JD on the Switch has against, lets say, the Wii U version, is the lack of a camera. Which immediately removes camera related features you may be used to. Like Autodance, Video challenges, Community remix contributions and Just Dance world cup video entries. If you don't really care or know what any of those things are, then you are good to go with this version. Dance everywhere"
5.0	Pretty excellent fighting game i must say. Deserving of 5 stars... Ships fast and very convenient.. Five Stars
5.0	If you're looking for a casual, compact, portable system to play games on the go, then the Micro is perfect.  Unlike the Gameboy Advance SP, the Micro doesn't sport the clamshell design which kind of made the SP kind of clunky.  Instead, the Micro did away with the clamshell design and made a slim, flat design.  This thing is incredibly small.  It's about the size of two stacked Ipod Nanos.  This will easily slide into the tightest pockets.  The Micro sports a smaller screen than the SP, but that doesn't mean it loses clarity or brightness.  In fact, Nintendo boasts that the screen on the Micro is the best screen they've ever put on their Gameboy brand, even better than the DS.  It inclues five brightness adjustments.  Words appear in crystal clarity and the color of the games are much crisper and brighter.  The buttom layout is very comfortable and resembles the old NES controller.  Another cool thing is that the START and SELECT buttons light up a cool blue when charging and blinks red when the battery is low.  The Micro has great battery life, lasting about 10 hours between charges, the same as the SP.  Perhaps the best selling point of the Micro, besides its dimunitive size, would be the customizable faceplates.  You get two different faceplates upon purchase, but Nintendo will eventually put out more designs making for unlimited combinations of expression and even become fashionable.  Pick a faceplate to match your outfit or your mood.  What's great about the faceplates too is that it is the screen protecter for the Micro screen beneath.  So if you happen to scratch the faceplate, you just replace it, no problem.  However, Gameboy has always been about portable gaming and it delivers with a library of over 700 games.  Don't compare this to the PSP or the DS.  The PSP might boast music and movie cabapilites, but it's still victim to its lack of good games, its large size, and overshadowing UMD movies. Gameboy has always been simple - simple design and simple gaming.  Maybe that's why they've had such a strong hold on the handheld market.  Sony should take a note from Nintendo *psst* Sony, sometimes less is more. Micro-riffic!

5.0	"It's a 1st person action game, not primarily a shooter. You basically take the role of a detective trying to figure things out. Graphics are fairly polished, sounds is minimal but very atmospheric and gets you in the mood. It controls like most 1st person games, but in this the emphasis is less on spraying bullets and more on using available resources.

Overall I rate this highly because it's different from your standard 1st person game. It does a good job of getting you into the character. It has decent production values and in the end, when I finshed it I felt satisfied. Condemned 2"

It is Oblivion with guns and so much more. This is a very deep game with complicated quests.

5.0	"Had this wheel for about a year now and love it!  Bought it originally for use with GT5P and also have used it with the PS2 and GT4.  Works equally as well with NFS Shift.  Feathering the throttle and using the brake come so much more natural and having the steering wheel is a lot easier to drift around corners with and maintain a straight line.  Probably the best accessory I have purchased for my PS3.  Has a good quality feel to it as well.  The USB cable isn't the longest (maybe 10'?), but that is due to me having a 65"" XBR and no need to sit that close. Makes the average racer using a dualshock better, much better"

5.0	Has a free game with it compared to the other models of similar price.  Why wouldn't you buy this one really?  Even if you never play that game.  The design looks good too. Looks good, plays good.
5.0	"Things I love most about Guild Wars is:

1) Free online gaming (wow, what a concept).
2) competitive but fair gameplay--the ""loot"" is equally split among the party so no one will feel bad about not having what they want; or argue over items.
3) players are quite friendly and eager to help ""newbies""; unlike some OTHER online games.
4) easy to use in game controls (mostly)
5) combat, quests become tougher as you get higher in levels.
6) you can play at your own leisure, solo (with henchmen or heroes) or with friends.
7) though complex, the one can pick up the game quick.
(for instance, there's a lot of in-game things not explained in manuals liek crafting, salaving parts.  You either experiment, or ask other players for help).
8)  there's always something new to do/discover even at level 20.
9) the professions seem equal in strength and weaknesses (through observation mostly, I have yet to advance the other characters)/
10)  it's a richly developed world where cooperative play is fun.

things I don't like about it?  minor, very minor.

sometimes the camera angles get on my nerves.
the music/sound quality isn't so good. I often have my computer playing other music while I play.
gameplay does get somewhat recycled, though the replay factor is high. It's not boring, like others.  It does become more challenging.
sometimes the map doesn't show the correct area on which the final destination of reward is.
Missions don't always tell players where they need to go--very frustrating. One can spend an idiotic amount of time just running in circles. [though, that's probably just me]
okay, someone else brought this up...the henchmen could be a little stupid. They don't use their skills as often as I like (for example, the healer monk doesn't heal often enough).
Though this game is built on how you use your skills, good items help tremendously.  The monsters seem to have better skills...(sometimes). I looked it up, Life Syphon doesn't seem to be a skill/spell players can capture or use. (though, I have yet to discover this).

minor quibbles for a terrific game.

other than that? It's a fantastic game to which I will buy the add-ons. Fun, addictive and fair gameplay"

5.0	"Mount and blade: the original that started it all but sort of sucked unless you had mods the game itself had no objective only to be a mercenary or declare war on the faction of your choice also there were a wide variety of mods such as 1866, Last days of the 3rd age, Star Wars Conquest 9.4.00 (or something), World War 2 China, and of course Sword of Damocles.

Mount and Blade Warband: Probably the best mount and  blade there is advanced combat system, marriage, and a Crapton of mods such as 1257AD, The Last Days, Gekojuko, 1860's america, Brytenwalda, Blood in the West, Light and Darkness and a Clash of Kings (game of thrones)

Mount and Blade Warband With Fire And Sword: Not Much to say about it short storyline a few downgrades by taking some of the things from warband that were supposed to be there before no mods out there except WFAS enhancement and so forth.
Overall since i love sandboxes this is the best i have played Mount and blade collection"

5.0	This charger works perfectly. My controller is always charged and if not, this will charge it in less than a hour. I love how this looks with the gray clear and black plastic makes it look fancy. The LED's are extremely bright but thats only minor. The controller falls right into its spot which only requires me placing it and not fumbling with the USB wire anymore. I would recommend this to anyone with an PS3. Just so you know, this has the regular small wall adapter like a standard fan does; It doesn't have a huge outlet like some devices have and takes up multiple outlets. Works like a charm

5.0	"We started our Lego extravaganza with Indiana Jones the adventure continues and just loved that one. We now have several star wars, batman, harry potter, pirates of the carribean. We did not have the original Indiana legos for Wii. My one frustration prior to ordering I did not know if the two Indiana games would be partially the same game. They ARE NOT, but I really didn't know so I had to purchase and take the chance, I just wish ""the adventure continues"" would say ""all new adventures"" or something like that. I gave this 5 stars because my husband and I still love all the Lego wii games and especially both Indiana Jones. I don't like it quite as well as the adventure continues only because it seems like the adventure continues had much more indepth play and map adventures which both my husband and I like. Adventure continues also created a split screen for two players to adventure off in there own directions, and panning which lets your look up and down to see things such as overhead obstacles. Among other improvements. I didn't really want to deduct a star though, cus we are still happy with it.
  Overall though still great. Still better than Batman (cus its really dark/shadowy), Harry potter was really confusing until you really play a while, and star wars is just not quite as fun for us. Amazon delivery as always fast and well packaged. Definately great purchase for our lego Wii collection. purchased after loving ""The adventure continues"""

5.0	I'm not a shoot'em up game person.  I like casual games that offer good visuals, good mind exercise and an interesting premise.  I tend to use the 30 minute sample & then go away disappointed but Sacra Terra: Angelic Night had me hooked from the start.  It falls into that sweet spot, not too easy, not too hard.  Not to violent, not too saccharine.  Not to juvenile, not too dangerous.  All in all I think this is a great game for young and old alike. fun game that keeps you thinking
5.0	"Somehow they managed to make Assassins Creed the way it should have been done from the start.  it never feels repetitive. Never makes you say ""ugh, I want to get this power up but Is it worth letting the game jerk control out of my hands so it can show me the same cut scene I've already watched 497 times?"" Instead if grants brilliant game play and an addictive leveling system that makes you really feel like a badass.

The combat is fluid, responsive, adaptive and makes you feel like a great warrior yet still be challenging and force you to run sometimes. The Nemesis system is a really smart way to handle losing conditions too. Not only does it cause enemies to level up with you in a very natural and unpredictable way, it makes it so that losing actually makes the enemy more powerful in the future.

Hunting war chiefs doesn't require tons of planning and split second timing, but gathering Intel and taking the time to hit supporters 1 by 1 makes hits that were seemingly impossible down to the smooth, assassin-esque killing that Assassins Creed could only manage in cut scenes.

The story is thee, it is interesting but it's more of an aside to the game play. Really it could stand with no story Other than ""Go kill Uruk"" Succeeds where Assassins Creed continues to fail"
5.0	"Despite being one of the early movie to game translations (others on the systems include Rocky, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm street, Halloween, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre) this is the best of the set.  All the others suffered from variosue flaws to include insane difficulty, unresponsive controls, or bad graphics.  This has none of those real problems. The controls move smoothly for the system, and the story follows the 2nd movie precisly.  However like many great NES classics this game also has outstanding music.  They didn't need to hire Big name groups or spend thousands upon thousands of dollars to hire an orchestra, no they just used their trusty keyboard and their creativity.
True to the NES there is the challenge.  The enemies are fairly difficult to beat and at times there are insane jumps to make.  But it's these things that made the NES so great.  Today's games rely to much on eye candy to buy games.  The NES couldn't do that and so we have the challenge.  Another series that just got to easy was Mega Man.  Has any one out there truely gone through the first game the first time playing it.  I doubt it because it is insanly difficult.  Or beat Act 6 in Ninja Gaiden with 1 life, like I said doubtful (unless you were a game Genie cheater).  In the end I would stick with this classic in the NES archives because it is very well overlooked but is truely a great in the industry.  MAny people agree with me when I say that the NES and even the SNES were the greatest systems of all time.  THey had the best line up olf games because the industry was still very young.  They saw the mistake with ET and Ataris decline so they did what needed to be done to survive.  This is another one of those greats, buy it today. Don't deny the old classics"
5.0	"I had this thing lying around my room for months and didn't care enough to even burst the wrapping and try it out. Heard it was like a lamer version of Mario Party. Boy I tell ya, disinformation is a hell of a thing. Some guy on Youtube asked me (completely out of the blue) to play with him online in Fortune Street cuz he saw I had the game from a comment I made. I was like ""what?! That crap has online?!"". So I decided to try it out. If it weren't for him I'd never know how awesome this game was. This game is a A LOT of fun, and even cooler with the online mode.

The game outside of any of the gaming modes kinda lags lol. The graphics are choppy as hell with light detail. Only when you start a game it's good. This game is NOT like Mario Party, it's like Monopoly, but different so it's original. Up to four players, human or AI, and you use your Miis. You can customize the hell out of your Miis. Outfits, poses, gestures, the way they walk, your player description and gameplay style. It's cool. Now there are a bunch of people from all over the world who's friend codes I've added and we play online all the time. It's great. Won my first online match too lol.

I gave this game 5 stars based on gameplay. If it were graphics it would have gotten 2. This is in itself a great example of the word, ""a Nintendo game"" lol. Horrible Graphics, Terrible Frame Rate, Great Game"
5.0	All good games.  Well worth the money.  Hours and hours of game playing content. Great graphics. All good games. Well worth the money
5.0	Great! Five Stars
5.0	"This game is totally awesome. I love monopoly. I would spend hours on pogo playing Monopoly Here and Now Edition. After much research I did see there were two versions of the Monopoly game. Monopoly Streets and monopoly Here and Now Edition. After endless days of reading customer reviews I have decided to go with Monopoly Streets and so glad that I did. It offers endless hours of fun!
The streets and the 3d buildings are sooo beautiful, and also you can play classic monopoly on the classic board. There are other boards that you can unlock as you build monopoly money and one other 3d city you can unlock. You can also unlock Tokens and the ability to use your Mii character (which really sold me on this game).

There is different ways you can play the game and you can also customize the game play anyway you want to make interesting. I just the love the fact that I can play monopoly and not have to count the money (the game does it for you) and no pieces to clean up after wards!
Also, there are characters that go along with the tokens, these characters are funny for the first time you play the game but afterwards they can get a bit annoying, like the dog token comes with a lady, the wheelbarrow token comes with a redneck girl, Who is my favourite because she kicks her wheelbarrow when she has to pay max rent to someone and you can hear her say oww lol that cracks me up! You have the option to play with Easy AI, Medium AI or Hard AI.. The computer players aren't hard to beat.. It definately nice to play a game by yourself considering the computer players are very easy to trade with, playing with more people can be frustrating because they don't want to trade. Played a game with hubby and he wouldn't part with Boardwalk at all, can be frustrating at times lol. Plus it's fun to kick some AI butt!
I am deffinately very glad that I purchased this game, if you like monopoly then this is the game for you! Hope you can enjoy it as much as we do,definately worth the price! Awesome game!"
5.0	I bought this for the brother in law, and had so much fun playing it, I will be purchasing a 360. I am an avid Xbox player, and these games have destroyed my notion of how games should look, sound and play, especially this game. Gears will be the first game I buy for my own 360. I need a 360
5.0	we have the pc version, got this so I could play too, I love it would recommend it to anyone good game
5.0	This item arrived on time, great description, and works great! Very happy with purchase! great description, and works great
5.0	I really enjoyed this game.  If you like shooters, you will probably like this game. Love it
5.0	"One of the better games with some plot choices.  One thing I would like to see would be a more ""open"" form of gameplay.  As it is, there are stages or chapters and once you leave one there is no going back.  It is a very good game that I would purchase again.  It might have been a better game if it was more open and allowed the quests to overlap between the zones more with one opening up another requiring returning to a previous area, etc.. Awesome game"
5.0	I bought this mostly because I am a huge Halo/Master Chief fan, but I could also use another controller. And this controller is excellent. I love the design and feel of it. My wife didn't know I had ordered this, but even she thought it looked pretty neat. It handles great, I've been using it for about a week now, and I look forward to playing Halo 5 on it! An excellent looking controller
5.0	I like this game.  It's nice to go from a room to another room shooting robots to destroy them to finish the missions. A Great Third Person Shooter
5.0	Great game! Destroy buildings, tanks and fight other monters. You can adjusts the view while fighting so you can see the action. I can't understand anything the people are saying. Just press circle to continue. Graphics are not the best. I'm hoping the U.S. PS4 version will be improved graphic wise. Fun for any Godzilla fan!
5.0	Kids love it. Makes me happy. Too bad they still argue over it. Kids love it.
5.0	Nice quality! Feel and sound great! I own a few sets of headphones mainly for gaming and I'm really enjoying these so far. I have been able to use them with my PS4 and PC and really like the compatibility and sound quality I get from these. They are very solid for music as well. I have a set of Lucid Sound LS30s that are pretty awesome too but have had software issues where they freeze up sometimes. Got these as backups but now they have become my primary PC headsets. I cannot overstate how comfortable they are. The faux leather earmuffs feel silky smooth and they come with an extra set of cloth ones if you prefer. I haven't tried those yet. I've heard about the issues with the wiring connections a few people have had so I will update if I experience any of that. I've had them for a couple weeks now and so far so good. I got them for a great price but would have paid more for them anyway after having tried them out. Very good quality build. Sound great. Versatile!
5.0	"When I heard that the one had a redesigned controller, I cringed.  While I had never loved the 360 controller, I had grown very accustomed to it.  I was very worried that this new controller would feel awkward in my hands.

I am glad to report that the new controller is different in good ways, and the same in all the right ways.

The new triggers and bumpers have a great feel and are slightly more ergonomic.  The edge of the trigger has been eased where your finger wraps around making it a bit more comfortable for extended game sessions.  The trigger has slightly less resistance than the old trigger, which I found acceptable, my son is not as big a fan.  The sticks feel a bit more precise, but more than anything they feel the same which is a good thing in my book.

The most obvious change to the controller is the battery pack.  The battery pack has been replaced with a AA battery compartment.  No longer is there a wart on the backside of the controller, which makes it a bit more comfortable.  The batteries are a bit more awkward to swap in a rush than a battery pack was, but it is still very manageable.

The new controller is very slightly heavier at 9 7/8 oz vs 9 1/2 oz.

The dpad is now recessed, but feels right.

The location of the X, back and start buttons is a little awkward if you are used to the old controller.  Thankfully these are not often used in the heat of the moment and they are generally close enough to where they were to find them by feel.

Checkout my pictures to see the difference in the trigger. Change in the right ways."
5.0	Fun for the kids and the kids at heart to play the disney infinity games.  But before you buy check and see, but I think disney is going to no longer do the infinity games. fun for the kids
5.0	"I have been playing race sims for a very long time.  This is my first wheel.  I have the xbox one and I'm working it on Forza 7, so the most recent of things works with this wheel.  There are rubber pats on the bottom of the peddles so if you have an uncarpeted floor you can just make sure the pads and your floor are clean and you're just great.

The paddle shifts are great, the force feed back really makes it feel pretty awesome.  Going from the hand controller to this wheel makes the small corrections to fix your race line possible.  It was so frustrating to want to just make a slight correction to load your line from the right side of the road to the left or the other way around and you would have to make a jerky move that would scrub speed or you were just going to have to try to run the inside line and probably end up either braking too much or maybe you'd end up going off.

This is just so much better.  The feedback really is not as smooth as a car, seriously, what is though.  But, I'd buy this one again over and over and over.

Easy set up, easy take down, can use it to get into and out of the game and to navigate inside the game.  Absolutely amazing.

The only thing I would change is making the USB cable longer, because my xBox isn't right in front of me...  going to try to use an extension for the USB cable and see what happens. There are rubber pats on the bottom of the peddles so if you have an uncarpeted floor you can just make sure the pads and your floor are clean and you're just great. The paddle shifts are great"
5.0	Worked as expected! Worked as expected!
5.0	Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a well-made game that perfectly blends battle sequences and puzzles.  The battles, which can only be won using the right method against the right enemy, are simplified by Z-Targeting, which aims all attacks at the enemy.  It takes a long time to beat (months), as any good RPG (Role-Playing Game) should.  Unfortunately, it constantly and inevitably reminds you of the controls, although they're pretty easy, in messages which you usually must read.  I suggest this for all people, especially those that enjoy a good challenge. Fun, Long-Lasting, and Annoying
5.0	You can get this game for FREE at moddb or Taleworlds. Free Game
5.0	great product, arrived before expected delivery date. Five Stars
5.0	Every version of this game is a lot of fun. Nintendo continues to produce new things for this, the two drivers, special items and picking your kart make this even better than the N64 version. Mario Kart is still great...
5.0	The story is great, the cinematics make it seem like you're watching a movie (and interacting with it) and the replay value is amazing (collect treasures, play the game sped up, as well as the challenges).  Definitely one of the best games on the PS3! Indiana Jones of the 21st Century
5.0	It's COD and you know what you are getting when you buy it. The graphics and control are great. There is nothing ground breaking here but it's fun. I will never understand why people waste their time trolling a game they've never played. If you like COD then you'll have a good time. Fun
5.0	Now that I finally have Windows 7, I'm finally able to play this game. It's quite fun. Managed to become an 11th level Jedi Knight and I finally got to construct my lightsaber and leave Tython. May not be able to become a subscriber at this present time, but I should be able to do it next month, after I get my next check. The Force Is Strong With This One!
5.0	works as described, clear crispy sound and the others players hear me clearly as well, i am pleased with this set great product
5.0	"The best game I play in a long time. The level's are cool and very pretty. The background color is great and smooth.
Rayman is trying to save himself and he's friend's form being takeing over. If he does't the world will be lost forever.
In the game to save the world you must fine four mask in the hidden world's and in the game rayman's friend's will help you to get your power's back.
You are in rayman's world now. Help him save the world before it is to late. In the game you will fine lums in cages in the world's help the lums escape. There are many lums. There are blue lums, lums that give you air. And there are red lums that give you heath and life. In the game you get to go in the pretty places and the darkness places in the game. Save the world form evil and darkness before the goodness is gone forever.
Have fun in the game I did and I love it, you will love it too.
I hope. Rayman 2 The Great Escape"
5.0	It was just what I was looking for and needed. Product was exactly as described above. Would recommend to others. Perfect
5.0	BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU Five Stars
5.0	"I used to feel left out not being able to play Unity because I didn't own a PS4, but this made up for it. This is black flag with tweaks and a new story. Very fun if you enjoyed black flag.

Having recently gotten a PS4 and Unity, I have to say it sucks, but this game makes up for it. They should have ported this to PS4 instead. Now with Unity the series can never be trusted again, and it might be the downfall of the series. 100 Times better than Unity"
5.0	"3DS Lego games suffered from a change in format since Lego Marvel Super Heroes but Lego Batman 3 has gone back to it's original format.

The levels are back to being fully explorable, you can flip back and forth between numerous characters on the bottom screen again and yes, THEY HAVE GIVEN YOU THE JUMP ABILITY BACK (I know this is a big deal for a lot of people)! Plays pretty much the same as the previous lego batman games. They have implemented the gold brick challenges and are now viewable before starting a mission eliminating the guess work. They're pretty simple like finding hidden items, collecting a certain amount of studs. At the start of the game you will play mostly as Batman and Robin but you will be playing as other superheroes at the game progresses.

Other features include full voice acting and real cutscenes that don't feel like they've been rushed. If you've played the Lego Batman 2 then you know Batman and Robin (and other characters) have multiple abilities that need to be swapped through and they can quickly be equipped and unequipped without changing the character itself. So for example, Robin's hazard suit can be taken on and off instead of having two separate Robin characters. The game at times does make use of the stylus/touchscreen as well for puzzles.

Long story short if you (or your kid) loved Lego Batman 1 and 2 on the handheld then this one is an instant buy.

EDIT: One more thing to point out. If you lose all of your hearts you DO NOT have to start the level over. It returns to the lego batman 2 format of just losing your studs and the character respawning in the exact same spot. Batman saves 3DS Lego games from the changes everyone hated"
5.0	Purchased the Wii Karaoke Revolution game that came with a mic, however wanted to have dual mics going.  I would say this one is even a bit better than the one that came with the Karaoke game.  Very solid and well constructed, plugs right into the usb port on the Wii and works great.  Highly recommend this mic. Great additional microphone
5.0	This game is truly awesome when I first saw this game it was too expensive and I ended up getting the DS version instead. But when I did get this game I loved it, I only played this game when my in-law let me borrow his copy of the game. While this game is a more modern NES  game on the Wii. But none the less I love this game because its just another fun Mario classic like Super Mario 64 on N64. This game has a lot of challenges and I love collect the star coins, this game is an absolute must, buy it you won't regret it. New Super Mario Bros For Nintendo Wii
5.0	"As someone who is reluctant to ""early adopt"" because of getting burned before (**cough** Palm Pre), I waited a year to get this and have not been disappointed in the least! What an incredible revolution in gaming. You become so immersed in the games that you forget what's going on around you in real life. I am excited to see some of the creativity in newer games coming out as there is a LOT of potential with this platform. When you play the games, you feel as though you are there. This also does not feel like an extension of the PS4, but rather an entirely different gaming system.

Some minor criticisms:
- As others mentioned, the cord can be annoying attached to the headset. Speaking of which, there are a LOT of cords with this system.
- Don't expect the graphics to blow you away especially you've been using a PS4 Pro w/4k TV like myself (it's realistic enough but nowhere near the resolution or clarity of 4k gaming)
- Sony did some smart things with making it easy to adjust the headset to your head, but I still find myself having to constantly adjust it while wearing it because the screen can get slightly blurry. It does fit well with my glasses though so if you wear them you should be good. If you're thinking about it, stop thinking and just buy it!"
5.0	"This is deffiently the greatest game for the XBOX system.  It has great graphics a nice story and great special fx, weapons, music everything that takes a good game, its like an album with 10 songs in it, its like the debut album for a great band, that has the most original creative juices flowing.

First off you get instructions and what not, and a great story - 5/5

Difficulty has 4 different and equally fun versions of play - 5/5

Multiplayer is great having co op, and vs. modes with many different games for each - 5/5

Level 1 - A great opener for an intense game, have good story and introduces you to the play. 5/5

Level 2 - Another great level about fighting on an all terrain force, and rescuing soldiers. 4/5

Level 3 - Quite possibly the BEST level on the game. 5/5

Level 4 - A good fun album with a beach head mode in it. 5/5

Level 5 - Another great epic battle level. 5/5

Level 6 - A new enemy has arrived. 5/5

Level 7 - Though lengthy this level is great. 5/5

Level 8 - This level is possibly the most un entertaining level in the game, its too long and to numbered. 3/5

Level 9 - Were drawing closer and closer to a close here - 5/5

Level 10 - A fast paced good end level - 5/5

Price - Great for what you get. 5/5

5.0	This is a feature rich gaming mouse.  It has a great fit, finish, and feel.  I have used a Logitech G5 for years and it finally died.  I'm a big Logitech fan, but I really like the value/price of the Uranus... Would have preferred a name with less comedic oppurtunity, but I'm not complaining.  The control in the mouse's setup menu is a gamer's dream.  Too many buttons for my taste but you can disable or reassign anything. Had to lower the DPI bigtime...you breath and it moves, but after the adjustment it is excellent.  As long as it holds up over time it is easily the best mouse I've used.  Very highly recommended. It has a great fit, finish

5.0	One of the best games I've ever played. You need to play this.
5.0	It's a cheap very compatible controller for PC or Xbox (if you still use 360).  Ironically, out of all the 360 controllers I have ever owned. This brand was the only one to never give me problems. (I had two problem with first party controllers. One had an issue with the wire where I had to hold it in a specific spot for it to work, the other joystick broke). So far so good for PDP (been using them for 7+ years) I have been investing in these controllers for years.
5.0	"I love this game. If your a fan of mma or boxing or just want a great workout.  You HAVE to get this game.  I love to go into the training games section and hit the pads. Basically he holds up the pads in certain locations (jab, cross, hook, body, etc.) and you have to hit. You can set the difficulty aswell . Once your done with that, you can go fight an opponent. The game is very accurate. All the punches register, you really feel like your beating a guy up.

Just one thing, make sure to buy the 5 dollar training game upgrade from the ps3 store. That will allow you more training games which is the best part.

Other than that remember to upgrade your fighter by increase STAMINA mainly. The first thing you want to increase and max out is stamina because if you have weak stamina, you will lose everytime. Best Game for move and ps3"

5.0	If you know anything about the 1st fable, it's amazing, and Fable 2 does justice for a sequel.  The Gameplay is great and the story is pretty good, it's just the bugs.  There are so many bugs and glitches in the game it's ridiculous.  I have no clue why there are so many in the game, but it's such a good game that you tend to not even care that there are these terrible bugs.  If it were any other game, I would have quit for the glitches, but it's just such a sweet game that I didn't want to stop playing. Solid game despite flaws.

5.0	"I have played Silent Hill 2,3, on HD collection, and 4 on XBOX. This HD collection is simply awesome. There are so many complaints about the visuals and voices on the HDversion. I will give my opinion from someone  that didn't play the originals except SH4 but that's not on the collection anyhow. When I loaded the game it updated new data and patches for a while. First the framerate issues - none at all (need I say more)? Voice acting Silent Hill 2 you get the originals and newer ones. I chose the originals no problems there. SH3 doesn't sound bad to me at all. I guess there not as good as the originals. However there is so little dialog anyhow that I can not see how this would be such a major concern. The girls sound like girls and the men sound like men, not a big deal. SH2 the fog. Well the fog is all over the HD collection. It is hard to see while exploring the town. There is a bit of the sense that the fog is rolling with you instead of engulfing you. This does not effect gameplay and it's still hard to see. Besides the fog is only when you are outside and since the dread of the game really takes place exploring the inside of the buildings this was not a concern. Most of the time when you are outside it's dark and foggy so you use a flashlight and you run from creatures from place to place.  Those are the three biggest complaints that I have read from other players. There are some others like signs and stuff that changed and this has no effect what so ever on gameplay but purists say it ruins the game.

The visuals in SH3 are stunning. I could not believe that I was playing an old game. The game is simply awesome and I think they look more vibrant then the originals from the youtube comparisons I have seen. SH2 still has that old school look but the feeling of dread while playing this game is second to none, and the most powerful part of the game that easily makes everything else seem so petty. The story comes together nicely as well. SH2 has the highest dread factor of anygame I have ever played. Some of them are Dead space 1 and 2, Siren, SH Downpour, SH4, RE 1, The Thing, Stalkers, Half Life, Doom3.

By dread factor I mean the ""oh man, I really don't want to go around the next corner."" Or ""I really do not want to enter this room or run into Pyramid Head again."" I felt myself dreading the fact that I felt so compelled to play the game at all. It's not to bad looking back as a whole, but when your immersed in it you feel like screaming ""enough already.""

Play the game for what it is ( a great game in HD) instead of what it is not  - the original. awesome game"

5.0	"I do not get why so many people are writing bad reviews.  This headset works perfect.  It is very sensitive so you can whisper and it could pick it up and it fits nicely around the neck.  Sometimes the ear piece falls out of my ear but I just put it back in at a different angle and it stays.  This heatset works for most everybody and shouldn't be uncomfortable...unless you weigh a lot and have a big neck.

I have not had any problems at all with communicating with people and I have no problem understanding others.  This mic is better than the Xbox 360 official mics because with the official mics you have to talk really loud just to be heard. Excellent headset"

5.0	Okay Five Stars
5.0	This game will go down in history. It gives you chills down your spine in a lot of levels. It is very intense action gameplay. The multiplayer is amazing as well. BUY THIS GAME NOW!!! One of the Best games of 2001
5.0	This game is really, really cool! For starters, it's pretty easy to get used to. Secondly, it's fun. The game's nerve-racking tension gets higher and higher as your Trace Viewer (You'll have to buy that at the start of the game for virtual-money) bleeps and tells you that someone is 87% hacking you. Anyways, buy this game. It's fun and will keep you occupied for hours on end. Really Cool!
5.0	"Good vs Evil
This aspect of the game could have been half-hearted and like most games could have just become an alternative ending to the story depending on which you choose to be but in inFAMOUS this is just not the case. Become evil and Empire City starts to change in front of your eyes, the impact on the city that you cause is very visible. The skies turn red, the people in the streets turn against you and will even attack you, the story takes different twists and the missions you play are different. Empire city will look even more destroyed by the end of your evil rampage and this is really impressive to see. Choose to be Good and the city will start to repair itself, people will praise and thank you, the skies will become clear and blue and once again the things you get to do are completely different.

Graphics
In most open world games it's not uncommon to come across some poor low res textures and numerous glitches but in inFAMOUS it's clear to see that Sucker Punch have really got the most out of the PS3. What's really noticeable is the incredible amount of detail in the city. Even if you climb to one of the highest most obscure spots in the city the surfaces are all incredibly detailed and high resolution. The city itself has this really damaged feel which works well with the theme of the game, it's gritty but glam at the same time and just looks great no matter where you are. Cole is so well designed with fantastic animations and cool gear and the Reapers are just awesome. As for those comic-book style images that tell the story, whoever designed those deserves an award because they are the most stunning designs I have seen.

Powers
Where to start? inFAMOUS has so many cool powers and the sense of being able to grow and improve upon them is done really well with the upgrade system. Earn XP for everything you do in the game and become this amazing force of electricity where you can do the most amazing things. Electricity is never far away as you can basically use all of Empire City's resources to fill yourself up with juice. However don't confuse this with thinking that it's going to be an easy ride. If you're fighting a tough boss and need to fill yourself up with electricity you're going to have to use strategy to make sure you don't get caught out in the moments your electricity runs out. This makes battles tense and fun. Oh and don't forget when you're a source of electricity water can kill you so don't go thinking you can take a swim in the sea!

All I can tell you is GO AND BUT THIS GAME NOW. Seriously, I have been so addicted to this little masterpiece for the past few weeks now. It's clever and stylistic and so much fun with a TON of replay value. The story is great with some cool surprises. You've got a load of collectables, a great city that is technically impressive and a joy to play in. Thoroughly addictive gameplay and stunning music and sound effects. Easily one of THE best games of 2009 and probably the best superhero game I have ever played. I want a sequel really badly and I think this is the start of a fantastic new franchise. 10/10

Oh and did I meantion that this game has NO LOAD TIMES. Yes you heard me correctly, an open world game with stunning visuals and NO LOAD TIMES. This is real next-gen gaming. Power in the palm of your hand,"

5.0	I hopped onto the Playstation 3 bandwagon after playing God of War: Chains of Olympus and don't regret laying down that much money one bit.  God of War 3 is easily my favorite game since Halo 3 (just as the GOW series itself is my favorite series since Halo).  I just couldn't put it down and spent an entire weekend after getting the game playing it until I beat it - and I'm not usually that enamored with a game to spend my entire waking existence playing it.  It took me about 13 hours to finish it, which I guess seems to be about average.  The first big boss battle truly set the tone for the rest of the game and continues to be one of the most awe-inspiring openers I've ever seen in a game.  The game didn't stop from there.  Big boss battles are everywhere (I was amazed at how many parts were in killing Hades, but it was truly fun despite how long it takes to finally whittle him down), which is partly why the God of War series has been so successful - they're truly jaw dropping!  Being as I'd never played God of War 1 or 2 before (I'd only seen in-game movies and cutscenes), and having recently finished God of War 2, I must agree with some reviewers that the story isn't nearly as deep or telling as God of War 2's.  Musically, although I own the soundtrack, it's up to par with the amazing soundtracks of its predecessors, but I still feel GOW2's score is superior.  I also found the flying scenes to be more than a little annoying as there seems to be absolutely no rhyme or reason in terms of trying to navigate through them without hitting something (I think it's impossible), and I died many times before I finally made it through by sheer luck with enough health meter left (there's just no way flying that fast with the amount of beams and whatnot in the way that you can avoid them or fit through the small crevice you need to in time).  Puzzles can be annoying, especially when you have to do something with the clock ticking (it takes a few tries), but nothing was as time-consuming puzzle-wise here as some of the puzzles in God of War 2.  Graphically, God of War 3 takes the top, of course, as detailed in the big boss battles.  Overall, God of War 3 is one of the main reasons a PS3er should buy games (or one of the top games for anyone considering getting a PS3 in the first place).  Despite its very minor flaws (notably lack of deeper story and cool, albeit at times annoying flying scenes), God of War 3 is a resounding success through and through, a testament to everything today's action video games should be. What action games should be!
5.0	"Galactic Civilizations II Ultimate Edition is the latest and best installment of the Galactic Civilizations series, packing in both currently-available expansion packs in addition to the base game. It is a turn-based strategy/conquest game, allowing play to stretch out over days or even weeks. There is a lot to this game, but once you get the hang of how to play this game it is very much worth the time and effort.

To be very clear, this is a turn-based game, not a real-time strategy game or a first-person shooter. If turn-based games do not appeal to you, look elsewhere. If you have not played a turn-based game in the past, it is a different experience from most other games on the market in that the planning and strategizing require thinking in a different way, and this style of play is not something everyone enjoys.

One of the very first things that a player will notice about this game is that the graphics are absolutely stunning. Stardock put an incredible amount of effort and care into the interface, from the menus to the cut scenes. Everything is smooth, seamless and, well, beautiful.

Although the graphics are well-done, the interface is exceptionally complex and busy. The player manages almost every conceivable aspect of the game -  economy and tax rate, research direction and funding, relationships with other civilizations, planetary production, fleet composition, trade and more. It is very easy to get lost in the sheer volume of options available.

Gameplay starts with several choices, most importantly race but certainly not the only option. Victory conditions (more on that shortly), universe size, star cluster density, frequency of viable worlds, number of other civilizations, and a few other options are all specified at the start. After making all of these selections, the player gets a single planet, a colony ship, a survey ship and an asteroid miner.

Every turn consists of a number of important choices. The player decides how to allocate all of the resources available and takes steps to better their position, with the ultimate goal of meeting the victory conditions specified at the start. This may include exploration of space junk (there is frequently much benefit to doing so), colonization of a new planet, or perhaps cranking up the tax rate. Once all of the desired options have been selected, the player ends the turn and a new turn begins after all selections have been executed.

One of the most interesting aspects of the game is in designing new ships for the fleet. The player gets to pick hull type, armament, sensors and everything else a ship needs to be a successful contributor. Once a design is complete and named, any starport orbiting the player's planets can build those ships. It is important to keep in mind that some designs may not work well through the entire game but that sometimes a design should be retired in favor of new, more advanced designs.

Gameplay continues until victory conditions are met. There are several conditions that can be specified - military conquest, diplomatic victory (peace treaties with all other major civilizations), technological victory (done through research) or even a cultural invasion.

Every choice a player makes affects something else within the game. For example, higher taxes can cause a planet to mutiny and join a different civilization. More important, though, is how choices affect relations with the other civilizations. Most civilizations pay attention to ethical alignment and military might, and depending on how strong or weak a player's civilization can even incite a war. Finding a good balance is the key, and finding that balance is inherently tough.

As this version comes with both expansion packs, there are three campaigns that are available for play. I have not tried any of these so I cannot really comment on them.

This is a very engrossing game with slick graphics and many, many choices for the gamer who wants absolute control over every aspect of the game. If this style of play is appealing to you, seriously consider picking up a copy for yourself and say goodbye to your free time. Award-winning for a reason"

5.0	So at first i was a little upset because it was not installing the update and the PS4 was out of service, kids were a hot mess! So i contacted DongCoh and they replied in one day due to the time difference, yes they are in china. BUT! they were very attentive and helpful. Solved my problems and were able to get it up and running smooth! I would never have thought that the usb flash drive would be the problem. I have 2 PNY thumb drives one 8gb and the other 32gb, neither of them would work. The PS4 recognized it however a pop up would say unable to perform the update need latest software. I found a toshiba thumb drive following all the same steps and BOOM! it worked and now the kids have 3tb of memory on their ps4! So far everything is great and I will keep this post updated. At this time i recommend the DC Game Bar to anyone who is trying to expand their memory easy to install and fun to do with the kids. Thank you! Awesome Product great expansion at a good price!

5.0	"Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion
 I knew that as a reviewer I would have to get around to this some day- but that doesn't make it any easier.  Oblivion isn't as much a game for me as it is a drug- it was the reason that I spent $ 500 on my Xbox 360.  And while many games have graced my disc tray, some good, some bad, some outstanding, I find myself always returning to Tamriel to see what's going on.
 Oblivion is epic in scope.  Like all the Elder Scrolls games the developers have focused on creating a wholly believable world for the player to explore- and on the next-gen consoles that world has become freakin' gorgeous.  Oblivion is a graphical powerhouse, on par with Gears of War, Halo 3, or any game on any console.  Stone buildings look realistic, bushes and grass are done with amazing detail, and creatures look amazingly realistic.
 Oblivion begins, as all Elder Scrolls games do, with the player being released from prison.  This time, the player is released because the Emperor is trying to escape assassins by fleeing through an ancient escape route that leads through your cell.  After a short dungeon that serves as a tutorial, the Emperor is murdered in front of you- but before dying he asks you to find his last son and save the world.  After that, you're set loose and on your own time.  You can go do what the Emperor told you to do, go join a guild, go explore ruins, or just chase after butterflies until you can't find it anymore (I've done this).  The entire Imperial Province is open to you, and you can literally have a two hour play session, accomplish nothing, and still have a good time.  There are ruins to explore, dungeons to delve, forts to raid, and shrines to both the Deadra lords and the Nine Divines to find.  Optional side-quests are everywhere.
 It is impossible to talk about Oblivion without talking about what has changed from the previous game Morrowind.  The first big change is the map- the player now has Link's magic compass that allows the player to have markers on the map, allowing for more playtime and less trying to figure out where you are.  The second welcome change is to the journal.  Entries are now arranged by quest, and quests are arranged by date, making easier to find the entry you're looking for then the strictly by date system of Morrowind.  Combat is much improved, no longer bound by the d20 system, and skills like lock-picking have gotten the same overhaul- now locks are a skill based minigame rather then a pass-fail hidden dice roll.  Oblivion also feels shorter then Morrowind, and more focused.  This is just an observation, not an indictment.  It took me over a year to beat Morrowind's main quest (with massive side trips into Bloodmoon and Tribunal), I went through Oblivion's in a little over a month.  But two years of downloadable content have filled Oblivion out nicely (including Shivering Isles, an expansion about the size of Bloodmoon) and I still don't think I've seen everything yet.
 Now, there is no such thing as the perfect game, and Oblivion does have some flaws.  The graphical density and beauty does cause the Xbox to chug or even freeze momentarily.  It is disappointing that there are only about four voices in the game, so you encounter the same voice over and over again.  Maybe the developers spent all their voice actor money on Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean.  As for the downloadable content, aside from Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles, it mainly consists of ""money sinks""- basically, you find a place, then you spend thousands of gold pieces to bring the place back to life.  While the places you find are interesting, and have some neat and unique stuff in them, the format of these quests gets repetitive fast.  But in the overall scheme of things, these are minor complaints.  I mean, you're still doing unique things- like fighting undead pirates to take over their underground lair.  Oh, wait- the others are pretty much just find the lair, find the merchant that has the stuff for the lair, then hand over massive amounts of your hard earned gold.  Not exactly riveting stuff.  But Shivering Isles is a welcome change- introducing another massive area comparable to Morrowind's expansion Bloodmoon. Oblivion Review"
5.0	"My only problem with this game was that I felt it could have been slightly longer. Other than that it is amazing. So much more has been added and the campaign does truly stand out. Though it may be short, it really does make its mark. The multiplayer is also amazing. I'm not to thrilled about load-outs but I do highly enjoy the various modes and customization. My favorite would have to be infected with the flood. I have been waiting for something similar to that ever since firefight was created.

And to all those who are attempting to compare this to COD and giving it bad reviews for that reason, get your facts straight. First person shooter online multiplayer was first perfected by Halo 2. It was the first game to get it right. Everything after was built off of that, including COD. By saying that anything using customization is copying COD is completely foolish because many games have been using customization for quite some time. And if you do want to play that card then COD multiplayer is a copied off of Halo 2, so technically Halo 4 still uses what is common to the Halo franchise.

To everyone who enjoys FPS and still enjoys getting a great story from their game, I highly recommend. Slightly shorter but still Amazing"

The color is pretty true to the picture, maybe a bit more green and less yellow. Plastic is typical quality, feels fine when playing.

Overall, great product and I strongly reccomend it. A fantastic and solid GNC controller
5.0	"These games are awesome. I was a fan of God of War from the first game. Played #1 & #2 with infatuation. When I found this collection I thought to myself ""What the hell? Why not?"" I usually don't play spinoffs for other platforms (as these were originally made for the PSP system) but since these were made for the PS3 in this collection I dove in.
I'm very pleased that I did. The story lines are incredibly and consistent with the other God of War games. This really enhances the overall game-line! If you're a fan of the first two, then by all means PLAY this collection! Two Great Games"
5.0	I think its safe to say that this has turned out to be one of the most iconic games of its time despite its origin as a modification made to PAC-MAN by bored university students working on the school computers. There are several tweaks that you can turn on and off on this and also the NES or Super NES version. Its always fun to play the games on the old systems just to remember or see for the first time what it was like playing them years ago. Its also always fun to see the classic systems, cartridges and such and to hook up and work on them at least from time to time. One of my favorite things on here has always been the ability to add boost and resume from a higher level that you reached in the past rather than having to play threw the whole game from the beginning every time. Ms. PAC-MAN

5.0	"I purchased this game long ago after playing a demo for GTR1.  I didn't even have the computer to fully enjoy it. So, I built a rig and sim-pit just for this game.

To sum up what could eventually be a verbose review, GTR2 delivers where it matters most - racing realism.  That's not to say I have experience racing in race cars, but the immersion you get from the features GTR2 includes were outstanding for it's time.  It is now rather dated, while further iterations and more racing sims have been developed with more detail and variety.  It would be nice to see Simbin pair up with Polyphony Digital to produce a truly immersible experience.

With exception to graphics, this game has become the standard for a racing simulator.  Many hardcore sim-racers such as myself might think graphics represent a small factor in a racing simulator.  However, more detail and realism in the visual aspects draw you into feeling like you are there.

This is the best place to start for getting into racing simulation! Great for pure-sim."

5.0	"It's not everyday someone is attacked by a red demon that wears a diaper and fights by playing music with an ""axe"" that's an axe. It's not everyday a boy named U-1 - who has a dog named Puma that can change into a mechanical beast and is bonded molecularly to an instrument called a Gitaroo - one day discovers he is the legendary Gitaroo Man. And it's not everyday he has to battle enemies as bizarre as keyboard-playing UFOs and a disco-loving man in a giant bee suit. Sounds weird, huh? What's weirder is the fact that all of this actually makes sense once you start playing the game!
This is the world of ""Gitaroo Man"", one of the more interesting titles to arrive on American shores from Japan (and you thought things like this would forever remain hidden in the Land of the Rising Sun!). The game comes from Koei, the company famous for historical games such as the ""Kessen"" series. So how does Koei's foray into the musical genre hold? Thankfully, it holds up very well and is probably one of the better offerings of the genre!
As said before, you play U-1, aka Gitaroo Man, who must use his legendary Gitaroo to defeat enemies. This is done when he and his adversaries take turns playing music selections, which is actually attacking each other. The story borders on the lines of silliness, but it actually makes sense in the context of the gameplay. If you're familiar with games like ""Bust-a-Move"" and ""Dance Dance Revolution"", you'll understand at least part of this game. I said a ""part"" because in this game, the player uses not only the four action buttons but also the left analog stick. I won't go into detail about the control scheme, but I will say that it requires a lot of hand-eye coordinartion with both hands at the same time, concentration on the music beats and rhythms, and a lot of practice. So this game is not a mindless button-masher like ""Parappa the Rappa 2"". In fact, it's one of the most rewarding music games ever created. Players who finish this game will feel a sense of pride in mastering this incredibly fun title.
But what's a music game with great gameplay without good songs? Certainly not ""Gitaroo Man""! There haven't been songs this good since the first ""Bust-a-Move"", and there probably won't be for a long time. But if you're worried there's only mindless Japanese dance music in this game, fear not! This game has 10 levels filled with very differing music genres, including J-pop, disco-funk, electronica-reggae, rock-opera, and more! And virtually all the songs are teriffic, so a player is guaranteed to have at least several favorites.
And the voice acting is surpringly good. It's not as good as, say, ""Soul Reaver 2"" or even ""Silent Hill 2"", but it's still very well done. And considering Koei's other past attempts at voice acting *cough* ""Kessen II"" *cough* ""Gitaroo Man"" holds up very well.
Graphically, the style suits the game very well. The styles is very anime-ish, although it looks nothing like, say, ""Princess Mononoke"" or ""Cowboy Bebop""; the characters' heads are big compared to their bodies. But the graphics still work with the game, and there are no slowdowns or framerate issues to speak of. Lip-synching of voices can be little off or even non-existent, but again, it works with the quirkiness and style of the game.
And the replay value of the game? For most, it'll be through the roof. If you think the 10 levels of exciting music action are too easy, try the Master's Level, which features the exact same songs with more difficult gameplay. Believe me, they are hard. And considering the difficulty of the American version of this game was toned down from impossible to almost impossible, we shouldn't complain. Plus, gamers can try to get better scores on songs, which unlock hidden collectables. For completists, this game is a dream come true.
All in all, ""Gitaroo Man"" is undoubtedly worth a spot in any PS2 owner's collection. It seems quirky and very ""Japanese"" (and it is), but behind its oddball facade is very deep gameplay that has to be experienced by everyone. There is nothing like ""Gitaroo Man"", and there probably never will be again. It would be a shame for this ""niche"" game to be lost in the sea of quality PS2 titles, because this game definately has quality written all over it; you just have to look for it past its strangeness! One of the most innovative titles to ever be created."

5.0	"If you have somehow fallen asleep in the past few years in the video game department, let me fill you in. Super Smash Bros. was made to settle that age old argument of ""I think Link can beat the crud out of Mario"" ""Nuhuh"" ""Yahhuh"" This sequel to the original puts Nintendos trademark characters on the battle arena ready to duke it out. Special weapons, powerups and the occasional arena based obstruction will either help or hinder your quest at Smashdom. Special tournament mode will help  you work out matches to have a tournament with your friends. It's pick up and play multiplayer appeal makes it excellent for parties. In Melee, graphics have been greatly improved and many more secrets and extra characters have been added. My advice: An absolute necesssity for the gamecube Hands down the best multiplayer game for the system."
5.0	Very good product Thanks excellent seller
5.0	I was curious when i first heard about skype for the psp, so i read into it and let me tell you it does exactly what it says. You get to call any cell phone or land line like a house phone with your psp. They have deals where you can pay as you go or get a subscription, you can get unlimited calls for just 2.95 anywhere in the us and Canada. But to receive calls you have to buy a number which with a subscription is 30 a year. So its around 5 or 6 bucks a month to have a cell phone that uses wireless internet. so anytime there is wireless internet you get reception. This headset is good and light and works very very well. This is worth it.
5.0	"The creativity alone of this game warrants a five-star.  This game expresses the idea of convergence - that what you experience becomes a part of you.

But enough philosophical mumbo-jumbo, the actual game play is astoundingly fun/addictive as well.

Also the sound track is priceless - especially if you understand Japanese.  The lyrics are ridiculous... haha.  Nice variety of songs. Excellent game"
5.0	I used to think Tony Hawk 2 was the best game for the GBA. Not anymore...not since I bought this game!  The graphics are just simply incredible.  It looks much better than the SNES version.  And it has a BUNCH of levels.  My favorite one is the sky garden. And for those people who say GBA is hard to see, this game is BRIGHT!  You can see it much better than most games out for this little handheld.  Of course, visuals are not everything. The fun is also good.  The controls are easy to learn, and it's not too hard for it to be impossible.  The sound is very well done also.  This game is truely the best out of the 3.  It takes the levels, and coin system from Super Mario Kart, and takes the 3D shells and weapons and mixes them together.  And of course, you get the battle games!  One of the reasons I like it so much is because it's not in split screen.  The only thing I don't like about this game is that there isn't an option where you can play against the computer in battle mode, not many of my firends have this game yet. Best racer on the GBA...best game on the GBA!
5.0	This is the best WWF/E game THQ and YUKES has ever delivered. Later Smackdown games have proven to rather suck or be average or even horrible. This game was Yukes in their absolute prime. They need to take a lesson from the past with their newer WWE games, because just like WWE itself, the quality has gone down--A LOT! THQ's best WWF/E game of all time, comparible only to No Mercy from AKI on N64

5.0	"The Half-Life series without a shadow of doubt has a solid reputation of being one of the best FPS titles of all time, if not one of the best games of all time more generally. Valve's FPS classic will not disappoint for any who don't mind the dated graphics, and I highly recommend it. Despite the graphics, however, the game has remarkably good support for a game of its age and classic nature. It remains playable and downloadable once registered on Steam even to this day virtually without issue. Even though the graphics are dated and the game is quite old, the game has quite good support for a wide range of monitor resolutions - arguably better support for many widescreen monitors of today than many titles that have been released even very recently.

But with this set that isn't all you get! You also get the good old classic Counterstrike! Still widely played and enjoyed to this day much like the classic Half-Life, Counterstrike will provide you with hours of competitive online play on a wide variety of maps on the wonderful (and free!) Steam online service provided by Valve. Counterstrike and its sequel Counterstrike: Source are still among the most popular online FPS titles for the PC and have an incredible following of gamers who still regularly play these classic titles on Steam.

When I got my Half-Life Platinum set years ago, I mainly enjoyed Counterstrike, and I unfortunately made the mistake of giving up on Half-Life, only to find years later I was drawn back into the Half-Life series after having my view of the gaming world turned upside down by the FPS classic subsequently released by Valve known as Half-Life 2. Subsequently, realizing I just couldn't get enough Half-Life 2, I decided to go back and revisit the classic Half-Life to see if I had just overlooked its widely acclaimed quality as being one of the best games ever released. Boy am I glad I did! Unable to find my old Half-Life discs, I purchased the Half-Life Anthology set on Steam for the bargain price of around 14$, and realized the wonders of the Half-Life universe.

I would highly recommend all of the original Half-Life games to anyone interested in revisiting (or maybe just visiting for the first time!) one of the FPS genre's most enduring and timeless gaming franchises still enjoyed to this day. The Half-Life story and world is quite simply unrivaled in terms of its intriguing story and timeless gameplay, and is sure to remain an enduring classic for some time. 5/5 stars! Half-Life is Among the Top 2 FPS Titles of All Time"

5.0	"First of all, I've tried all of the Final Fantasy games and this is my favourite one of 'em all. I've never tried the nintendo version, but I do own the Origin version of the playstation, and I treasure it with all of my heart.
The Story:
The evil emperor is using his power to take over the realm, and to submit his evil influence in the world.
But not everybody will be bending to his will, and a group of freedom fighters escapes his malice and hords of dark riders.
Firion is the leader of the group, I have to say that his the least ineresting person in the game, Maria her brother Leon disspears after they've been captured, but only to rejoin 'em later in the game ""MUCH"" later. Guy, a strong man with a vital and private thought of ways. There's many other character's in the game, but you'll have to find out for yourself.
The Gameplay:
Fairly hard, the battle system is alot different and so is the way you gain levels, strenght, HP and MP.
Some of the bosses are also extremely hard to beat, I've spend many of hours trying to beat R.Soul for example.
There's many of random battles, but be sure not to go where you'r not supposed to, if you do so the monsters will outclass you by far. Chocobos are being introduced for the first time in the Final Fantasy series, and the chocobo melody has been used in many future Final Fantasy games.
The Music:
The best I've ever heard in any game, the world map theme is spendid, absolutely fantastic the most memorable melody of the entire Final Fantasy serie. Many of these tunes will also be used in many Final Fantasy games in the future, refering to the Chocobo theme, used in FF7. Many wonderful theme's, splendid.
The Graphics:
Fine, But the updated version for the playstation is alot better, it's been improved alot, many more colours are squared into the scene, and the battles are alot more lifelike, such as the mountains in the background with green grass fields on the side, There's also been made some fantastic FMV movies for the updated version, actually they've come to be some of the prettiest FMV that's out on todays playstation console.
All in All:
""THE BEST FINAL FANTASY GAME IN THE ENTIRE SERIE, THE COOLEST STORY, THE COOLEST CAST OF CHARACTERS, THE COOLEST MUSIC, AND THE COOLEST BATTLE SYTEM. I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT"" The Best"
5.0	Following the hectic gameplay trend of the series and the unbalanced character approach SSBWIIU is the game we hoped for and more even though it is far from perfect.  I should dock a star for the way the game gets stuck on the Wii screen when closing sometimes, or the way the sudden death is wildly unfair online and off, or the way the Amiibo character addition could have been a little more. What this game gets right is excessive fan service with the HUGE ST list, minigames, trophies etc.  The amaazing graphics and crisp control with more choices of controller than you can try, all of which work.  There are modes for single player, modes for multi are many and the use of trophies is innovative and addictive.  Terrific local multiplayer has my son and I at odds since release day.  An amazing an cult destined addition to a truly classic series. Supreme Smash
5.0	mouse works.  default buttons function w/o software (this is a deal breaker for me as i do install software beyond drivers).  in my experience this is better than a more expensive mouse that functions only with software running.  i will update should the device fail prematurely.  i recommend this item as value for money. works w/o software
5.0	It doesn't get any better. This game is one of the best if not the best game for Wii. You have more fun with this game then any other I can think of. Its not only great for kids its even more fun for adults. It is well worth the price - trust me, you will not be disappointed. Its outrageous fun destroying things and just playing this game period. Best Game For The Wii
5.0	"I love, love, love, this thing!
This little controller works on EVERY device I own including my PC. And, it fits right in my pocket.
Once you understand how to properly pair the controller with your device of choice, it works perfect.  It feels good in the hand, and is portable enough to fit in your edc(everyday carry) bag along with your tablet and other things. I highly recommend this controller to anyone who is interested.
8bitdo is also very good at releasing updates for this controller. You can even use it on the Wii now!  The flashing colorful indicator lights on this controller are attractive to the eyes but not distracting. Also, this little controller has the right amount of weight to it. This is not a cheap controller.
I would most definitely buy again. If you are a serious gamer on the go....BUY."
5.0	"I loved the original Armored Core games, and I love this one too!

The ability to tune my bots AI is a blast. Its fun to watch one revision of the bots AI lose in the fight, then make a few behavioral tweaks, and see it kick ass. This level of fine tuning means the possibilities are endless! If you're into strategy, just tweak the AI and properties of the bot, then run the game in AI mode.  If you're into action/fighters, then you can control the bot in the fight. Its something for everyone.

The game is complex, but intuitive. You should have no trouble picking up the mechanics without need for a tutorial or manual.

The sounds and graphics blew me away. Its really cool to put the psp on my large stereo and feel each explosion. Pisses off the neighbors to no end. XD

If you liked my review please rate it as helpful. Thank You! :D Awesome!"

5.0	"As many of you here, I was debating between this and the famous playseat; and again, as many of you here, I took into consideration a few factors about both the playseat and this wheel stand....and boy am I glad I chose this stand. A quick note before I go on, I have the Logitech GT wheel, make sure you buy the right stand for your wheel, there are different models.

First, the second your open the box, you'll notice how well packed this thing comes. The vendor takes extra care to make sure his product gets delivered intact. Shipping was also fast. I was given a UPS ground tracking number and in less than a week, I had my wheel stand. However, please note that delivery time will vary depending on your location, I live in CA and the wheel came from TX, so transit time was good....moving on....

The Package:
When you open it, you see this cool looking chrome & black folded stand. At first, I thought the black parts were made out of plastic..but to my surprise, THE ENTIRE STAND is made of STEEL. I picked it up and I was shocked, this thing is heavy and freaking sweet looking. Nice combo of chrome and semi-polished black. Perfect. I inspected the stand and noticed the heavy duty frame, I knew this thing was serious business and later on I realized I was right. The stand comes with rubber feet, well, they're not exactly feet, but more like thick rubber sleeves on all four open ends of the stand. This keeps the stand from slipping during gaming. I played mostly on hardwood floors and they served their purpose. The bottom rails of the stand, also have 3 rubber sleeves used to place the gas/brake pedals portion of the Logitech, to keep it from sliding up/down the frame of the stand and to also protect it from unwanted pressure and damage..more explained below.

What's Included:
You will get all the tools you'll need for the set up. Wrench, allen keys, sticky rubber feet for the top pedal plate, two plates to secure the pedals to the frame, instructions and two tie wraps that can and are meant to be used to afix all the cables to the frame/stand. Two tiewraps won't do the job, I used electrical tape instead, for a cleaner look. I took quite a few pictures for you guys to check out and you can view them above.

Set-Up:
The complete set up was easy. It took me around 20 minutes, 10 of which were my own for cable routing, etc. If you simply attach everything to the stand, it should take less than 10 minutes. Anyway, the stand has three adjustments, two are quick-release levers to open/close/angle the stand and to adjust the height. The non quick-release is right under the main plate, where the wheel goes, that needs to be adjusted with the included wrench and allen key. The adjustment of the wheel plate is for angle purposes.
The logitech wheel(GT in my case)goes on the main plate and you must use its clasps to secure it to the stand. The quick-release levers will be tight at first, but will losen up as you use them; they will of course NOT GET LOOSE while playing, the remain tight and secure, no matter what angle and height you set the stand at.

The gas/brake pedals are secured to the stand with the included top & bottom plates and the also included bolts. You simply place the pedals on top of the rubber sleeves to serve as both protection and friction to keep the pedals in place from sliding and protected from the metal frame and plates. Please make sure that the bottom plate is touching the MIDDLE RUBBER SLEEVE, this will increase the stability of the pedals and also protect them from the metal plate. To protect and also increase stability for the top pedal plate, the package includes TWO STICKY RUBBER circles, which must be glued to the bottom part of the TOP PLATE, to have contact with the Logitech pedals housing.

At this point, once your pedals and wheel are attached to the stand, you can call it quits or you can start routing the Logitech wheel's cables. I don't suggest you use the included two tiewraps, but instead, use electrical tape, this is not only easier, but creates a ""cleaner"" look to the entire set-up. Plus, the included tiewraps are not even close to being enough for the whole project. When it comes to the cable that goes to the connector on the wheel, make sure you leave enough cable or a loop, to compensate for when closing and collapsing the stand; this is very important to keep the cable from coming off its connection and to protect it from sudden, forceful tugs/pulls.

Performance:

Can start by saying wow?...well, WOW!!! This thing works beautifuly. The kids and I played GT all weekend, NOT ONCE did the stand show any signs of giving in nor did it lose its height/angle adjustments. It stayed put through out. Some of you may be worried about the main post, which is between your legs, well, to be honest, I did not notice it at all and most importantly, it did not affect or interfere with the racing experience. Using the brake/gas pedals was easy and uninterrupted. The best part of this stand is how it can be USED WITH ANY CHAIR, whatever your preference is. During our gaming session, the stand was sturdy, balanced and did not come loose. The Logitech wheel remained stable. Needless to say, ""this stand made the entire experience much more fun and natural"". I had no issues, none whatsoever. This stand is worth every penny.
The only issue I had, and THIS WAS NOT RELATED to the stand, was the Logitech's power cable, I have to figure a way out to keep it out of the way, a couple of times I stepped on it while putting my foot on the gas. This was mainly due to the fac that the only AC power outlet I had available was to my left and the power plug to the wheel is on the right. I may have to use an extension cord or free up an AC plug on my right.

Opening & Collapsin/Closing:

Easy and breezy....I left the wheel on the stand and plan to leave it there from now on. When we were done playing, I simply losen up the bottom quick release, moved the main post forward/down, then I losen up the height quick-release, lower it so it wouldn't stick too far out; then tighten up both quick-release and that's it! You can carry this puppy and put it away in a closet or under a high frame bed. When ready to play again, simply do the opposite, then adjust the angle and height, plug it and enjoy.

In Conclusion:

I had considered the bulkier, much more expensive, ""PlaySeat"" and even though, it looks very nice, it also has its drawbacks. The main, at least for me, its size. The fact that it can't be put away, is a big problem for me, at I'm sure for many of you. The playseat would be great for those whom have a ""man cave"" or a big ""gaming exclusive"" room; plus my wife would not let me have the playseat just laying around the living room/house. Not to metion, its price.
The wheel stand pro however, is perfect for my needs and costs half the price. It is well built with high quality materials and can be put away. It's adjustments are perfect and don't need ""extra kits"". It can be used with any chair and anywhere. The vendor is fast and reliable, I had doubts before buying the stand, they quickly responded and made my decision to purchase that much easier.
If you are thinking about buying this stand or have doubts, let me put your mind at ease...this stand is awesome. It works, it's strong, sturdy and made to last. It has paid itself off with its convenience, great flexibility, quality and most of all, performance. A great purchase.

A word to the vendor: Thank you for such an outstanding, high quality product, but please, if you are going to include tiewraps, include a bunch of them, not just 2. It makes you look kinda cheap. High Quality. Sturdy. Strong. More Practical Than PlaySeat."

5.0	"I keep worrying that Castlevania is going to run out of steam soon, and every time I pick up the latest 3D installment my worst fears are confirmed, but then I pick up the 2D sidescrollers that I have been most worried about and find myself relieved.

  Very little has changed by way of overall game play style. The game still plays like a medieval Metroid, similar to the classic Symphony of the night, but where as the 3D Castlevanias feel stale, and tired somehow the GBA (and now graduating to the NDS) games have managed to remain fresh, and wonderful for more than 5 games in a row even though the core game play has remained unchanged.

 Dawn of Sorrow may have a bit of an odd name, lie its predecessor it's not really an emotional story, but one thing that it does have over Castlevanias of yore, your character, Soma, IS Dracula (reincarnated), and I thought playing Dracula's son was neat. The story isn't very deep, or involved, but the characters therein are still quite cool, and there is just enough story to keep you playing for the 8-12 hours it'll take to complete the main quest. Additionally, one advantage CVDS has over Aria of Sorrow, is that this one is quite challenging, where as AoS was a little on the easy side. Best of all the game features a new weapon synthesis system, which enables you to combine weapons with the souls Soma has stolen to create a new and more powerful weapon. I ended up getting the Grim Reaper's scythe, which, while slow, is insanely powerful. It's quite cool.

  Additionally the level designs are quite intuitive, and beautiful. The game incorporates a number of tricks to give the appearance of a depth that I haven't noticed in a side scroller before. It makes me wonder what a 2D side-scroller could do on a next gen system. On top on that, the game also has some of the finest graphics I have seen in a side scroller with very little aliasing, and no grain to the DS picture.

  Another innovation I appreciated was the ability to see the castle map on the top screen, which helped keep the action more consistent rather than breaking it up the way past installments did any time you needed to look at the map.

  This game also features the best alternative play mode, which allows you to play as Julius Belmont, Yoko, and Alucard, regretfully, however, this mode does not permit for the player to collect or purchase healing items, which would be tremendously helpful when up against some of the game's tuff bosses.

  In all, however, this game is the 2nd best 2D Castlevania to date, and the 1st game that has made me pick up my DS again (after both my DS and my PSP have been collecting dust for a while) and thankfully this game seems to have ushered in a flood of must have games for the system, as it was the first of a huge handful of new titles for the handheld that I've picked up over the last few weeks.

 If you had previously dismissed the DS as a viable handheld, this is the game that will change your mind! Castlevania at it's best"
5.0	Great price for a trip down memory lane! Fantastic trip down memory lane!
5.0	"I have to say this is by far the best Resident Evil up to date. And the year is now 2016, so that is saying a LOT!.
Let's start with the story itself. For me it's the greatest. While it remained simple, it still manages to maintain very well entertained and makes you keep wondering what's gonna happen next. The game start off with an awesome (back then the graphics were awesome) opening/intro where you see pretty much the zombies kicking some soldiers ' ass (or eating) and completely overwhelming the humans trying to stop them. the police an special forces are killed by the zombie army. This leaves the Raccoon City's last hope completely defeated.
And so, from this point, and with the city infested by the waking dead, we have our hero Jill Valentine enter the story. And the adventure begins.
You will begin breaking your way through the life-less streets of Raccoon City. you will encounter various different threats, each enemy very different than the last. If you are playing the HARD mode like a true fan, then you will have to be very smart when choosing which enemies you actually have to kill, and which you can just avoid. This will help you save your precious (and very scarce) ammunition.
During your visit at Raccoon city you will encounter, what many call the best RE boss (and they are right, of course): T- type Tyrant code named Nemesis. Be ready, because this BIG guy will make you know the true meaning of the word ""HORROR"" as he will follow you to every room and stage you go. He is relentless and almost invincible. So, make sure you save your best weapons and cures for every encounter with this guy. If you think you are up for the challenge, I strongly advise you to fight him every time you come face to face with him a every time you succesfully defeat him, he will drop special cases with useful items you can use later on to help you make up for whatever you loss during your fight with him.
The soundtrack of the game is the best by Misami Ueda and others. It will give you the chills at the right moments. While navigating the empty streets of RC the soundtrack also gives you that feeling of solitude and that at any moment something can come up jumping at you from every corner or any hole in the ground. My personal favorite is the song at the fianal battle with the Nemesis, which by the way is SOOOO EPPICCCC!!!! ( I have it on my phone... :)..the name of the song is called ""Nemesis Final Metamorphosis"")
All in all, I can say you can't go wrong on this purchase. This is by far the best RE classic. You won't regret. I have to say this is by far the best Resident Evil up to date"
5.0	Looks great on the shelf and with games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Maker makes for a great use Looks great on the shelf and with games like Legend of ...
5.0	"The Nintendo 3DS is very much still in its infancy but just within its first 3 months in the US market, the platform has already hosted a few high profile fighting game appearances. Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition, BlazBlue: Continuum Shift 2 3D, and this one, Dead or Alive Dimensions. Both BlazBlue & DoA make their Nintendo debuts. With the power of the 3DS system and its unique ability to display stereoscopic 3D glasses free, 3rd party developers are approaching Nintendo's newest portable with open arms and giving the system the type of games that have never been seen on a Nintendo portable. I personally find it to be a golden age as I'm finally getting to play more ""hardcore"" games on a console with Nintendo's franchises side by side.

For its first foray on to a Nintendo console, Dead or Alive Dimensions takes the series' trademark frantically fast and frenetic fighting gameplay on to the palm of your hands with a title that serves as your passport to DoA's world. Dimensions is not a sequel but rather an encyclopedic entry that explores the stories and events of the first four DoA games. A total of 26 combatants are playable in this installment making it the largest cast in the series' history. For the first time, all boss characters from 1-4 are playable. Though its obvious that a few concessions had to be made especially with regards to Nicole from part 4 as she is Halo inspired, Dimensions is still your guide pass to the DoA universe.

Dimensions did some things a little different to its impressive roster of single player modes. For example, Arcade Mode is really more of a time attack mode where you pick a course with a predetermined set of opponents on a race to beat the best time. There is no story mode for every character, instead, you get a mode called Chronicle which is the game's main single player campaign. Chronicle tells the stories of the four Dead or Alive Tournaments through various cut scenes, dialogue sequences, and cinematics. As crazy as the characters and their situations are, the story is told rather poorly and comically which will lead to more questions than answers. The voice acting is pretty cheesy but some of the action sequences are pretty awesome (love the scene where Hayate kills a bunch of DOATEC soldiers, lots of blood and gore hehe). If anything, Chronicle is perfect for DoA newbies as it also explains the gameplay mechanics from performing basic combos, executing the franchises' famous counter system, and using environments to your advantage.

Translating the gameplay from console to portable is spot on here. The controls are easy to learn, you have four main buttons, one for punch, kick, guard, and throw. Combinations of buttons are very rare here, just more on manipulating your body in tandem with the four main buttons. Though DoA is not as fleshed out as say Tekken or Virtua Fighter, DoA's real hook is on how you can master the counter system. The vast majority of moves a fighter has in this game can be countered in a display of lighting quick reflexes. Holding the guard button in sequence with a directional pad is all it takes to perform the counter. The trick to it however is guessing whether the landing hit is a high, low, or medium. The hardest CPU levels have a high frequency of guessing your moves in turn with the CPU performing a devastating counter and performing the more challenging combo moves. Another feature of the DoA franchises are its great stage designs. You won't find any bland plain stages a la Tekken/Soul Calibur here. The highlight as always are the multi-tiered stages where you can push off enemies from higher ground to a ravine below. Environmental traps such as electric walls and a special stage taken from Metroid Other M has the menacing Ridley shooting fireballs at the combatants and will do serious damage to any fighter who happens to fall out of the ring.

With 26 playable characters, you'll find many favorite characters to use in DoA Dimensions. Characters specializing in ninjutsu are more of your ninja type characters such as Kasumi, Ayane, Ryu, and Hayate, quick and agile they strike at a more rapid rate. Gen Fu, Leifang, Eliot, and Jann Lee are more of your traditional Chinese martial arts fighters, not as fast as the ninjutsu characters but have more concentrated strikes. For expert grapplers, Tina, Bass, and La Mariposa are experts at grappling combos which are very strong attacks. As noted you can play all the boss characters so you can finally pull off some of their most frightening moves. Each character has an insane amount of moves to perform. Just like in Super Street Fighter IV 3D, you can use the touch pad of the 3DS to use a move. Though its not as useful as SSFIV's, you'll probably use the touch pad trying to frantically activate a counter move instead.

The graphics in Dimensions are quite stunning. The 3D effect adds a deep sense of immersion but the framerate runs at half speed as opposed to switching the 3D off. Some claim 30 frames is pretty unplayable, I leave the 3D effect on as I bought the 3DS for its cool 3D features. The stages are mostly taken from DoA 3&4 and have been translated quite well. There is still quite a lot of sex appeal here with the lady characters but the jiggly breasts from previous titles have been toned down a bit, so sorry, if you were expecting jello boobs in 3D, they're more realistic here. Character models retain their look quite well with a daily dose of free DLC content for costumes. I've had this game since day one and every day I get a new costume to use. Load times are non-existent. I haven't played much online but the game is pretty laggy online. You will need another copy of the game to play with 2 3DS systems offline.

Dead or Alive Dimensions is my favorite game on the 3DS so far (Ocarina of Time 3D a very close second). This is a game full of content even if you're content on playing the game solo 99% of the time. With the fun, fast, gameplay, rich graphics, daily free DLC, this shall remain my favorite fighting game on the system. It will be for you as well, I guarantee. As the announcer says if you win a match with 2 rounds with perfect health, GREATEST!"
5.0	It's a multiplayer-focused Sonic game continuing off of the story set in the Sonic Adventure games and the GameCube version in specific does its job the best between itself, the PS2 and the Xbox. For a multiplayer-focused Sonic game, it's great!

5.0	Geat game has Five Stars
5.0	"I tend to think of this title less as a zombie game and more as a puzzle game with zombies in it. The difficulty has been ratcheted up considerably from the Playstation original, the puzzles have been changed around, the extreme cheese factor has been dialed down, (No more, ""It might be helpful if you, THE MASTER OF UNLOCKING, take it with you!"") and by comparison, the graphics are gorgeous. The lighting effects have really upped the creep factor as well. If you have a GameCube, do yourself a solid and pick up this title. A GameCube essential."
5.0	This game is rare to find i heard that could be why its almost $200 but anyway the gameplay is a basicly 3rd person rpg shooter you go around shooting enemys and picking up new guns as you go along and learn new spells, you find out the enemys are really used to be like rats etc. but what hooks you is the story line, i don't want to spoil the game but the feel of the game and the story makes this game really stand out its almost like your playing a movie on a playstation ! One word masterpiece

5.0	"Xbox live subscriptions are sold almost anywhere, even at some gas stations. This is the best price you will find, unless you get some kind of black friday deal or special sale. I also recommend you buy 12 months at a time (in ""bulk"") as the 3 or 6-month options will cost you more in the long run. That's logic! This is the best price you will find"
5.0	"I enjoy this game to an unbelievable degree. It makes extremely good use of the Wii controller and nunchuck.

Multiplayer is fun and addictive.

Single player is also addictive and offers enough variation that it makes you  want to keep on playing.

We have put over 10 solid (and I mean solid) hours of game time in on this game and we're about 3/4 of the way through. A Must Have Launch Title"
5.0	"Let me start by saying I LOVE THIS SERIES! i have played the Diablo games since the first one in the set!! I know a lot of people were disappointed with this installment of the series, but i actually really enjoyed it! I mean I'm no hardcore player and decided to play a monk and i made it though nightmare into the beginning of Hell mode and i was really pulled into the game, and the story. Although i did think that the game itself felt a little short in terms of the length of the story, but that doesn't have any effect on the rating i'm still giving this Collector's Edition.

Aside from the actual game, I gave the 5 star rating for the actual Collector's Edition aspect!
Firstly, I was really happy by the size of the Collector's Box the product came in! A bit deceiving by the outside in comparison to the products in the box but no negative there! The box itself it very neatly designed, very detailed and nicely textured! Now to the good stuff on the inside! As soon as you open it, you are welcomed by tons of goodies! There's an Art book featuring 207 pages. The book is very detailed and full of amazing art any Diablo fan would appreciate! Its a very nice quality art with a very sturdy cover! Next you get a couple of Guest Passes for Diablo III and one for World of Warcraft. You get a Behind the scenes DVD packed with over an hour of interviews, Commentary and so on! Next you get a cool soundtrack featuring 23 songs in a neat little case! next and which is probably my most favorite is the Diablo skull and USB soulstone! The skull is a nice collector's piece which sits nicely and holds the USB in the center of the skull and is loaded with Diablo II and the expansion Diablo II Lord of Destruction! It also comes in a nicely designed and texture box and is packed very nicely with material to keep the skull and USB from moving and breaking. Then lastly it comes with a few in game content that you can enjoy while playing the game! (also a pet for WoW)  :D

I think all in all this a very well thought out Collector's edition its got at least one thing to impress a fan, if not the whole bunch of goodies the box is full of! I understand the price has gone up since I got mine, but I still think if you are a big fan of the series its worth picking up because you won't be disappointed! At least if you don't like the actual game you'll love the items within! :D Personally I love it!"

5.0	"The first thing to know about Walk It Out is that it's not a ""video game"" in the traditional sense of the word. There are no puzzles to solve, no targets to shoot at, no time limits, and no levels to conquer.

What it is is a stunningly rich and deep virtual environment where you walk, and walk, and walk. The virtual world is a beautifully drawn cartoon world, with parks, beaches, ocean views, buildings, bridges, and trees. The time in the virtual world matches real world time: during the day you can admire the vast blue skies with beautiful cloud formations; at night, you can walk under a stunningly beautiful starry sky.

The way the game works, a soundtrack will play catchy music continuously in the background, and you simply have to step precisely to the beat. Each time you hit the beat perfectly, you get a ""chip"". Miss the beat, and you get ""chips"" deducted.

You can choose one of two options for a controller: a Wii Balance Board or a Dance Dance Revolution Pad. I found both to be very responsive as far as detecting my foot movements, although I preferred the DDR dance pad because it gave me more options of where to put my feet (unlike DDR, it doesn't matter where on the dance pad you put your feet, as long as you step to the rhythm). If you don't have either, you can always use a Wii remote and a nunchuk, although you'll be giving your arms a workout instead of walking. In any case, you can also use the Wii remote to look around as you're walking.

After you earn enough chips, you can use them to unlock different things in the game. You can unlock up to 120 new songs (some from well-known artists like Demi Lovato and The Black Eyed Peas), 69 route branches (to open up new roads), 3346 town elements (items ranging from trees and street signs to suspension bridges, 24 magical clocks (to allow you to change the in-game time), 12 zodiac signs (to build constellations in the night sky), and 7 rainbow spheres (to build a rainbow in the daylight).

If you've played games like Super Mario Bros or Lego Indiana Jones, you know that it's addictive to collect coins in a game. And I admit, it is really addictive to collect as many chips as possible to unlock as much of your world as you can. It was a brilliant move on the part of Konami to take such addictive concepts in video games and combine them with walking--you have so much fun exploring and unlocking your picturesque virtual world, you don't really care that you spent an hour stepping just to get enough points to do so.

You can save your progress any time, and a status screen will tell you how much of the map and how many things you unlocked, how many calories you burned, and how many actual miles you walked.

In many ways, Konami was brilliant to focus just on walking as exercise. While it seems there are dozens of Wii exercise titles that all do the same old calisthenics, boxing and running exercises, Konami decided to focus on a popular area of exercise that's untapped. Studies that show that sustained walking is one of the very best forms of exercise there is, and 67 million Americans walk regularly for exercise, whether as step exercises, walking on a treadmill, or just strolling outdoors.

If you've ever tried walking for exercise, you know it can get a bit boring. But Konami has done a great job in making it fun. If you, like me, have ever been bored to tears walking on a treadmill and staring into space, this is the game for you. While it's not the end all and be all of exercise games, it'll certainly provide you some good aerobic exercise and will make a great addition to any Wii fitness routine. Konami hits a home run. Great alternative to treadmills and step classes."
5.0	As described, good quality, works good, fast shipping, played game with no issues. Happy with purchase!
5.0	"With the next generation of Gaming Godzilla games weren't anywhere till Atari wanted their own Godzilla games for their own in which Both Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube were the next game systems as the PlayStation 2 release was cancelled.
With that said lets begin this game story
What theres a plot in this fighting Game? Anyway lets play the Xbox Version.
Plot/Story: The plot involves an alien race known as the Vortaak invading the Earth and assuming control of the planet's giant monsters, sending them to attack cities across the globe. One monster breaks free from the Vortaak's control, and battles the other monsters in order to drive off the Vortaak.
So a basic plot but not bad.
Gameplay: The player plays as a one of several giant monsters (eleven playable characters: Anguirus, Destoroyah, Gigan, Godzilla 90s, Godzilla 2000, King Ghidorah, Mecha-King Ghidorah, Megalon, Orga, Rodan, and Mechagodzilla). Via punches, kicks, and limb attacks (usually a tail-attack), each monster can attack others and also use their surroundings. Army forces (missile and ""freeze"" tanks) and the monster Hedorah (which slows a monster's energy regeneration ability) are also present and sporadically attack all monsters. Extras include bonus orbs, which can provide a finishing move or summon the monster Mothra for an airstrike. Extra features include choice of several locations, and a ""destruction"" mode (in which players compete to destroy buildings in a city) and ""melee"" mode (in which up to four players can compete simultaneously).
Music: The music is good with Akira Ifukubes Godzilla theme for the credits.
The US version of the GameCube version has Mechagodzilla 2, while the Japanese version has Mechagodzilla 3 (Kiryu). The Xbox version (only released in the US) contains both versions of Mechagodzilla, improved graphics, two new fighting arenas (Boxing Ring, Vortaak Homeworld) and custom soundtracks.
The items are really good for this game including the gallery which contains poster of some of the Godzilla films.
Story 4/5 Gameplay 4.5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9/10 = A-
A great for this series but has flaws. Godzilla monster mayhem"
5.0	Been playing this for some time now.  This is a great RPG--the controls are clean, and battle has a lot of variety in the moves and the weapons.  The artwork is fantastic--rarely seen in any games up til now.  The story line is engaging, and the great number of quests, main and side, make this a really fun game to play.  There was an initial problem on startup in Windows 8.1, but the solution was posted online and worked out well.  Overall, a fun time. Colorful, smooth and fun.  Well worth the time and money.
5.0	I love the realistic damage and the crazy ways you can race in this game. The only downside is it's difficult to race multiple opponents without getting knocked off the track, as is most race games, where the AI is pretty aggressive. The best thing about this game is watching the driver fly out of the car in certain crashes, as well as the bonus games. I've even run over my driver with my own car, which I've never done in any racing game before. A real good racing game!
5.0	"Cheap low end mouse.  But it is VERY viable for gaming.  Easily the best cheap mouse I have ever owned.  I have had mine for 4+ years now and it gets used A LOT.  I am a pretty serious gamer and use it 5+ hours a day.  It has started to wear down and the scroll wheel click no longer works but I can not complain.  It has had thousands of hours put into it.  I prefer this mouse over some of my more expensive ""gaming"" mice that I have.  I will be purchasing another one very soon.  Do not over look this because it is a cheap mouse!!!!!! Best cheap mouse you will ever use."
5.0	OK OK
5.0	The Golden Sun Franchise is awesome! This DS one is great as well. Pretty cool to see the main character of the first one with a beard! Cool DS variant of the Golden Sun Franchise!
5.0	"The wii is a great console! It has games that appeals to ALL ages. Even to the serious gamers. There are over 20 Mature rated games for wii, and there are still more Mature rated games to come. Over 80 Teen rated games, with more Teen rated games to come. There are over 900 games for wii, there are less than ten titles that involve Mario. Whoever thinks the wii games are all just about Mario, know nothing about the wii and its games. The wii offers online gaming that allows you to play certain games against people around the world! The only downside to online gaming of the wii is the friend code thing.

  In the package will be (of course) the wii, a wii remote, nunchuk, wii sports game, and a bunch of setup and instruction manuals. The wii looks like it was made by the same designs as the DS Lite. They are both very apple inspired. Now about the channels. I love the mii channel! On the mii channel you can customize yourself so you can use your character in certain games. You can customize other people too! I even customized some of the people I go to school with! The Virtual Console is probably the best feature included with the wii. You can download old school games. Like from NESS, SNESS, sega genesis, neo games, super nintendo, and N64. I was so excited to be able to download the super Nintendo games I used to play when I was 3, and the N64 games I used to play when I was 6! In order to download the games you need wii points, you can purchase points off your wii using a credit card or visa OR you can buy a 2000pts card at any retail store. A wii classic controller will be needed. You'll find the virtual console on the wii shop channel. The News channel, you can see old and new news reports from all over the world. The weather channel, you can check the week's weather of where you live, and the weather of countries all over the world! Oh, and of course the photo channel. You can view photos and movies saved to your wii message board, digital camera, or cell phone. It requires an SD card though. I don't know much about it because I don't use this feature. You can serf the web on the wii, you have to purchase internet off the wii shop channel for 500 wii points. One more important thing is, in order to be able to on the New channel, weather channel, and wii shop channel, and of course to be able to do online gaming, you need a wireless connection to the internet. If you don't have wireless connection, you have to buy a LAN adapter. You can find one on this site, but I recommend you buy it from Nintendo.com, that's where I bought mine.

  Wii is the next generation console. The wii remote is what make the wii  the next generation console. When your playing a sports game like tennis, bowling, boxing, pool, and golf it seems like your actually playing in real life! There is even a sports pack that comes with, boxing gloves, tennis racket, golf club, and a bunch of other stuff to make the experience realistic. The wii wheel makes racing games like Mario Kart a lot of fun. Like the ps3 and PSP, you can use the DS Lite as a controller for wii on certain games. I think on the Pokemon games. The wii has excellent graphics. There little better than the game cube. They may not be as great as the graphics on the PS3 and 360, but there certainly pretty impressive. Graphics aren't everything, its game play that matters. What's the point of a game looking realistic if it sucks.

  If your a casual gamer I recommend Wii play, Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros Brawl, Mario Galaxy, Super Paper Mario, Sims 2 Castaway, Rayman raving rabbids 1 & 2, the legend of Zelda twighlight Princess, cooking mama, and many more. If your a hardcore gamer I recommend Rock Band, Guitar Hero, No more heroes, mortal kombat, resident evil, the god father, call of duty, and many more! As you know wii sports is a game that comes free with the wii. You get to play golf, baseball, bowling, tennis, and boxing. You play as your mii in wii sports and wii play.

  Thats my review on the Wii. I hope it helps. Oh, and please ignore the people who say wii is a baby console, those people know nothing about the wii and probably never played one. People don't camp out in front of the store for it for nothing. I recommend this product for anyone, but even though there are a lot of hardcore games for wii, if you plan on buying nothing but super hard core games, I recommend the PS3 or 360. But if your a mixture of both hardcore and casualty, the wii is for you. Good luck! Nintendo Revolution"
5.0	"Despite all of the positive reviews for this game, I was still skeptical of a new game on the PS-3 done by Sega with an unknown RPG hybrid. I couldn't have been more pleased with the purchase.

PROS:
*Incredibly unique pencil-drawn artwork. Although I've seen some complaints about the resolution max, the style more than makes up for the relative pixel shortages.
*Battle strategies are somewhat open-ended allowing for customization of approach.
*Characters are engaging and likeable. I actually felt sorry when any of my soldiers died.
*Story line is interesting and MOST IMPORTANTLY you can skip through the more tired anime sequences by pressing START.
*Classes of characters allow for interesting combinations on the field. Some classes such as the scout and sniper seem weak in the beginning but gradually become essential to efficient battle
*Difficulty is just hard enough to be challenging but not so tedious as to prove frustrating
*Appropriate for teens and adults. I do not agree with another reviewer that this game is ""for kids"" as it does require a good amount of patience and initial discomfort with the first-of-its kind battle sequences. Once adapted, though, the fighting method is very user-friendly and consistent.
*Ability to save the game in the middle of a battle. Very helpful with battles that can last an hour tops until you perfect your strategy.

CONS:
*The story is a *little* corny. I can see why a hard-core War Gamer would find it cheesy, but w/ a lot of Japanese RPG's you just take as a given that somebody's bakin' pies.
*It would be nice to customize characters more. Although you do gain some special weapons, unique uber weapons and armor/uniforms would be cool to add to your #1 squad.
*Replay once the game is completed could offer more unique options than once skirmish battle. Going for all ""A's"" loses intrinsic motivation after a while.

Overall, this game has offered the most enjoyable experience I have had on the PS3. Hopefully Sega is reading these reviews and will get to work pronto on a sequel. Best strategy-RPG since FF Tactics"
5.0	Works just fine and charges quickly. Great
5.0	We boguht it for my Son's Bithday  He loves it  We also bought World 3 but some one stold it so got to replace it Got it for my Son's Birthday
5.0	great game would recommend
5.0	It is great to try to collect all of the Sims 2 games. I mean, if you play the Sims 2, you simply need to get the extra stuff. University has a lot of cool teen stuff. My favorite, however, is the Sims Pets and Apartment life. I love the Sims!
5.0	First thing to remember is that this is a Dragon Quest game at heart! Sure the game has Dynasty Warriors action but it is so much deeper than that with such features as a armor system, weapons system, magic skills, organizing a party, adjusting stats, light tower defense system via monster coins, etc. Really loving this game for how immersive and fun it is. The world FEELS like Dragon Quest! The classic DQ tracks as well as the bright colorful world, characters and monsters that feels like its straight from Akira Toriyamas mind. Support this game guys, it's a fun game and definitely worth picking up. Really loving this game for how immersive and fun it is
5.0	"Quality build on the figure: the paint job is excellent down to the little dot/mole  on her cheek.

The facial features are very detailed despite the little surface area with nice paint job on the eyes and eyebrows

The figure is propped up with a stand her right leg lean against which provide great stability

The figure is also compatible with a lot of Nintendo games, but all of them at the moment only deliver cosmetic changes to the game except for the Super Smash Bros Wii and 3DS games where you can level up the character and create a ghost profile to battle against

Current compatible games are:
Super Smash Bros
Yoshi Woolly World
Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash
Super Mario Maker
amiibo tap: Nintendo's Greatest Bits
Mario Party 10
ACE COMBAT Assault Horizon Legacy +
Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker
Hyrule Warriors

Overall great buy if you're a collector or a fan of Zero Suit Samus Detailed Figure"
5.0	This is a good game but it is not the best. It is similar to the first one but the graphics are better in this one. It has great graphics for the people and guns. It takes place in Europe but one place is in south Africa and there is allot missions to go to and they are really fun to replay and understand more. The multiplayer mode is fun but not near as good as MOHRS because it is one on one and can be four people, and there are not many places to go to. This is a fun game on single player and it is fun to go back and replay the missions. Sorry it is not very helpful or long but that is all there is to say about it. Missions are hard to beat and can be confusing but, i got the hang of it, some i beat in the first try but most i had to play at least 10 times before i could beat it. It gets annoying becasue it has the rehealth yourself thing and revive's and if you use them well is the trick to beat it. After you do die, you don't start over at the last checkpoint like Medal Of Honor Vanguard you restart the whole mission which gets very annoying. Its ok...No its AMAZING
5.0	"The game is fun and so far I haven't run into any glitches. The only one I'm experiencing from other expansions is not being able to hold relationships. I save while they are married and when I come back the next day, they are just friends. But everything else saves.

I wouldn't purchase it from Amazon though. Their digital download takes way longer then EAStore/Origin's site. And it's failed three times before working properly.

And there's nothing wrong with purchasing digital download, if you do it from the right place. Never had an issues with it from Direct2Drive and EaStore. Purchased games over 3 years ago and they are still there. They will never go away. Would never buy a physical disk again. All that money I put down for disks Sims 1-2, many expansions, and many moves later, they all scratched up and all the booklets with activations codes are gone. Amazon is cheaper but honestly I'd like all my games in the same downloader. Next time I'll just purchase from EAStore/Origin. Fun game but...."
5.0	No coment Five Stars
5.0	spent so many hours in this game - has severe re-playability and I've re-played it several time. hundreds of hours into this. love the DLC's as well for this game its fallout - nuff said
5.0	Well, the Advance games remedied that, but they didn't quite have the scope and balance of the original sonic games. Yes, they were fast, but they were also ... kind of small feeling. They felt like portable versions of sonic games. They were good, but I always preferred the old-school Sonic games as the real achievements. hack link
5.0	Got this for the pet and also wanted this much cartel coins also so it was a win win Five Stars
5.0	"Awesome game. Good story line.  Decent graphics.
Should come with a warning label: Playing this game
may become addictive. Awesome game. Good story line"
5.0	I use this to hook my Xbox One controller up to my PC and game. It works great and is easy to use. Worth the money
5.0	"I rating 5 because it's so amazing
I enjoy like it awesome a story and hack your phone is everything a city!
I would recommend this watch_dog for us. Watch Dogs limited Edition"
5.0	This game is a cool new spin on the pokemon series its really cool. is a must for all pokemon lovers. Cool New spin
5.0	"Well, I'm a little embarrassed to say that I just got a Dreamcast about a week ago,but still have vivid memories of all the commercials that were played and watching my babysitter at the time play it constantly until the PS2 came out. I'm going to review the system in parts because there is just so much to cover that it needs to be broken down.

The System: The Dreamcast itself is very small,it's not as long as the original PS1 but it sits a little bit higher. Overall it looks very nice,Pictures don't do it justice,it needs to be seen in person. The Dreamcast's power light is also very unique,instead of being the usual green color,its orange (it's supposedly a very lucky color in Japan.) It also has 4 controller ports,and the usual hookup plugs in the back.

The Controller: The controller is sort of a hit and miss,it looks really cool. But it's lacking in the button department,it has 4 face buttons,one analog stick,D-pad,and 2 triggers. Now the problem is the Dreamcast controller needed either another analog stick or 2 more shoulder buttons. I have a very good feeling if the Dreamcast would have been in the market longer it would have seen a redesigned controller. Not the worst controller,but not the best,It gets bonus points for possibly being the coolest looking controller I've seen.

The Visual Memory Unit (VMU): The VMU is quite possibly the most unique memory card I have ever seen,it has a screen a D-Pad,sleep button,mode button,and 2 face buttons. While your playing a game it displays either what game your playing,your health,or to choose plays in football,every game does different things. Some games even have mini games you can download onto the VMU. There are some downsides to the VMU and the number one thing is battery life,it takes 2 watch batteries that cost $5 a piece,here is the kicker,they don't last long at all! It would have been smarter to just make the VMU use 2 AA batteries instead,they are much cheaper and would have probably lasted longer (rechargeable would have lasted much longer). And the number 2 downside is the memory on the card is small! Only 200KB available for use (there is a way to unlock 44KB more) if your playing a sport game it can take as much as 164KB! Most games will only use 4-60KB's depending.

Games:This is a high point for the DC,at the time it had some of the best games for all genres listing them all would take up way to much space. It is unfortunate that most of the Dreamcasts best games have been ported to either PS2,Xbox,or GC. But there is something about playing the original that makes the games seem so much better on Dreamcast. I'm going to list the pros and cons of the system:

Pros:

+You can still buy NEW Dreamcasts for $100
+Controllers/VMU's are a dime a dozen
+Games are cheap and can still be bought NEW
+Very nice design
+Reliable as long as you play legit software (Tip:CD-R's will burn out your Dreamcast laser)
+Awesome memory card

Cons:

-VMU's use expensive batteries that don't last
-Controller needs more buttons Sega's Best System Ever!"
5.0	"For a lot of us, Nintendo is another family member. Whether he's an immediate family member or a distant cousin is decided upon how much we adore the franchises they've brought to us. Ultimately, they play some part in our life. So when Nintendo decided to bring back Super Mario to one of his most basic forms on the Nintendo DS, we rejoiced. But now we rejoice for a new reason. New Super Mario Bros. Wii is all that is good in an older Super Mario Bros. adventure, complete with a kidnapped princess, world map, suits, Koopa bosses, and side-scroll platforming.

New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a throw back to all that was great from Super Mario Bros. 3. As mentioned, the suits are back, as well as the Koopa kid bosses. The suits are a particular fun way to change up the pace of the game, and never a true necessity, aside from the occasional mushroom. And the Koopa kids, well, they're just a blast from the 90's past. Essentially, this is a title meant to appease the gamers from that generation, and bring a new level of appreciation to the side-scrolling platform games. But how does it fair?

And it fairs really well. From start to finish, the game continues to entertain while not punishing the player(s) for getting to the end. This is also one of the rare gems from this generation of gaming that truly gets what co-op is all about. Of course, that would be trying to kill your friends off before the end of that stage. Playing with friends in the game seems to be a game within itself. Not only for the co-op killing that will eventually happen, but the pleasure of being accompanied on the adventure is a true treat.

The game is setup in a 2.5D perspective. This means while the game is actually 3D, you still are running down a line to reach an ending. It really feels retro, which is what Nintendo was shooting for. The game works best this way anyway since they've included a 4-player co-op mode. The music and sounds are very retro too, which means this game truly is a blast from the past.

The core of the series is here still, with all the tricky jumps, moving platforms, and all of our favorite classic enemies. Not to mention the wall sliding/jumping ability brought to us in New Super Mario Bros. on the DS. There's also a secondary objective to each level, similar to those of Super Mario World. Remember the Yoshi coins? They're back. Collecting them all will lead you to a special world for the more experienced Super Mario players. The best part about each level design is that you'll want to go back and replay them, just to make sure you didn't miss something, or just to see if you can master a speed run. This is truly the same Mario we've grown to love, which means it's the same game we've played before. There's nothing truly new or ground breaking. It doesn't even push Super Mario games to the next level of creativity. But is that really a bad thing? I think not.

The game is set up with a total of nine different worlds and environments, with a total of 88 levels. You'll travel through many familiar surroundings from previous games and run into some familiar enemies. This doesn't mean that you're just playing a remake of the same game you've played before. Sure, you'll get your Starman suit, or jump on a few Goombas, but the game's magic is really in the platforming, level designs, and newly developed suits. For instance, in the frozen levels, you can acquire a penguin suit that will allow you to belly-flop onto the ground and skid across entire frozen areas, killing anything in your path. It can also double as the frog suit during swimming sequences. Another suit attaches a propeller to your character, and with the flick of your wrist, sends your character spinning of flying/floating to a new destination.

While the game can be challenging in a few spots, the game was a bit too easy for the most part. There's a few levels that will snatch lives from you, but you're never going to be left feeling like the game is impossible. This is a good and bad thing, depending on your play style. What really makes little sense is the addition of the Super Guide mode. It allows the game to play for you, skipping a difficult section or level that is just too tough for you. It's activated when the game realises that you're not any good, and you've died several times on the same level. In the old days, we called the Super Guide the level skip code. But the feature being implemented into the game without some type of cheat code just feels cheap. It takes ""hold your hand"" gameplay to a new level.

If you're not taking the simple road to victory, you'll be collecting coins that can be spent at the beginning castle. The things you'll end up buying are videos of secret places throughout the game, or incredible speed runs. The speed runs were jaw-dropping incredible, as a matter of fact. Often times, I wish I had better friends to play with so we could pull off these moves, but no such friends exist.

Actually, these friends do exist, just in another state. Nintendo has opted out of including any type of online play, which means you need to plan couch co-op parties to really enjoy the game with friends. This is one of the only draw backs to the game itself, but Nintendo did give a good enough reason of why it wasn't added. In this game, precision is everything. If there's a tiny spike in lag, you're likely to have a character fly off a map or miss a platform that's hard to hit. LittleBigPlanet on the PlayStation 3 managed to have online play, but there's not near as much platform jumping involved as in New Super Mario Bros. Wii.

You really can't go wrong with a Super Mario adventure usually, and New Super Mario Bros. Wii isn't breaking this trend. For the slightly few things it didn't get correct, it manages to master everything else. This is a full scale Super Mario, and feels like a sequel to the Super Mario Bros. more than just another money grabbing scheme cooked up by a company looking to make some quick cash.

+ Classic gameplay from the 21st century.
+ Co-op mode is a blast.
- You never feel like you're going to ""lose"". Especially with a mode like ""Super Guide"".

5.0	"Great mouse for pc gaming. Everything you need for games such as Minecraft. I don't think it would work as well with BF or COD due to the DPI. Changing the DPI is a breeze though with just a little tap of a button on top it goes from 1000, to 1600, or to 2000. Great price. Serves its purpose well for us.
*8/29/14 update: still works fantastic. I just wish the little scroller clicked a bit more when scrolling down a page. But not a big deal. Great for casual ....wouldn't recommend for hardcore gamers."

5.0	I'm a girl with a way with words. In my younger years,I've always hated math. But words are this girl's best friend! See,we have the board game-and I was thrilled to see that it came out on the DS hand-held game! Now I've tried it a little bit,but before I explain what I think,I've read different reviews about it. To some customers,they weren't too happy with the way the game wad operating,but-it didn't cause me any problems. Maybe I'm missing something here. But yet,I'm glad you had it so I deeply appreciate it! Like I mentioned earlier,I tried it a little bit,yet I need to learn how to play it. Just know this-I thank you for this game,because I AM a girl with a way with words! A Way with Words
5.0	"This game is a great RPG with lots of fun. It has some better things in it than Diablo 2. In Diablo 2 you only have one player and he/she has only one skill. In Dungeon Siege you get up to 8 players and pick the gender of your character and how he/she looks. On top of that you get to pick what skill you use. Whether you favor sword, bow, battleaxe, or one of the two different types of magic (nature and combat magic), you'll become an expert at the one you use most.
Another thing is it has an exellent story. ""From birth, you've toiled in the fields, poor yet proud. But the evil Krugs destroyed it all: your farm, your family, your friends. As something inside you dies, something else awakens-a warrior with a burning need for revenge. As you battle your way through a vast world of mountains, deserts, ice caverns, and dungeons, you'll forge a fearsome party to fight the forces of evil. But beware: as your power increases, so does the intensity of combat."" As you fight the Krugs and other monsters and kill the Krug leader, a new evil awakens far away in the Castle Ehb. An evil so powerful and mighty, it could kill the king himself, and rule the world.... Great Game, Lots of Fun"

5.0	As a fan of the Silent HIll series since 2004, I have to say I really enjoyed this game. A few things are a little different, but that's what happens when they come out with new games for the series. You get used to the new controls and things they changed. Isn't the most scary game or best plot in the series, but if you love Silent Hill, you'll love this game. Overall I loved it, and enjoyed the storyline (not my favorite, but it's good). Totally worth playing if you love survival horror, or the Silent Hill series in general. Totally Worth Playing

WWE '12 was cheaper than WWE '13. I wanted to wait for the right time to purchase the game. I did earlier this year I bought WWE '13 & I did have a great experience with this game!

5.0	I like it so far. awesome.
5.0	If you people didn't like Agent Under Fire then why do u think this game will be so different.  It's made by the same company as Agent Under Fire, and it's not Rareware who made Goldeneye.  Dosen't everyone know that by now?  Anyway, I liked Agent Under Fire for some reason, and they say this is as close to Goldeneye as a Bond game can get, and I liked Goldeney a lot, so I'm gonna buy this game when it comes out (NOW). Night Fire: Fire at night.
5.0	When I first bought this game it was because I was running a low grade laptop I bought specifically to use as a throw away model just to get me through my Iraq deployment. I got a little bored with watching the same DVDs over and over when I had downtime so I purchased this game since it was relatively cheap. As it turns out this is probably one of the most fun single player computer games I have ever played. I was immediately enveloped with the game progression. Trying to kill off enough bandits and run enough errands for the nobles to get conscripted into their army so that I could make my self known and get my own plot of land and build my own army. It was quite an engrossing experience...unfortunately the only bad thing is you have to connect to the internet in order to register the game to keep playing. Other than that I enjoyed this game up until the moment that my hard drive died and the crappy old laptop had to get retired from service. Surprisingly addictive.

5.0	Very cool Amiibo, but I really hope this becomes collectors item Very good price
5.0	"Assassin's Creed is one of the best games I have ever played. The storyline is intense, the gameplay, controls, and combat magnificent, and the graphics top-of-the-line.

STORY:
Assassin's Creed is about a man named Desmond who is kidnapped by a company that wants him to go back in time and control one of his ancestors using the Animus: a strange machine that allows access to ""cell-memories"" (a common theory that memories are passed along down generations through cells in the body).

In the Animus, you take control of an assassin, Altar. You start the game with all abilities and weapons, but as you control Altar, his actions get him in trouble, and his rank and most of his equipment is stripped. I have not finished the game yet, but for most of it (as of now), the rest is spent assassinating 9 characters in the game's three cities. When you assassinate each one, you will be ranked up and get a new ability (or two) and a piece of your equipment back. Each time you assassinate a boss, they will speak cryptically. Altar begins to think perhaps something is up -- all of these men believe that what they are doing is right in every way, that they are saving people, not harming them.

GAMEPLAY:
As Altar, you have incredible agility and speed. You can scale buildings and jump from rooftop to rooftop in mere seconds. When you're in combat, Altar can perform deadly maneuvers with his two types of combat-ready swords. He also possesses a hidden blade in his sleeve that you can use to silently kill anyone. Be wary, though. If there are many witnesses around, they may catch on that you just killed someone.

Crowds add a sense of realism to the gameplay, with everyone reacting to you and what you do at any moment. If you run like a madman through the city streets, you may hear whispers of ""he's going to hurt himself,"" or ""what's gotten into him?"" Scaling a building, you can hear ""what is that man doing?"". Every move you make is constantly being watched by someone, and if you act too suspiciously, the guards will catch on and begin to attack. Don't run into them, or they'll attack automatically. Beggars will follow you asking for money (though there is no way to do this, so if you're annoyed, either ignore them or switch to fists (""4"" key) and give them a good ol' punch in the face). Drunks and mental patients will push you away when you get near, and thugs will attack you if you get into a fist fight with them or someone nearby. The AI is very intelligent.

NOTE: Guards will NOT attack if you get into a fist fight (unless you get into a fist fight with a guard).

When you are caught by the guards, their actions and your escape are exceedingly unique, in that, if you climb a building, so do the guards. If you run, guards along the way will attack or leave you be depending on how close they were to where you first got caught. Finally, your escape methods are different. You have to find hiding spots, but the way that it works is that there is an icon in the upper-left corner of the screen: when it is red and in the shape of a triangle, you are in full view of the guards and you have to keep running. If it's yellow and in the shape of a triangle, you're out of view of the guards and have to find a hiding spot fast. When the icon is a blue triangle, you're hiding and slowly becoming ""anonymous"", the word the game uses to mean ""not in trouble and not suspicious"". Finally, when the icon is gray and flashing green, you're safe. You can hide in many places, most of them being piles of hay, little ""rooms"" on rooftops, and benches where other people are sitting. If you're on a high building and below you on the ground is a hay bale, when you jump off that building, Altar will do a sky-dive maneuver and land straight in the hay.

Some people may be offended by the comments made in the game -- as it's taking place during the time of the Crusades and in Israel, Christians were largely persecuted. You will hear protestors on the street complaining of the ""Christian King and his infidels"". I also seem to remember hearing the ""British King and his infidels"" once, as well. Altar never explicitly shows what religion he follows and tends to remain neutral in his assassinations. The game also is not portrayed as being ""pro-"" anything. It also states at the beginning of the game right after the ""Ubisoft"" ad that it was created by a large group of people with diverse religious beliefs and customs.

Finally, the game uses a unique ""synchronization"" method in gameplay. Synchronization is basically Altar's health bar -- when he's fully synchronized, he's at full health and can use the special ""eagle eye"" ability. You lose synchronization in a few ways, either by falling from heights, getting hit when in a fight, and killing innocents. When Altar dies, you are ""desynchronized"" and must restart from the nearest Checkpoint (luckily, there are many checkpoints along the way -- you are never left wanting for one).

CONTROLS:
The controls take some getting used to, but are extremely imaginative. On the default settings, the shift key controls the ""non-fighting"" hand, the space key controls the legs, the E key controls the head, and the left mouse button controls the fighting hand. Holding down the right mouse button will allow you to perform a number of actions, such as run and block.

GRAPHICS:
The graphics are simply spectacular, but you need a very powerful graphics card to use them on the highest settings. I get fairly high FPS, even on the highest possible settings, using my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/EVGA-e-GeForce-9500-GT-512-MB-DDR2-PCI-E-2-0-Graphics-Card-512-P3-N954-TR/dp/B001E4RZ72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">EVGA e-GeForce 9500 GT 512 MB DDR2 PCI-E 2.0 Graphics Card 512-P3-N954-TR</a>. Every texture is rendered incredibly and that coupled with lighting, bloom, shadow, and multisampling make the game have a very realistic feeling.

BOTTOM LINE:
This game is a must-have, though if you are easily offended by comments against Christians, be warned as there are some not-so-nice comments made that are supposed to help the game be more historically accurate.

As I stated above, the graphics are spectacular but require a fairly good graphics card to run with a decent framerate.

The storyline is innovative and creative, exploring parts of history that not many know of. The combat is difficult, but satisfying, and the stealth-action genre has received another great addition to its collection. A Masterpiece and Worth the Price"
5.0	I like this game. Five Stars
5.0	I remember buying this game on the PS2 way back in 2007. I had to buy another copy on the PS2 in 2014 because of how badly scratched it was. When I got to the last story, it would always lock up. Now in 2017, I got an Amazon card and used it to buy this game on the GameCube. The game came in with NO SCRATCHES o ANYTHING in particular. The disc was crystal clear. I only did 1 ending so far. I am happy with my purchase and I would buy it again if this copy stops working! Right in my childhood!
5.0	Very nice controller. Best one I have ever had. Needed to use JoyToKey in order to use it with Street Fighter V. Just map the correct keyboard inputs to the controller inputs and you are good to go. Works on PS4 and PS3 just fine. Used to play fighting games, mainly Street Fighter V. Works on PS4, PS3, and PC just fine.
5.0	"I've been playing De Blob 2 for a couple weeks now, after buying it on release day.  The first De Blob was one of my favorite games for the Wii.  I bought this de Blob 2 for the PS3 because I wanted to play the game in HD.

I was slightly worried about the transition from using a Wii controller to using the PS3 controller.  I was pleasantly surprised though.  When playing on the Wii, my arms would start to hurt from flicking the remote.  The PS3 version (when played with the regular controller, not the ""Move"") only requires minimal use of the controller's motion sensor.  The controls are smooth and it was an easy transition from Wii to PS3.

As in the first de Blob, evil creatures have taken over the world and removed its color.  Your job as De Blob is to add color to the world by painting yourself and then touching objects.  Various enemies try to spray you with black gunk as you make your way through the levels.

Each level has a main goal - such as liberating university professors and students from a black and white world.  After completing the main objective, there are ancillary quests such as repainting billboards or bringing trees back to life.  There are also various items to collect - such as light bulbs that allow you to upgrade De Blob, purple swirls that make De Blob paint in patterns instead of just plain color, and pictures for the picture gallery.

This game is rather hypnotic and relaxing.  I've only been frustrated once so far when I kept running out of time on one particular level.  I've played about 14 hours now and think I have about halfway to go.  The ancillary missions comprise about 25% of the play time, so if these missions don't interest you, the game will likely be quite short.

I love this game and hope the developers come out with a third iteration. Fantastic"
5.0	I would compare it to the rest of the Mortal Kombat games. I liked how it was fun but still tied into the rest of the Mortal Kombat video games. PS1 game
5.0	Works great. Replaced my other astro mix-amp which randomly broke. Like the new design tho, and the knobs feel a lot smoother. Works great. Replaced my other astro mix-amp which randomly broke

5.0	Great addition to our collection Five Stars
5.0	The best first person shooter since the original Halo! Absolutely first-class lads. I haven't had this much fun in a game since I first played Halo on the Xbox. This really is the best. The graphics are the best we've ever seen almost like real life and the sound made me think I was outside with all technological crap going on in the sky and gems everywhere. This is absolutely fantastic. No one has the right to say anything bad about Destiny The Taken King Legendary Edition! absolute 110% bliss quality!
5.0	"I bought this for my boyfriend who ended up buying one for me. That's how much he loved it, he wanted me to get into it. I really enjoy it, too. His pitch was that it's similar to TERA where you fight monsters in the same sort of way.

The fighting is fun and it's easy to maneuver the character around. The monsters look like dinosaurs and the maps are fun to explore. I was hesitant at first because I prefer these sort of games on a PC but it's actually pretty great and convenient on the DS~ That's how much he loved it, he wanted me to get into it"
5.0	grandson loves it Five Stars
5.0	It is an awesome game! I really like the changes that they made from the last gen GTA5 to the New gen GTA5. I love that I can shoot in first person now and am able to drive vehicles in first person. The colors look brighter, and you  can have a huge party in the game to play with a lot of people. GTA FTW

It lives to the Street Fighter tradition!!
Hadoken!!! Quite amazing graphics!!"
5.0	I bought this for my son and husband, both of whom are accomplished guitar players and they both have fun with this.  You use your own regular, real guitar for this game and it's probably good to help someone learn to play, too.  We bought the second cable so they can play guitars together and they have lots of fun with it even though they play most of the songs on their own anyway.  My husband has some difficulty with keeping time and this is definitely helping him; he always played guitar alone and didn't have the opportunity to keep up with a band until recently.  If you've got a teenager (of any age, hee hee) who just sits and plays guitar in his room alone, this would help for when he/she gets together with other people to play for real; it helps with the timing.  I definitely recommend this for all levels of play and it also has proven to be something that brings family and/or friends together!  When they're playing this game together, they have to work together and that improves relationships across the board! Great For Experienced Players!
5.0	I am very pleased with this charger. It is very easy to set up, and simple to put in the battery packs into the remote. They hold a good charge, especially considering how much my daughter plays. I am very happy with this purchase. Cool Charger and works well.
5.0	"Was recieved as advertised! Case jacket on the case. Booklet included. Both keycodes were working, as they are printed on the booklet. Not a scratch on these discs (all discs were there).  Only reservation is that the seller advertised they would help with installation if necessary; which is neither necessary because it practically installs itself perfectly, nor is it convenient to contact seller because there was no invoice enclosed. But hey, its cool. I can play this (both DoW and Winter Assault) on my newest computer, unlike SoulStorm.

If you are unfamiliar with Dawn Of War, it's a real time strategy game (RTS).  Infact, may be the best ever. You can even paint your own army colors! I enjoy that thoroughly! The way that this RTS works is by acquiring and keeping strategy points, which result in your revenue.  The more you claim, the faster you can upgrade. No tedious resource gathering, peasant by peasant.  YOU CAN FOCUS ON THE BATTLE! Much akin to Kohan 2.  These two franchises are my favorite RTS of all time. Have you played Dawn Of War 2? Well, this is nothing like that... otherthan it's license from Games Workshop. Get this somehow, or else you miss out!!!"
5.0	When I got this,I had doubts because of the ratings. I took the chance and I'm happy I did. It works great. I love it.
5.0	At this point, Timesplitters looks awesome.  I have seen screenshots and movies, they show that the game is fast paced and looks very promising.  With a level editor, more than a dozen playable characters, and the expertiese of the goldeneye team, you can't go wrong with this game.  This is my first game to get at launch time. Looking Awesome!
5.0	I received when they told me I was supposed to be receiving. Satisfied with it and I will buy more! Good
5.0	Had a blast playing this.  You will too. Five Stars
5.0	Love it, it's my second x box and I'm comparing it to the Xbox 360 slim, my only complaint is there are fewer USB ports then the 360 slim but other then that it's smaller sleeker and probably faster Comparison to Xbox 360 slim

5.0	My wife and I loved this game.  The rabbids are pretty funny and smacking them around is a blast.  I thought it was going to be a let down at first sight but it turned out to be fun.  Story mode was just a warm up for the challenges you'll face during multiplayer, which wasn't bad at all.  The achievements are pretty tough, you'll have to be pretty dedicated to get them.  But all in all, I recommend this game to anyone especially if you have friends come over alot. Great party game!!
5.0	Wow! What a great game! Both career mode and arcade mode are totally great! You want to impress Gordan as soon as the game starts! I love it! A Great gift for the show watchers and cooking lovers! Keeps you on you toes!
5.0	There are sometimes where you look at classic video games, and how much they've impacting the gaming industry. While there are great games out there that have been well-receieved like Halo, Doom, Madden '06, and others that've really shown a great depth of universal appeal. That has definitely also been the case with Mario. Since 1981, as Jumpman in Donkey Kong, Mario has been the most universal of all the video game characters and personas ever, and continues to develop with the times. That also has been shown with the Nintendo DS as well. The breakout success of Nintendo's latest handheld system has really been a great transition to how we play video games on hand with the stylus, and appeal of the dual screen action. Now, Mario is set to have that classic feeling all over again. Very good game... History game
5.0	"I LOVED this game. A real gaming milestone in every sense of the word.  One of the best and most complex, immersive, satisfying gaming experiences of my life -- I've been obsessed with it for THREE WEEKS.  I played it three times through, and was never bored once.

ETERNAL DARKNESS: SANITY'S REQUIEM offers everything gamers hope for in a game (and far too often, are disappointed): a strong heroine, great and interesting and very varied characters (you will play for more than 12 -- young, old, male, female, fat, thin, etc, throughout history), a  fantastic storyline, superb rendering for the GC with no visible load times or slowdowns.

Absolutely not for kids (it's violent and really, really scary), ETERNAL DARKNESS is a smart, violent, atmospheric -- and an unbelievably great combination of adventure and combat. The visuals, puzzles, and powers just get better and better as the game progresses, and the finale is moving and unexpectedly intelligent (the whole game is beautifully written and as satisfying as finishing a great novel).

NON-SPOILERY ADVICE: Save often, experiment with spells as soon as you have enough runes, and target the heads (R-targeting in combo with stick allows you to choose which body parts of enemies to go after).  I would also suggest that -- if you get stuck -- you use hint systems versus walkthroughs (which in this case especially can spoil the game).

NOTE: It is very important when you are playing KARIM (Ch4), ROBERTO (Ch8), and MICHAEL EDWARDS (Ch11) that you fully explore the levels. You should come away with something important here that will affect gameplay in the finale. There is also an extra and very important magical item discovery to be made when playing DR. LINDSEY (Chapter 6) that will affect gameplay enormously (and it's just loads of fun) so be aware you should complete this level with yet another magical weapon of sorts.

However, please note that you can skip all of the above and still finish the game, it's just harder (and not as much fun, as the extra spellcasting is part of the coolness).

STARTING UP: I would suggest playing the Ulyaoth (BLUE, magical) alignment first (have Pious pick the blue artifact in the beginning), then if you replay (and the game offers wonderful replay incentives with different monsters, key moments, and levels of difficulty for each of three different levels), you can play Chatturgha (RED, health) which is a bit tougher combatwise but with slightly easier boss battles.  If you play a third time for the secret ending (and it was a lot of fun), play Xelotath (GREEN, sanity) last. It's hardest of the three but at that point you'll have the experience to know what to do, and can (...)and enjoy the gameplay.  Completing the game a second time gives you more illuminating final dialogue and the chance to skip to the sections of your choice, while completing a third time offers a secret (and vital) extended epilogue covering all three of the games you just finished -- and what they really mean.

And ED:SR isn't just about health or magical powers like most games, but also requires that you maintain your character's sanity. I would therefore totally recommend allowing your character's sanity levels to drop deliberately from time to time, just because the insanity stuff is so inventive and is so much fun. And be warned -- if the game suddenly does some strange things to you, or you find your controls acting strangely, don't be too hasty to restart or check your console, as ED:SR likes to play with your head as well as your character's!

Ultimately this is a brilliant and worthy title for the Gamecube -- one I wish they would continue with in a sequel or follow-up (I'd buy it without even reading a review).

So if you're at all adventurous, buy it, try it, and by the time you're through, you won't be disappointed. Although you may not be all that sane, either... ;-) Saving the World (and Your Sanity) Over 2000 Years"
5.0	"Just to make this short, and not bore you with the story of how I decided to get a PS3 over Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii.
Nintendo Wii are non existent and I even went over the Internet to get the PS3 since they wer giving away the same doorbuster deal at the stores website and I already had $175.00 in gift cards. Xbox 360 is more expensive than PS3 if you want to have wireless internet access and HD DVD.
Getting 1 Game and Two movies free instantly plus 5 movies free by mail, also helped. I wanted a system that would also let me enjoy my HDTV to it's highest potential. I have a 720p but once the PS3 detected the TV it showed its highest resolution is 1080i. To be honest I see no difference between both, but I enjoy a crisper image. But to get this quality you should get an HDMI there is one offered in amazon.com for 37 cents, you read right. It is offered by SF Planet. I ordered it on Friday night and by Wednesday I had it in my mail box. It costs over

What I Like

* Integrated Hi Fi -If I had read the manual might have taken me less, still took me about 20 minutes to set it up with my wireless network.

* BD Player- Movies look much better even compared to DVD's in 480p. Main reason to get it

* Hi definition gaming- You can still get the 80 GB version if you are a hardcore gamer

* Sony Store- You can download free demos so you don't end up paying 60 bucks for a game that you end up not liking at all. Example Resistance fall of men looked interesting but FPS is no my favorite Genre and I didn't like it. Also you can download PS1 games payed. Also available free are videos of BD movies, Theatrical trailers and game trailers.

* Can customize the wall paper with your favorite picture just like you would a computer.

* You can surf with some limitations the internet, at least you can read your emails.

* Being able to charge the controls connecting the USB cable to a computer.

What I don't like:

* Not being able to play Gears of War.

* This version doesn't have the card reader the 80 GB has

* 4 usb ports are more convenient than 2 but I can live with that.

* BD vs. HD DVD war still going on I don't want to end up with a collection of unplayable media. And it doesn't get as hot as people say"
5.0	"Just to start off... To get the English language option, you must first install the patch. Once that >10MB patch is installed  You'll be go to go.

Airship Q is an Adventure platforming game, with mostly destructible environments (think Splunky). There is a simple crafting system, that is locked (in quest mode) behind the required checkpoints on the trip. It seems to be simple enough, and with a fairly required reading skill that younger players from 8+ should be able to play and enjoy the game.

As this is a Japanese game, it's game rating is ""A"", this is very close to the ESRB rating of E for Everyone. I would say that there is Cartoon/Fantasy Violence, as you must punch skeletons for bone material, for crafting a bone club before you can break stone. The only thing about failing is a death count... ""You died"" or ""You fell"" and 10 sec later... ""You woke up"" and your character can move again and has been re-spawned at the airship.

The quest mode starts off inside a prison, that will explain some of the most basic mechanics of the game. There are a few additional things new players can learn by looking in the menu. There are a few limited control options, but as of the English update, there is no way to change the X and O default, that is reversed (compared to most western releases) so that Circle is Ok, and X is cancel. This is a minor thing that bugged me for the first two hours of play, and after the third hour has become less of an annoyance.

Shortly after you start, you will find the airship. This is where the game's charm really starts to shine. You control the airship with the left analog stick, and it's not said but I recommend pressing down to zoom out your view when flying around.

The different islands can be approached in what ever way you feel. If you drain your resources, you can also fly back to previous islands or attack other ships. I don't know if there are a finite number of enemy ships to get randomly generated, all the other enemies seem to be endless.

Pros:
+ Works on PSTV
+ Lots of ways to take on each step of the journey.
+ Board and Loot enemy ships like a pirate.

Cons:
- You might struggle with the controls.
- Only one save game per memory card.

This game did not disappoint so far. I'm about 4 hours into it, and still enjoying the game greatly. Fly high and play in English!"
5.0	"I want to love this.  I REALLY want to love this, but I'm having some technical issues that are killing the whole experience for me.  I played the first Rocksmith on the 360, with a '95 Fender Strat.  No issues, great learning tool, etc.  Playing with the same guitar, same TV, same surround sound speakers, but now with the new game on the PS3, I experience a ton of feedback whenever I turn my volume up (to 43 on my system).  It's just barely loud enough to hear, but not louder than the actual strings on my guitar, so it just sounds like I'm really sucking trying to play an unplugged guitar with the radio on in the other room.  No fun at all.  I've googled for help, but haven't found anything.  If I can fix the issue, I'll update my review.  I tried turning my speakers around, or facing them down and I'm already sitting as far back as I can.  I have messed with the guitar volume, and both tone dials.  I even tried raising and lowering my pickups.  No dice.

As far as the actual game, I still played it for over an hour.  It's a great tool!  So many tools to nail down different tunings, different backing bands, different effects, timing, chords, structure.  Pretty much EVERYTHING you could ever imagine to want to learn about guitar technique is available here.  And, its all available right away.  There are things to unlock, but nothing that will hold you back or limit your ability to play or learn from the game.

I was kinda indifferent about the song list, some great stuff, some duds, lots of stuff I hadn't heard of, etc.  but it's actually very well put together.  The songs are selected to highlight different techniques, and they are fun and challenging within each of those lessons (as far as I can tell from not being able to hear much!)  The minigames are very fun, and well done.  They don't feel like a tacked on afterthought, and they even have online leaderboards!  It's not just running scales or strumming chords either.  You're defending a saloon from bandits, riding the back of a whale, shooting ducks, etc.  Very fun, and a nice break from some of the longer lessons.

One complaint is the controls.  There are a jillion menus available at any time, which is great, but can be pretty confusing at first.  RS14 seems to rely more on the SQUARE button, than the typical X button system that most games use, or even the CIRCLE/B button that Japanese games favor.  Took a little getting used to.  Also, when your selection is highlighted, its HUGE and on a different background, different color, etc.  For whatever reason, I wouldn't even notice the highlighted selection and always though I was selecting whatever was listed UNDER that giant highlighting bar.  Maybe that's just me, but I kept doing it and getting confused the first several lessons.  One HUGE plus is that you can invert the strings.  I learned guitar tablature nearly 20 years ago with EADGBE starting on the bottom of the screen.  The game defaults with EADGBE starting at the top of the screen.  I inverted it immediately and it was pretty straightforward.

There is a 60 Day School kind of program too.  Play an hour a day for 60 days and... Well, they don't say what happens, but I like that the discipline and structure are there.  It gives an easy goal to keep your eye on, and you need that motivation when learning an instrument.  It doesn't have to be 60 days in a row, by the way.

Overall, it's driving me nuts that this didn't work for me!  I'm taking it to a friends home soon to try out there.  Again, if I can conquer this issue, I'll edit my review.  Clearly, its a fantastic game, and I hope this huge technical issue is limited to my experience.

EDIT

IT WAS THE MOVE CAMERA!!! I'm such an idiot.  My Playstation Move Camera was plugged in, and it has a microphone.  THAT'S why I was getting feedback.  A friend mentioned it the other day and so I pulled out my copy and tried it, and it was fixed!  That's why it doesn't feedback on the Xbox, because there's no camera plugged in.  Anyway, if you have a PS Camera UNPLUG IT before you play Rocksmith.  I added a star to my review, because it really is a great learning tool, and they keep pumping out DLC tracks every week or two.  Thanks to everyone for your suggestions! Bigger, Better, Faster"

5.0	No problems with this mouse. It's somehow even better than my Corsair M65 was, and that one lasted me a while. Cool color options, useful button mapping software, 10/10 Awesome mouse
5.0	Mu grandkids love it....such great screen presence....the graffics are amazing..hours of fun... Kids...and some big kids too...LOVE IT!!!
5.0	Great graphics, storyline, and really fun gameplay.  I really love the art style of the game as well, it is reminiscent of the Shin Megami Tensei series.  If you like games like Soul Sacrifice or Monster Hunter, this will be right up your alley. Freedom Wars Review
5.0	love it ! love it !
5.0	"I find the Vita a comfortable device to hold for short gaming sessions, but after a bit, I'm adjusting my hands to lessen cramping.  I suppose that could be a sign to take a break; I took it as a sign to purchase the Hand Grip by CTA Digital.

I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a quality grip, though I haven't tried others on the market to compare.  I can say this item gives the feeling of holding Dual Shock controller.  The rubberized coating isn't as pronounced as I expected, though that isn't a negative.  I think the texture feels great.  The item is one piece with a sliding lock mechanism to keep the Vita from slipping; once you have it locked in, the Vita is snug and isn't in danger of falling out of the cradle even when held upside down.  The headphone jack is easily accessible.  I use a 3.5mm M to 1/4"" F adapter so I can connect my nice headphones, and even with the grip locked in, there is enough room for the adapter to fit without obstruction.

The power button and volume buttons are accessible; however, the cart slot for inserting a Vita game is not, which means you'll have to remove the grip when switching games.  The grip itself only takes a moment to remove, but it is an extra step.  You also have to remove the grip to charge the Vita, since the USB port is covered as well.  The rear touch panel isn't obstructed, and with the grip installed, I'm cognizant of my fingers touching the back panel, something I wasn't when using the Vita previously.

Overall, I'm duly impressed.  It feels like a quality product, and not something cheap, even though it is relatively inexpensive.  Most importantly, it provides comfort while playing and simulates the feeling of holding a Dual Shock.

Please note, and this should go without saying, it makes the Vita even less portable than it already was, increasing the length of the device to ~8.5 inches. Get a Grip on Vita"
5.0	Corresponds to the description ! Five Stars
5.0	"If you've played Smash before, you know what you're getting.  This game is just as addicting as the others in the series.  Online matches are fun, haven't experienced any lag so far.  The only (small) complaint I have is the controls.  They take some getting used to if you're used to playing with a gamecube controller.  Thankfully, you can map the buttons to your liking.  When the new 3DS comes out with the extra shoulder button I think I'll be happier with the controls.

*UPDATE 10/5*

I've played a good amount of matches online, and about 1/4 of the matches are laggy.  Most are just annoying slow downs for anywhere from 1/2 a second to 5 seconds, but some are actually game pausing where the smash logo pops up in the lower right hand corner and loads.  The lag is frustrating to say the least.  It only happens in about a quarter of the matches, but it's there. Handheld Smash?! YES!!"
5.0	good game, totally new Five Stars
